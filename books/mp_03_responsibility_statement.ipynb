    "Since the time period for working on this project was really short, we met up in person for a couple of days and worked on each part of the project together. We did make a GitHub repo (as seen above) to easily share code, but for the most part we were in the same room looking at the same screens and working on the Mini Project together and share equal responsibility for each part. For the write-ups sections, each person read over and edited the parts but each part did have a main author, as listed below."
