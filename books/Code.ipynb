       "['\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nTHE TRAGEDY AT THE PALACE HOTEL\\n\\n\\nMr. Kesselbach stopped short on the threshold of the sitting-room, took\\nhis secretary\\'s arm and, in an anxious voice, whispered:\\n\\n\"Chapman, some one has been here again.\"\\n\\n\"Surely not, sir,\" protested the secretary. \"You have just opened the\\nhall-door yourself; and the key never left your pocket while we were\\nlunching in the restaurant.\"\\n\\n\"Chapman, some one has been here again,\" Mr. Kesselbach repeated. He\\npointed to a traveling-bag on the mantelpiece. \"Look, I can prove it.\\nThat bag was shut. It is now open.\"\\n\\nChapman protested.\\n\\n\"Are you quite sure that you shut it, sir? Besides, the bag contains\\nnothing but odds and ends of no value, articles of dress. . . .\"\\n\\n\"It contains nothing else, because I took my pocket-book out before we\\nwent down, by way of precaution. . . . But for that. . . . No, Chapman,\\nI tell you, some one has been here while we were at lunch.\"\\n\\nThere was a telephone on the wall. He took down the receiver:\\n\\n\"Hallo! . . . I\\'m Mr. Kesselbach. . . . Suite 415 . . . That\\'s right.\\n. . . Mademoiselle, would you please put me on to the Prefecture of\\nPolice . . . the detective department. . . . I know the number . . . one\\nsecond . . . Ah, here it is! Number 822.48. . . . I\\'ll hold the line.\"\\n\\nA moment later he continued:\\n\\n\"Are you 822.48? I should like a word with M. Lenormand, the chief of\\nthe detective-service. My name\\'s Kesselbach. . . . Hullo! . . . Yes, the\\nchief detective knows what it\\'s about. He has given me leave to ring him\\nup. . . . Oh, he\\'s not there? . . . To whom am I speaking? . . .\\nDetective-sergeant Gourel? . . . You were there yesterday, were you not,\\nwhen I called on M. Lenormand? Well, the same thing that I told M.\\nLenormand yesterday has occurred again to-day. . . . Some one has\\nentered the suite which I am occupying. And, if you come at once, you\\nmay be able to discover some clues. . . . In an hour or two? All right;\\nthanks. . . . You have only to ask for suite 415. . . . Thank you\\nagain.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nRudolf Kesselbach, nicknamed alternatively the King of Diamonds and the\\nLord of the Cape, possessed a fortune estimated at nearly twenty\\nmillions sterling. For the past week, he had occupied suite 415, on the\\nfourth floor of the Palace Hotel, consisting of three rooms, of which\\nthe two larger, on the right, the sitting-room and the principal\\nbedroom, faced the avenue; while the other, on the left, in which\\nChapman, the secretary, slept, looked out on the Rue de Judée.\\n\\nAdjoining this bedroom, a suite of five rooms had been reserved for Mrs.\\nKesselbach, who was to leave Monte Carlo, where she was at present\\nstaying, and join her husband the moment she heard from him.\\n\\nRudolf Kesselbach walked up and down for a few minutes with a thoughtful\\nair. He was a tall man, with a ruddy complexion, and still young; and\\nhis dreamy eyes, which showed pale blue through his gold-rimmed\\nspectacles, gave him an expression of gentleness and shyness that\\ncontrasted curiously with the strength of the square forehead and the\\npowerfully-developed jaws.\\n\\nHe went to the window: it was fastened. Besides, how could any one have\\nentered that way? The private balcony that ran round the flat broke off\\non the right and was separated on the left by a stone channel from the\\nbalconies in the Rue de Judée.\\n\\nHe went to his bedroom: it had no communication with the neighboring\\nrooms. He went to his secretary\\'s bedroom: the door that led into the\\nfive rooms reserved for Mrs. Kesselbach was locked and bolted.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t understand it at all, Chapman. Time after time I have noticed\\nthings here . . . funny things, as you must admit. Yesterday, my\\nwalking-stick was moved. . . . The day before that, my papers had\\ncertainly been touched. . . . And yet how was it possible? . . .\\n\\n\"It is not possible, sir!\" cried Chapman, whose honest, placid features\\ndisplayed no anxiety. \"You\\'re imagining things, that\\'s all. . . . You\\nhave no proof, nothing but impressions, to go upon. . . . Besides, look\\nhere: there is no way into this suite except through the entrance-lobby.\\nVery well. You had a special key made on the day of our arrival: and\\nyour own man, Edwards, has the only duplicate. Do you trust him?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I do! . . . He\\'s been with me for ten years! . . . But\\nEdwards goes to lunch at the same time that we do; and that\\'s a mistake.\\nHe must not go down, in future, until we come back.\"\\n\\nChapman gave a slight shrug of the shoulders. There was no doubt about\\nit, the Lord of the Cape was becoming a trifle eccentric, with those\\nincomprehensible fears of his. What risk can you run in an hotel,\\nespecially when you carry no valuables, no important sum of money on you\\nor with you?\\n\\nThey heard the hall-door opening. It was Edwards. Mr. Kesselbach called\\nhim:\\n\\n\"Are you dressed, Edwards? Ah, that\\'s right! . . . I am expecting no\\nvisitors to-day, Edwards . . . or, rather, one visitor only, M. Gourel.\\nMeantime, remain in the lobby and keep an eye on the door. Mr. Chapman\\nand I have some serious work to do.\"\\n\\nThe serious work lasted for a few minutes, during which Mr. Kesselbach\\nwent through his correspondence, read three or four letters and gave\\ninstructions how they were to be answered. But, suddenly, Chapman,\\nwaiting with pen poised, saw that Mr. Kesselbach was thinking of\\nsomething quite different from his correspondence. He was holding\\nbetween his fingers and attentively examining a pin, a black pin bent\\nlike a fish-hook:\\n\\n\"Chapman,\" he said, \"look what I\\'ve found on the table. This bent pin\\nobviously means something. It\\'s a proof, a material piece of evidence.\\nYou can\\'t pretend now that no one has been in the room. For, after all,\\nthis pin did not come here of itself.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not,\" replied the secretary. \"It came here through me.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s a pin which I used to fasten my tie to my collar. I took it\\nout last night, while you were reading, and I twisted it mechanically.\"\\n\\nMr. Kesselbach rose from his chair, with a great air of vexation, took a\\nfew steps and stopped.\\n\\n\"You\\'re laughing at me, Chapman, I feel you are . . . and you\\'re quite\\nright. . . . I won\\'t deny it, I have been rather . . . odd, since my\\nlast journey to the Cape. It\\'s because . . . well . . . you don\\'t know\\nthe new factor in my life . . . a tremendous plan . . . a huge thing\\n. . . I can only see it, as yet, in the haze of the future . . . but\\nit\\'s taking shape for all that . . . and it will be something colossal.\\n. . . Ah, Chapman, you can\\'t imagine. . . . Money I don\\'t care a fig\\nfor: I have money, I have too much money. . . . But this, this means a\\ngreat deal more; it means power, might, authority. If the reality comes\\nup to my expectations, I shall be not only Lord of the Cape, but lord of\\nother realms as well. . . . Rudolf Kesselbach, the son of the Augsburg\\nironmonger, will be on a par with many people who till now have looked\\ndown upon him. . . . He will even take precedence of them, Chapman; he\\nwill, take precedence of them, mark my words . . . and, if ever I . . .\"\\n\\nHe interrupted himself, looked at Chapman as though he regretted having\\nsaid too much and, nevertheless, carried away by his excitement,\\nconcluded:\\n\\n\"You now understand the reasons of my anxiety, Chapman. . . . Here, in\\nthis brain, is an idea that is worth a great deal . . . and this idea\\nis suspected perhaps . . . and I am being spied upon. . . . I\\'m\\nconvinced of it. . . .\"\\n\\nA bell sounded.\\n\\n\"The telephone,\" said Chapman.\\n\\n\"Could it,\" muttered Kesselbach, \"by any chance be . . . ?\" He took down\\nthe instrument. \"Hullo! . . . Who? The Colonel? Ah, good! Yes, it\\'s I.\\n. . . Any news? . . . Good! . . . Then I shall expect you. . . . You\\nwill come with one of your men? Very well. . . . What? No, we shan\\'t be\\ndisturbed. . . . I will give the necessary orders. . . . It\\'s as serious\\nas that, is it? . . . I tell you, my instructions will be positive.\\n. . . my secretary and my man shall keep the door; and no one shall be\\nallowed in. . . . You know the way, don\\'t you? . . . Then don\\'t lose a\\nminute.\"\\n\\nHe hung up the receiver and said:\\n\\n\"Chapman, there are two gentlemen coming. Edwards will show them in.\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"But M. Gourel . . . the detective-sergeant. . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"He will come later . . . in an hour. . . . And, even then, there\\'s no\\nharm in their meeting. So send Edwards down to the office at once, to\\ntell them. I am at home to nobody . . . except two gentlemen, the\\nColonel and his friend, and M. Gourel. He must make them take down the\\nnames.\"\\n\\nChapman did as he was asked. When he returned to the room, he found Mr.\\nKesselbach holding in his hand an envelope, or, rather, a little\\npocket-case, in black morocco leather, apparently empty. He seemed to\\nhesitate, as though he did not know what to do with it. Should he put\\nit in his pocket or lay it down elsewhere? At last he went to the\\nmantelpiece and threw the leather envelope into his traveling-bag:\\n\\n\"Let us finish the mail, Chapman. We have ten minutes left. Ah, a letter\\nfrom Mrs. Kesselbach! Why didn\\'t you tell me of it, Chapman? Didn\\'t you\\nrecognize the handwriting?\"\\n\\nHe made no attempt to conceal the emotion which he felt in touching and\\ncontemplating that paper which his wife had held in her fingers and to\\nwhich she had added a look of her eyes, an atom of her scent, a\\nsuggestion of her secret thoughts. He inhaled its perfume and, unsealing\\nit, read the letter slowly in an undertone, in fragments that reached\\nChapman\\'s ears:\\n\\n      \"Feeling a little tired. . . . Shall keep my room\\n      to-day. . . . I feel so bored. . . . When can I come\\n      to you? I am longing for your wire. . . .\"\\n\\n\"You telegraphed this morning, Chapman? Then Mrs. Kesselbach will be\\nhere to-morrow, Wednesday.\"\\n\\nHe seemed quite gay, as though the weight of his business had been\\nsuddenly relieved and he freed from all anxiety. He rubbed his hands and\\nheaved a deep breath, like a strong man certain of success, like a lucky\\nman who possessed happiness and who was big enough to defend himself.\\n\\n\"There\\'s some one ringing, Chapman, some one ringing at the hall door.\\nGo and see who it is.\"\\n\\nBut Edwards entered and said:\\n\\n\"Two gentlemen asking for you, sir. They are the ones. . . .\"\\n\\n\"I know. Are they there, in the lobby?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Close the hall-door and don\\'t open it again except to M. Gourel, the\\ndetective-sergeant. You go and bring the gentlemen in, Chapman, and tell\\nthem that I would like to speak to the Colonel first, to the Colonel\\nalone.\"\\n\\nEdwards and Chapman left the room, shutting the door after them. Rudolf\\nKesselbach went to the window and pressed his forehead against the\\nglass.\\n\\nOutside, just below his eyes, the carriages and motor-cars rolled along\\nin parallel furrows, marked by the double line of refuges. A bright\\nspring sun made the brass-work and the varnish gleam again. The trees\\nwere putting forth their first green shoots; and the buds of the tall\\nchestnuts were beginning to unfold their new-born leaves.\\n\\n\"What on earth is Chapman doing?\" muttered Kesselbach. \"The time he\\nwastes in palavering! . . .\"\\n\\nHe took a cigarette from the table, lit it and drew a few puffs. A faint\\nexclamation escaped him. Close before him stood a man whom he did not\\nknow.\\n\\nHe started back:\\n\\n\"Who are you?\"\\n\\nThe man--he was a well-dressed individual, rather smart-looking, with\\ndark hair, a dark moustache and hard eyes--the man gave a grin:\\n\\n\"Who am I? Why, the Colonel!\"\\n\\n\"No, no. . . . The one I call the Colonel, the one who writes to me\\nunder that . . . adopted . . . signature . . . is not you!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes . . . the other was only . . . But, my dear sir, all this, you\\nknow, is not of the smallest importance. The essential thing is that I\\n. . . am myself. And that, I assure you, I _am_!\"\\n\\n\"But your name, sir? . . .\"\\n\\n\"The Colonel . . . until further orders.\"\\n\\nMr. Kesselbach was seized with a growing fear. Who was this man? What\\ndid he want with him?\\n\\nHe called out:\\n\\n\"Chapman!\"\\n\\n\"What a funny idea, to call out! Isn\\'t my company enough for you?\"\\n\\n\"Chapman!\" Mr. Kesselbach cried again. \"Chapman! Edwards!\"\\n\\n\"Chapman! Edwards!\" echoed the stranger, in his turn. \"What are you\\ndoing? You\\'re wanted!\"\\n\\n\"Sir, I ask you, I order you to let me pass.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sir, who\\'s preventing you?\"\\n\\nHe politely made way. Mr. Kesselbach walked to the door, opened it and\\ngave a sudden jump backward. Behind the door stood another man, pistol\\nin hand. Kesselbach stammered:\\n\\n\"Edwards . . . Chap . . .\"\\n\\nHe did not finish. In a corner of the lobby he saw his secretary and his\\nservant lying side by side on the floor, gagged and bound.\\n\\nMr. Kesselbach, notwithstanding his nervous and excitable nature, was\\nnot devoid of physical courage; and the sense of a definite danger,\\ninstead of depressing him, restored all his elasticity and vigor.\\nPretending dismay and stupefaction, he moved slowly back to the\\nchimneypiece and leant against the wall. His hand felt for the electric\\nbell. He found it and pressed the button without removing his finger.\\n\\n\"Well?\" asked the stranger.\\n\\nMr. Kesselbach made no reply and continued to press the button.\\n\\n\"Well? Do you expect they will come, that the whole hotel is in\\ncommotion, because you are pressing that bell? Why, my dear sir, look\\nbehind you and you will see that the wire is cut!\"\\n\\nMr. Kesselbach turned round sharply, as though he wanted to make sure;\\nbut, instead, with a quick movement, he seized the traveling-bag, thrust\\nhis hand into it, grasped a revolver, aimed it at the man and pulled the\\ntrigger.\\n\\n\"Whew!\" said the stranger. \"So you load your weapons with air and\\nsilence?\"\\n\\nThe cock clicked a second time and a third, but there was no report.\\n\\n\"Three shots more, Lord of the Cape! I shan\\'t be satisfied till you\\'ve\\nlodged six bullets in my carcass. What! You give up? That\\'s a pity . . .\\nyou were making excellent practice!\"\\n\\nHe took hold of a chair by the back, spun it round, sat down a-straddle\\nand, pointing to an arm-chair, said:\\n\\n\"Won\\'t you take a seat, my dear sir, and make yourself at home? A\\ncigarette? Not for me, thanks: I prefer a cigar.\"\\n\\nThere was a box on the table: he selected an Upmann, light in color and\\nflawless in shape, lit it and, with a bow:\\n\\n\"Thank you! That\\'s a perfect cigar. And now let\\'s have a chat, shall\\nwe?\"\\n\\nRudolf Kesselbach listened to him in amazement. Who could this strange\\nperson be? . . . Still, at the sight of his visitor sitting there so\\nquiet and so chatty, he became gradually reassured and began to think\\nthat the situation might come to an end without any need to resort to\\nviolence or brute force.\\n\\nHe took out a pocket-book, opened it, displayed a respectable bundle of\\nbank-notes and asked:\\n\\n\"How much?\"\\n\\nThe other looked at him with an air of bewilderment, as though he found\\na difficulty in understanding what Kesselbach meant. Then, after a\\nmoment, he called:\\n\\n\"Marco!\"\\n\\nThe man with the revolver stepped forward.\\n\\n\"Marco, this gentleman is good enough to offer you a few bits of paper\\nfor your young woman. Take them, Marco.\"\\n\\nStill aiming his revolver with his right hand, Marco put out his left,\\ntook the notes and withdrew.\\n\\n\"Now that this question is settled according to your wishes,\" resumed\\nthe stranger, \"let us come to the object of my visit. I will be brief\\nand to the point. I want two things. In the first place, a little black\\nmorocco pocket-case, shaped like an envelope, which you generally carry\\non you. Secondly, a small ebony box, which was in that traveling-bag\\nyesterday. Let us proceed in order. The morocco case?\"\\n\\n\"Burnt.\"\\n\\nThe stranger knit his brows. He must have had a vision of the good old\\ndays when there were peremptory methods of making the contumacious\\nspeak:\\n\\n\"Very well. We shall see about that. And the ebony box?\"\\n\\n\"Burnt.\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" he growled, \"you\\'re getting at me, my good man!\" He twisted the\\nother\\'s arm with a pitiless hand. \"Yesterday, Rudolf Kesselbach, you\\nwalked into the Crédit Lyonnais, on the Boulevard des Italiens, hiding a\\nparcel under your overcoat. You hired a safe . . . let us be exact: safe\\nNo. 16, in recess No. 9. After signing the book and paying your\\nsafe-rent, you went down to the basement; and, when you came up again,\\nyou no longer had your parcel with you. Is that correct?\"\\n\\n\"Quite.\"\\n\\n\"Then the box and the pocket-case are at the Crédit Lyonnais?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Give me the key of your safe.\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Marco!\"\\n\\nMarco ran up.\\n\\n\"Look sharp, Marco! The quadruple knot!\"\\n\\nBefore he had even time to stand on the defensive, Rudolf Kesselbach was\\ntied up in a network of cords that cut into his flesh at the least\\nattempt which he made to struggle. His arms were fixed behind his back,\\nhis body fastened to the chair and his legs tied together like the legs\\nof a mummy.\\n\\n\"Search him, Marco.\"\\n\\nMarco searched him. Two minutes after, he handed his chief a little\\nflat, nickel-plated key, bearing the numbers 16 and 9.\\n\\n\"Capital. No morocco pocket-case?\"\\n\\n\"No, governor.\"\\n\\n\"It is in the safe. Mr. Kesselbach, will you tell me the secret cypher\\nthat opens the lock?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"You refuse?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Marco!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, governor.\"\\n\\n\"Place the barrel of your revolver against the gentleman\\'s temple.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s there.\"\\n\\n\"Now put your finger to the trigger.\"\\n\\n\"Ready.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Kesselbach, old chap, do you intend to speak?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll give you ten seconds, and not one more. Marco!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, governor.\"\\n\\n\"In ten seconds, blow out the gentleman\\'s brains.\"\\n\\n\"Right you are, governor.\"\\n\\n\"Kesselbach, I\\'m counting. One, two, three, four, five, six . . .\"\\n\\nRudolph Kesselbach made a sign.\\n\\n\"You want to speak?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re just in time. Well, the cypher . . . the word for the lock?\"\\n\\n\"Dolor.\"\\n\\n\"Dolor . . . Dolor . . . Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s name is Dolores, I believe?\\nYou dear boy! . . . Marco, go and do as I told you. . . . No mistake,\\nmind! I\\'ll repeat it: meet Jérôme at the omnibus office, give him the\\nkey, tell him the word: Dolor. Then, the two of you, go to the Crédit\\nLyonnais. Jérôme is to walk in alone, sign the name-book, go down to the\\nbasement and bring away everything in the safe. Do you quite\\nunderstand?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, governor. But if the safe shouldn\\'t open; if the word Dolor . . .\"\\n\\n\"Silence, Marco. When you come out of the Crédit Lyonnais, you must\\nleave Jérôme, go to your own place and telephone the result of the\\noperation to me. Should the word Dolor by any chance fail to open the\\nsafe, we (my friend Rudolf Kesselbach and I) will have one . . . _last_\\n. . . interview. Kesselbach, you\\'re quite sure you\\'re not mistaken?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"That means that you rely upon the futility of the search. We shall see.\\nBe off, Marco!\"\\n\\n\"What about you, governor?\"\\n\\n\"I shall stay. Oh, I\\'m not afraid! I\\'ve never been in less danger than\\nat this moment. Your orders about the door were positive, Kesselbach,\\nwere they not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Dash it all, you seemed very eager to get that said! Can you have been\\ntrying to gain time? If so, I should be caught in a trap like a fool.\\n. . .\" He stopped to think, looked at his prisoner and concluded, \"No\\n. . . it\\'s not possible . . . we shall not be disturbed . . .\"\\n\\nHe had not finished speaking, when the door-bell rang. He pressed his\\nhand violently on Rudolf Kesselbach\\'s mouth:\\n\\n\"Oh, you old fox, you were expecting some one!\"\\n\\nThe captive\\'s eyes gleamed with hope. He could be heard chuckling under\\nthe hand that stifled him.\\n\\nThe stranger shook with rage:\\n\\n\"Hold your tongue, or I\\'ll strangle you! Here, Marco, gag him! Quick!\\n. . . That\\'s it!\"\\n\\nThe bell rang again. He shouted, as though he himself were Kesselbach\\nand as though Edwards were still there:\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you open the door, Edwards?\"\\n\\nThen he went softly into the lobby and, pointing to the secretary and\\nthe manservant, whispered:\\n\\n\"Marco, help me shift these two into the bedroom . . . over there . . .\\nso that they can\\'t be seen.\"\\n\\nHe lifted the secretary. Marco carried the servant.\\n\\n\"Good! Now go back to the sitting-room.\"\\n\\nHe followed him in and at once returned to the lobby and said, in a loud\\ntone of astonishment:\\n\\n\"Why, your man\\'s not here, Mr. Kesselbach. . . . No, don\\'t move . . .\\nfinish your letter. . . . I\\'ll go myself.\"\\n\\nAnd he quietly opened the hall-door.\\n\\n\"Mr. Kesselbach?\"\\n\\nHe found himself faced by a sort of jovial, bright-eyed giant, who stood\\nswinging from one foot to the other and twisting the brim of his hat\\nbetween his fingers. He answered:\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s right. Who shall I say. . . ?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Kesselbach telephoned. . . . He expects me. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s you. . . . I\\'ll tell him. . . . Do you mind waiting a minute?\\n. . . Mr. Kesselbach will speak to you.\"\\n\\nHe had the audacity to leave the visitor standing on the threshold of\\nthe little entrance-hall, at a place from which he could see a portion\\nof the sitting-room through the open door, and, slowly, without so much\\nas turning round, he entered the room, went to his confederate by Mr.\\nKesselbach\\'s side and whispered:\\n\\n\"We\\'re done! It\\'s Gourel, the detective. . . .\"\\n\\nThe other drew his knife. He caught him by the arm:\\n\\n\"No nonsense! I have an idea. But, for God\\'s sake, Marco, understand me\\nand speak in your turn. Speak _as if you were Kesselbach_. . . . You\\nhear, Marco! You _are_ Kesselbach.\"\\n\\nHe expressed himself so coolly, so forcibly and with such authority that\\nMarco understood, without further explanation, that he himself was to\\nplay the part of Kesselbach. Marco said, so as to be heard:\\n\\n\"You must apologize for me, my dear fellow. Tell M. Gourel I\\'m awfully\\nsorry, but I\\'m over head and ears in work. . . . I will see him\\nto-morrow morning, at nine . . . yes, at nine o\\'clock punctually.\"\\n\\n\"Good!\" whispered the other. \"Don\\'t stir.\"\\n\\nHe went back to the lobby, found Gourel waiting, and said:\\n\\n\"Mr. Kesselbach begs you to excuse him. He is finishing an important\\npiece of work. Could you possibly come back at nine o\\'clock to-morrow\\nmorning?\"\\n\\nThere was a pause. Gourel seemed surprised, more or less bothered and\\nundecided. The other man\\'s hand clutched the handle of a knife at the\\nbottom of his pocket. At the first suspicious movement, he was prepared\\nto strike.\\n\\nAt last, Gourel said:\\n\\n\"Very well. . . . At nine o\\'clock to-morrow. . . . But, all the same\\n. . . However, I shall be here at nine to-morrow. . . .\"\\n\\nAnd, putting on his hat, he disappeared down the passage of the hotel.\\n\\nMarco, in the sitting-room, burst out laughing:\\n\\n\"That was jolly clever of you, governor! Oh, how nicely you spoofed\\nhim!\"\\n\\n\"Look alive, Marco, and follow him. If he leaves the hotel, let him be,\\nmeet Jérôme at the omnibus-office as arranged . . . and telephone.\"\\n\\nMarco went away quickly.\\n\\nThen the man took a water-bottle on the chimneypiece, poured himself out\\na tumblerful, which he swallowed at a draught, wetted his handkerchief,\\ndabbed his forehead, which was covered with perspiration, and then sat\\ndown beside his prisoner and, with an affectation of politeness, said:\\n\\n\"But I must really have the honor, Mr. Kesselbach, of introducing myself\\nto you.\"\\n\\nAnd, taking a card from his pocket, he said: \"Allow me. . . . Arsène\\nLupin, gentleman-burglar.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe name of the famous adventurer seemed to make the best of impressions\\nupon Mr. Kesselbach. Lupin did not fail to observe the fact and\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n\"Aha, my dear sir, you breathe again! Arsène Lupin is a delicate,\\nsqueamish burglar. He loathes bloodshed, he has never committed a more\\nserious crime than that of annexing other people\\'s property . . . a mere\\npeccadillo, eh? And what you\\'re saying to yourself is that he is not\\ngoing to burden his conscience with a useless murder. Quite so. . . .\\nBut will your destruction be so useless as all that? Everything depends\\non the answer. And I assure you that I\\'m not larking at present. Come\\non, old chap!\"\\n\\nHe drew up his chair beside the arm-chair, removed the prisoner\\'s gag\\nand, speaking very plainly:\\n\\n\"Mr. Kesselbach,\" he said, \"on the day when you arrived in Paris you\\nentered into relations with one Barbareux, the manager of a confidential\\ninquiry agency; and, as you were acting without the knowledge of your\\nsecretary, Chapman, it was arranged that the said Barbareux, when\\ncommunicating with you by letter or telephone, should call himself \\'the\\nColonel.\\' I hasten to tell you that Barbareux is a perfectly honest man.\\nBut I have the good fortune to number one of his clerks among my own\\nparticular friends. That is how I discovered the motive of your\\napplication to Barbareux and how I came to interest myself in you and to\\nmake a search or two here, with the assistance of a set of false keys\\n. . . in the course of which search or two, I may as well tell you, I\\ndid not find what I was looking for.\"\\n\\nHe lowered his voice and, with his eyes fixed on the eyes of his\\nprisoner, watching his expression, searching his secret thoughts, he\\nuttered these words:\\n\\n\"Mr. Kesselbach, your instructions to Barbareux were that he should find\\na man hidden somewhere in the slums of Paris who bears or used to bear\\nthe name of Pierre Leduc. The man answers to this brief description:\\nheight, five feet nine inches; hair and complexion, fair; wears a\\nmoustache. Special mark: the tip of the little finger of the left hand\\nis missing, as the result of a cut. Also, he has an almost imperceptible\\nscar on the right cheek. You seem to attach enormous importance to this\\nman\\'s discovery, as though it might lead to some great advantage to\\nyourself. Who is the man?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\nThe answer was positive, absolute. Did he know or did he not know? It\\nmade little difference. The great thing was that he was determined not\\nto speak.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said his adversary, \"but you have fuller particulars about\\nhim than those with which you furnished Barbareux.\"\\n\\n\"I have not.\"\\n\\n\"You lie, Mr. Kesselbach. Twice, in Barbareux\\'s presence, you consulted\\npapers contained in the morocco case.\"\\n\\n\"I did.\"\\n\\n\"And the case?\"\\n\\n\"Burnt.\"\\n\\nLupin quivered with rage. The thought of torture and of the facilities\\nwhich it used to offer was evidently passing through his mind again.\\n\\n\"Burnt? But the box? . . . Come, own up . . . confess that the box is at\\nthe Crédit Lyonnais.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"And what\\'s inside it?\"\\n\\n\"The finest two hundred diamonds in my private collection.\"\\n\\nThis statement did not seem to displease the adventurer.\\n\\n\"Aha, the finest two hundred diamonds! But, I say, that\\'s a fortune!\\n. . . Yes, that makes you smile. . . . It\\'s a trifle to you, no doubt.\\n. . . And your secret is worth more than that. . . . To you, yes . . .\\nbut to me? . . .\"\\n\\nHe took a cigar, lit a match, which he allowed to go out again\\nmechanically, and sat for some time thinking, motionless.\\n\\nThe minutes passed.\\n\\nHe began to laugh:\\n\\n\"I dare say you\\'re hoping that the expedition will come to nothing and\\nthat they won\\'t open the safe? . . . Very likely, old chap! But, in that\\ncase, you\\'ll have to pay me for my trouble. I did not come here to see\\nwhat sort of figure you cut in an arm-chair. . . . The diamonds, since\\ndiamonds there appear to be . . . or else the morocco case. . . .\\nThere\\'s your dilemma.\" He looked at his watch. \"Half an hour. . . . Hang\\nit all! . . . Fate is moving very slowly. . . . But there\\'s nothing for\\nyou to grin at, Mr. Kesselbach. I shall not go back empty-handed, make\\nno mistake about that! . . . At last!\"\\n\\nIt was the telephone-bell. Lupin snatched at the receiver and, changing\\nthe sound of his voice, imitated the rough accent of his prisoner:\\n\\n\"Yes, Rudolf Kesselbach . . . you\\'re speaking to him. . . . Yes, please,\\nmademoiselle, put me on. . . . Is that you, Marco? . . . Good. . . . Did\\nit go off all right? . . . Excellent! . . . No hitch? . . . My best\\ncompliments! . . . Well, what did you pick up? . . . The ebony box?\\n. . . Nothing else? . . . No papers? . . . Tut, tut! . . . And what\\'s in\\nthe box? . . . Are they fine diamonds? . . . Capital, capital! . . . One\\nminute, Marco, while I think. . . . You see, all this. . . . If I were\\nto tell you my opinion. . . . Wait, don\\'t go away . . . hold the line.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nHe turned round.\\n\\n\"Mr. Kesselbach, are you keen on your diamonds?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Would you buy them back of me?\"\\n\\n\"Possibly.\"\\n\\n\"For how much? Five hundred thousand francs?\"\\n\\n\"Five hundred thousand . . . yes.\"\\n\\n\"Only, here\\'s the rub: how are we to make the exchange? A cheque? No,\\nyou\\'d swindle me . . . or else I\\'d swindle you. . . . Listen. On the day\\nafter to-morrow, go to the Crédit Lyonnais in the morning, draw out your\\nfive hundred bank-notes of a thousand each and go for a walk in the\\nBois, on the Auteuil side. . . . I shall have the diamonds in a bag:\\nthat\\'s handier. . . . The box shows too much. . . .\"\\n\\nKesselbach gave a start:\\n\\n\"No, no . . . the box, too. . . . I want everything. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" cried Lupin, shouting with laughter, \"you\\'ve fallen into the trap!\\n. . . The diamonds you don\\'t care about . . . they can be replaced.\\n. . . But you cling to that box as you cling to your skin. . . . Very\\nwell, you shall have your box . . . on the word of Arsène . . . you\\nshall have it to-morrow morning, by parcel post!\"\\n\\nHe went back to the telephone:\\n\\n\"Marco, have you the box in front of you? . . . Is there anything\\nparticular about it? . . . Ebony inlaid with ivory. . . . Yes, I know\\nthe sort of thing. . . . Japanese, from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.\\n. . . No mark? . . . Ah, a little round label, with a blue border and a\\nnumber! . . . Yes, a shop-mark . . . no importance. And is the bottom of\\nthe box thick? . . . Not very thick. . . . Bother! No false bottom,\\nthen? . . . Look here, Marco: just examine the ivory inlay on the\\noutside . . . or, rather, no, the lid.\" He reveled with delight. \"The\\nlid! That\\'s it, Marco! Kesselbach blinked his eyes just now. . . . We\\'re\\nburning! . . . Ah, Kesselbach, old chap, didn\\'t you see me squinting at\\nyou? You silly fellow!\" And, to Marco, \"Well, what do you see? . . . A\\nlooking-glass inside the lid? . . . Does it slide? . . . Is it on\\nhinges? . . . No! . . . Well, then, break it. . . . Yes, yes, I tell you\\nto break it. . . . That glass serves no purpose there . . . it\\'s been\\nadded since!\" He lost patience. \"Mind your own business, idiot! . . . Do\\nas I say! . . .\"\\n\\nHe must have heard the noise which Marco made at the other end of the\\nwire in breaking the glass, for he shouted, in triumph.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I tell you, Mr. Kesselbach, that we should find something? . . .\\nHullo! Have you done it? . . . Well? . . . A letter? Victory! All the\\ndiamonds in the Cape and old man Kesselbach\\'s secret into the bargain!\"\\n\\nHe took down the second receiver, carefully put the two discs to his\\nears and continued:\\n\\n\"Read it to me, Marco, read it to me slowly. . . . The envelope first.\\n. . . Good. . . . Now, repeat.\" He himself repeated, \"\\'Copy of the\\nletter contained in the black morocco case.\\' And next? Tear the\\nenvelope, Marco. . . . Have I your permission, Mr. Kesselbach? It\\'s not\\nvery good form, but, however . . . Go on, Marco, Mr. Kesselbach gives\\nyou leave. . . . Done it? . . . Well, then, read it out.\"\\n\\nHe listened and, with a chuckle:\\n\\n\"The deuce! That\\'s not quite as clear as a pikestaff! Listen. I\\'ll\\nrepeat: a plain sheet of paper folded in four, the folds apparently\\nquite fresh. . . . Good. . . . At the top of the page, on the right,\\nthese words: \\'Five feet nine, left little finger cut.\\' And so on. . . .\\nYes, that\\'s the description of Master Pierre Leduc. In Kesselbach\\'s\\nhandwriting, I suppose? . . . Good. . . . And, in the middle of the\\npage, this word in printed capitals: \\'APOON.\\' Marco, my lad, leave the\\npaper as it is and don\\'t touch the box or the diamonds. I shall have\\ndone with our friend here in ten minutes and I shall be with you in\\ntwenty. . . . Oh, by the way, did you send back the motor for me?\\nCapital! So long!\"\\n\\nHe replaced the instrument, went into the lobby and into the bedroom,\\nmade sure that the secretary and the manservant had not unloosed their\\nbonds and, on the other hand, that they were in no danger of being\\nchoked by their gags. Then he returned to his chief prisoner.\\n\\nHe wore a determined and relentless look:\\n\\n\"We\\'ve finished joking, Kesselbach. If you don\\'t speak, it will be the\\nworse for you. Have you made up your mind?\"\\n\\n\"What about?\"\\n\\n\"No nonsense, please. Tell me what you know.\"\\n\\n\"I know nothing.\"\\n\\n\"You lie. What does this word \\'APOON\\' mean?\"\\n\\n\"If I knew, I should not have written it down.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; but whom or what does it refer to? Where did you copy it?\\nWhere did you get it from?\"\\n\\nMr. Kesselbach made no reply. Lupin, now speaking in nervous, jerky\\ntones, resumed:\\n\\n\"Listen, Kesselbach, I have a proposal to make to you. Rich man, big man\\nthough you may be, there is not so much difference between us. The son\\nof the Augsburg ironmonger and Arsène Lupin, prince of burglars, can\\ncome to an understanding without shame on either side. I do my thieving\\nindoors; you do yours on the Stock Exchange. It\\'s all much of a\\nmuchness. So here we are, Kesselbach. Let\\'s be partners in this\\nbusiness. I have need of you, because I don\\'t know what it\\'s about. You\\nhave need of me, because you will never be able to manage it alone.\\nBarbareux is an ass. I am Lupin. Is it a bargain?\"\\n\\nNo answer. Lupin persisted, in a voice shaking with intensity:\\n\\n\"Answer, Kesselbach, is it a bargain? If so, I\\'ll find your Pierre Leduc\\nfor you in forty-eight hours. For he\\'s the man you\\'re after, eh? Isn\\'t\\nthat the business? Come along, answer! Who is the fellow? Why are you\\nlooking for him? What do you know about him?\"\\n\\nHe calmed himself suddenly, laid his hand on Kesselbach\\'s shoulder and,\\nharshly:\\n\\n\"One word only. Yes or no?\"\\n\\n\"No!\"\\n\\nHe drew a magnificent gold watch from Kesselbach\\'s fob and placed it on\\nthe prisoner\\'s knees. He unbuttoned Kesselbach\\'s waistcoat, opened his\\nshirt, uncovered his chest and, taking a steel dagger, with a\\ngold-crusted handle, that lay on the table beside him, he put the point\\nof it against the place where the pulsations of the heart made the bare\\nflesh throb:\\n\\n\"For the last time?\"\\n\\n\"No!\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Kesselbach, it is eight minutes to three. If you don\\'t answer\\nwithin eight minutes from now, you are a dead man!\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe next morning, Sergeant Gourel walked into the Palace Hotel\\npunctually at the appointed hour. Without stopping, scorning to take the\\nlift, he went up the stairs. On the fourth floor he turned to the right,\\nfollowed the passage and rang at the door of 415.\\n\\nHearing no sound, he rang again. After half-a-dozen fruitless attempts,\\nhe went to the floor office. He found a head-waiter there:\\n\\n\"Mr. Kesselbach did not sleep here last night. We have not seen him\\nsince yesterday afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"But his servant? His secretary?\"\\n\\n\"We have not seen them either.\"\\n\\n\"Then they also did not sleep in the hotel?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose not.\"\\n\\n\"You suppose not? But you ought to be certain.\"\\n\\n\"Why? Mr. Kesselbach is not staying in the hotel; he is at home here, in\\nhis private flat. He is not waited on by us, but by his own man; and we\\nknow nothing of what happens inside.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true. . . . That\\'s true. . . .\"\\n\\nGourel seemed greatly perplexed. He had come with positive orders, a\\nprecise mission, within the limits of which his mind was able to exert\\nitself. Outside those limits he did not quite know how to act:\\n\\n\"If the chief were here,\" he muttered, \"if the chief were here. . . .\"\\n\\nHe showed his card and stated his quality. Then he said, on the\\noff-chance:\\n\\n\"So you have not seen them come in?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"But you saw them go out?\"\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t say I did.\"\\n\\n\"In that case, how do you know that they went out?\"\\n\\n\"From a gentleman who called yesterday afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"A gentleman with a dark mustache?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I met him as he was going away, about three o\\'clock. He said: \\'The\\npeople in 415 have gone out. Mr. Kesselbach will stay at Versailles\\nto-night, at the Reservoirs; you can send his letters on to him there.\\'\"\\n\\n\"But who was this gentleman? By what right did he speak?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\nGourel felt uneasy. It all struck him as rather queer.\\n\\n\"Have you the key?\"\\n\\n\"No. Mr. Kesselbach had special keys made.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go and look.\"\\n\\nGourel rang again furiously. Nothing happened. He was about to go when,\\nsuddenly, he bent down and clapped his ear to the keyhole:\\n\\n\"Listen. . . . I seem to hear . . . Why, yes . . . it\\'s quite distinct.\\n. . . I hear moans. . . .\"\\n\\nHe gave the door a tremendous blow with his fist.\\n\\n\"But, sir, you have not the right . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh, hang the right!\"\\n\\nHe struck the door with renewed force, but to so little purpose that he\\nabandoned the attempt forthwith:\\n\\n\"Quick, quick, a locksmith!\"\\n\\nOne of the waiters started off at a run. Gourel, blustering and\\nundecided, walked to and fro. The servants from the other floors\\ncollected in groups. People from the office, from the manager\\'s\\ndepartment arrived. Gourel cried:\\n\\n\"But why shouldn\\'t we go in though the adjoining rooms? Do they\\ncommunicate with this suite?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but the communicating doors are always bolted on both sides.\"\\n\\n\"Then I shall telephone to the detective-office,\" said Gourel, to whose\\nmind obviously there existed no salvation without his chief.\\n\\n\"And to the commissary of police,\" observed some one.\\n\\n\"Yes, if you like,\" he replied, in the tone of a gentleman who took\\nlittle or no interest in that formality.\\n\\nWhen he returned from the telephone, the locksmith had nearly finished\\ntrying the keys. The last worked the lock. Gourel walked briskly in.\\n\\nHe at once hastened in the direction from which the moans came and hit\\nagainst the bodies of Chapman the secretary, and Edwards the manservant.\\nOne of them, Chapman, had succeeded, by dint of patience, in loosening\\nhis gag a little and was uttering short, stifled moans. The other seemed\\nasleep.\\n\\nThey were released. But Gourel was anxious:\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Mr. Kesselbach?\"\\n\\nHe went into the sitting-room. Mr. Kesselbach was sitting strapped to\\nthe back of the arm-chair, near the table. His head hung on his chest.\\n\\n\"He has fainted,\" said Gourel, going up to him. \"He must have exerted\\nhimself beyond his strength.\"\\n\\nSwiftly he cut the cords that fastened the shoulders. The body fell\\nforward in an inert mass. Gourel caught it in his arms and started back\\nwith a cry of horror:\\n\\n\"Why, he\\'s dead! Feel . . . his hands are ice-cold! And look at his\\neyes!\"\\n\\nSome one ventured the opinion:\\n\\n\"An apoplectic stroke, no doubt . . . or else heart-failure.\"\\n\\n\"True, there\\'s no sign of a wound . . . it\\'s a natural death.\"\\n\\nThey laid the body on the sofa and unfastened the clothes. But red\\nstains at once appeared on the white shirt; and, when they pushed it\\nback, they saw that, near the heart, the chest bore a little scratch\\nthrough which had trickled a thin stream of blood.\\n\\nAnd on the shirt was pinned a card. Gourel bent forward. It was Arsène\\nLupin\\'s card, bloodstained like the rest.\\n\\nThen Gourel drew himself up, authoritatively and sharply:\\n\\n\"Murdered! . . . Arsène Lupin! . . . Leave the flat. . . . Leave the\\nflat, all of you! . . . No one must stay here or in the bedroom. . . .\\nLet the two men be removed and seen to elsewhere! . . . Leave the flat\\n. . . and don\\'t touch a thing . . .\\n\\n\"_The chief is on his way! . . ._\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nTHE BLUE-EDGED LABEL\\n\\n\\n\"Arsène Lupin!\"\\n\\nGourel repeated these two fateful words with an absolutely petrified\\nair. They rang within him like a knell. Arsène Lupin! The great, the\\nformidable Arsène Lupin. The burglar-king, the mighty adventurer! Was it\\npossible?\\n\\n\"No, no,\" he muttered, \"it\\'s not possible, _because he\\'s dead_!\"\\n\\nOnly that was just it . . . was he really dead?\\n\\nArsène Lupin!\\n\\nStanding beside the corpse, he remained dull and stunned, turning the\\ncard over and over with a certain dread, as though he had been\\nchallenged by a ghost. Arsène Lupin! What ought he to do? Act? Take the\\nfield with his resources? No, no . . . better not act . . . . He was\\nbound to make mistakes if he entered the lists with an adversary of that\\nstamp. Besides, the chief was on his way!\\n\\n_The chief was on his way!_ All Gourel\\'s intellectual philosophy was\\nsummed up in that short sentence. An able, persevering officer, full of\\ncourage and experience and endowed with Herculean strength, he was one\\nof those who go ahead only when obeying directions and who do good work\\nonly when ordered. And this lack of initiative had become still more\\nmarked since M. Lenormand had taken the place of M. Dudouis in the\\ndetective-service. M. Lenormand was a chief indeed! With him, one was\\nsure of being on the right track. So sure, even, that Gourel stopped the\\nmoment that the chief\\'s incentive was no longer behind him.\\n\\nBut the chief was on his way! Gourel took out his watch and calculated\\nthe exact time when he would arrive. If only the commissary of police\\ndid not get there first, if only the examining-magistrate, who was no\\ndoubt already appointed, or the divisional surgeon, did not come to make\\ninopportune discoveries before the chief had time to fix the essential\\npoints of the case in his mind!\\n\\n\"Well, Gourel, what are you dreaming about?\"\\n\\n\"The chief!\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand was still a young man, if you took stock only of the\\nexpression of his face and his eyes gleaming through his spectacles; but\\nhe was almost an old man when you saw his bent back, his skin dry and\\nyellow as wax, his grizzled hair and beard, his whole decrepit,\\nhesitating, unhealthy appearance. He had spent his life laboriously in\\nthe colonies as government commissary, in the most dangerous posts. He\\nhad there acquired a series of fevers; an indomitable energy,\\nnotwithstanding his physical weariness; the habit of living alone, of\\ntalking little and acting in silence; a certain misanthropy; and,\\nsuddenly, at the age of fifty-five, in consequence of the famous case of\\nthe three Spaniards at Biskra, a great and well-earned notoriety.\\n\\nThe injustice was then repaired; and he was straightway transferred to\\nBordeaux, was next appointed deputy in Paris, and lastly, on the death\\nof M. Dudouis, chief of the detective-service. And in each of these\\nposts he displayed such a curious faculty of inventiveness in his\\nproceedings, such resourcefulness, so many new and original qualities;\\nand above all, he achieved such correct results in the conduct of the\\nlast four or five cases with which public opinion had been stirred, that\\nhis name was quoted in the same breath with those of the most celebrated\\ndetectives.\\n\\nGourel, for his part, had no hesitation. Himself a favourite of the\\nchief, who liked him for his frankness and his passive obedience, he set\\nthe chief above them all. The chief to him was an idol, an infallible\\ngod.\\n\\nM. Lenormand seemed more tired than usual that day. He sat down wearily,\\nparted the tails of his frock-coat--an old frock-coat, famous for its\\nantiquated cut and its olive-green hue--untied his neckerchief--an\\nequally famous maroon-coloured neckerchief, rested his two hands on his\\nstick, and said:\\n\\n\"Speak!\"\\n\\nGourel told all that he had seen, and all that he had learnt, and told\\nit briefly, according to the habit which the chief had taught him.\\n\\nBut, when he produced Lupin\\'s card, M. Lenormand gave a start:\\n\\n\"Lupin!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Lupin. The brute\\'s bobbed up again.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right, that\\'s all right,\" said M. Lenormand, after a\\nmoment\\'s thought.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right, of course,\" said Gourel, who loved to add a word of\\nhis own to the rare speeches of a superior whose only fault in his eyes\\nwas an undue reticence. \"That\\'s all right, for at last you will measure\\nyour strength with an adversary worthy of you. . . . And Lupin will meet\\nhis master. . . . Lupin will cease to exist. . . . Lupin . . .\"\\n\\n\"Ferret!\" said M. Lenormand, cutting him short.\\n\\nIt was like an order given by a sportsman to his dog. And Gourel\\nferreted after the manner of a good dog, a lively and intelligent\\nanimal, working under his master\\'s eyes. M. Lenormand pointed his stick\\nto a corner, to an easy chair, just as one points to a bush or a tuft of\\ngrass, and Gourel beat up the bush or the tuft of grass with\\nconscientious thoroughness.\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" said the sergeant, when he finished.\\n\\n\"Nothing for you!\" grunted M. Lenormand.\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I meant to say. . . . I know that, for you, chief, there\\nare things that talk like human beings, real living witnesses. For all\\nthat, here is a murder well and duly added to our score against Master\\nLupin.\"\\n\\n\"The first,\" observed M. Lenormand.\\n\\n\"The first, yes. . . . But it was bound to come. You can\\'t lead that\\nsort of life without, sooner or later, being driven by circumstances to\\nserious crime. Mr. Kesselbach must have defended himself. . . .\"\\n\\n\"No, because he was bound.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true,\" owned Gourel, somewhat disconcertedly, \"and it\\'s rather\\ncurious too. . . . Why kill an adversary who has practically ceased to\\nexist? . . . But, no matter, if I had collared him yesterday, when we\\nwere face to face at the hall-door . . .\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand had stepped out on the balcony. Then he went to Mr.\\nKesselbach\\'s bedroom, on the right, and tried the fastenings of the\\nwindows and doors.\\n\\n\"The windows of both rooms were shut when I came in,\" said Gourel.\\n\\n\"Shut, or just pushed to?\"\\n\\n\"No one has touched them since. And they are shut, chief.\"\\n\\nA sound of voices brought them back to the sitting-room. Here they found\\nthe divisional surgeon, engaged in examining the body, and M. Formerie,\\nthe magistrate. M. Formerie exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Arsène Lupin! I am glad that at last a lucky chance has brought me into\\ntouch with that scoundrel again! I\\'ll show the fellow the stuff I\\'m made\\nof! . . . And this time it\\'s a murder! . . . It\\'s a fight between you\\nand me now, Master Lupin!\"\\n\\nM. Formerie had not forgotten the strange adventure of the Princesse de\\nLamballe\\'s diadem, nor the wonderful way in which Lupin had tricked him\\na few years before.[1] The thing had remained famous in the annals of\\nthe law-courts. People still laughed at it; and in M. Formerie it had\\nleft a just feeling of resentment, combined with the longing for a\\nstriking revenge.\\n\\n[Footnote 1: See _Arsène Lupin_. By Edgar Jepson and Maurice Leblanc.\\n(Doubleday, Page & Co.).]\\n\\n\"The nature of the crime is self-evident,\" he declared, with a great air\\nof conviction, \"and we shall have no difficulty in discovering the\\nmotive. So all is well. . . . M. Lenormand, how do you do? . . . I am\\ndelighted to see you. . . .\"\\n\\nM. Formerie was not in the least delighted. On the contrary, M.\\nLenormand\\'s presence did not please him at all, seeing that the chief\\ndetective hardly took the trouble to disguise the contempt in which he\\nheld him. However, the magistrate drew himself up and, in his most\\nsolemn tones:\\n\\n\"So, doctor, you consider that death took place about a dozen hours ago,\\nperhaps more! . . . That, in fact, was my own idea. . . . We are quite\\nagreed. . . . And the instrument of the crime?\"\\n\\n\"A knife with a very thin blade, Monsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction,\"\\nreplied the surgeon. \"Look, the blade has been wiped on the dead man\\'s\\nown handkerchief. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Just so . . . just so . . . you can see the mark. . . . And now let us\\ngo and question Mr. Kesselbach\\'s secretary and man-servant. I have no\\ndoubt that their examination will throw some more light on the case.\"\\n\\nChapman, who together with Edwards, had been moved to his own room, on\\nthe left of the sitting-room, had already recovered from his\\nexperiences. He described in detail the events of the previous day, Mr.\\nKesselbach\\'s restlessness, the expected visit of the Colonel and,\\nlastly, the attack of which they had been the victims.\\n\\n\"Aha!\" cried M. Formerie. \"So there\\'s an accomplice! And you heard his\\nname! . . . Marco, you say? . . . This is very important. When we\\'ve got\\nthe accomplice, we shall be a good deal further advanced. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but we\\'ve not got him,\" M. Lenormand ventured to remark.\\n\\n\"We shall see. . . . One thing at a time. . . . And then, Mr. Chapman,\\nthis Marco went away immediately after M. Gourel had rung the bell?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we heard him go.\"\\n\\n\"And after he went, did you hear nothing else?\"\\n\\n\"Yes . . . from time to time, but vaguely. . . . The door was shut.\"\\n\\n\"And what sort of noises did you hear?\"\\n\\n\"Bursts of voices. The man . . .\"\\n\\n\"Call him by his name, Arsène Lupin.\"\\n\\n\"Arsène Lupin must have telephoned.\"\\n\\n\"Capital! We will examine the person of the hotel who has charge of the\\nbranch exchange communicating with the outside. And, afterward, did you\\nhear him go out, too?\"\\n\\n\"He came in to see if we were still bound; and, a quarter of an hour\\nlater, he went away, closing the hall-door after him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, as soon as his crime was committed. Good. . . . Good. . . . It all\\nfits in. . . . And, after that?\"\\n\\n\"After that, we heard nothing more. . . . The night passed. . . . I fell\\nasleep from exhaustion. . . . So did Edwards. . . . And it was not until\\nthis morning . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know. . . . There, it\\'s not going badly . . . it all fits in.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nAnd, marking off the stages of his investigation, in a tone as though he\\nwere enumerating so many victories over the stranger, he muttered\\nthoughtfully:\\n\\n\"The accomplice . . . the telephone . . . the time of the murder . . .\\nthe sounds that were heard. . . . Good. . . . Very good. . . . We have\\nstill to establish the motive of the crime. . . . In this case, as we\\nhave Lupin to deal with, the motive is obvious. M. Lenormand, have you\\nnoticed the least sign of anything being broken open?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Then the robbery must have been effected upon the person of the victim\\nhimself. Has his pocket-book been found?\"\\n\\n\"I left it in the pocket of his jacket,\" said Gourel.\\n\\nThey all went into the sitting-room, where M. Formerie discovered that\\nthe pocket-book contained nothing but visiting-cards and papers\\nestablishing the murdered man\\'s identity.\\n\\n\"That\\'s odd. Mr. Chapman, can you tell us if Mr. Kesselbach had any\\nmoney on him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. On the previous day--that is, on Monday, the day before\\nyesterday--we went to the Crédit Lyonnais, where Mr. Kesselbach hired a\\nsafe . . .\"\\n\\n\"A safe at the Crédit Lyonnais? Good. . . . We must look into that.\"\\n\\n\"And, before we left, Mr. Kesselbach opened an account and drew out five\\nor six thousand francs in bank-notes.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent . . . that tells us just what we want to know.\"\\n\\nChapman continued:\\n\\n\"There is another point, Monsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction. Mr. Kesselbach,\\nwho for some days had been very uneasy in his mind--I have told you the\\nreason: a scheme to which he attached the utmost importance--Mr.\\nKesselbach seemed particularly anxious about two things. There was,\\nfirst, a little ebony box, which he put away safely at the Crédit\\nLyonnais; and, next, a little black morocco note-case, in which he kept\\na few papers.\"\\n\\n\"And where is that?\"\\n\\n\"Before Lupin\\'s arrival, he put it, in my presence, into that\\ntravelling-bag.\"\\n\\nM. Formerie took the bag and felt about in it. The note-case was not\\nthere. He rubbed his hands:\\n\\n\"Ah, everything fits in! . . . We know the culprit, the conditions and\\nthe motive of the crime. This case won\\'t take long. Are we quite agreed\\nupon everything, M. Lenormand?\"\\n\\n\"Upon not one single thing.\"\\n\\nThere was a moment of stupefaction. The commissary of police had\\narrived: and, behind him, in spite of the constables keeping the door,\\na troop of journalists, and the hotel staff had forced their way in and\\nwere standing in the entrance-lobby.\\n\\nNotorious though the old fellow was for his bluntness--a bluntness which\\nwas not without a certain discourtesy and which had already procured him\\nan occasional reprimand in high quarters--the abruptness of this reply\\ntook every one aback. And M. Formerie in particular appeared utterly\\nnonplussed:\\n\\n\"Still,\" he said, \"I can see nothing that isn\\'t quite simple. Lupin is\\nthe thief. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Why did he commit the murder?\" M. Lenormand flung at him.\\n\\n\"In order to commit the theft.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon; the witnesses\\' story proves that the theft took\\nplace before the murder. Mr. Kesselbach was first bound and gagged, then\\nrobbed. Why should Lupin, who has never resorted to murder, choose this\\ntime to kill a man whom he had rendered helpless and whom he had already\\nrobbed?\"\\n\\nThe examining-magistrate stroked his long, fair whiskers, with the\\ngesture customary to him when a question seemed incapable of solution.\\nHe replied in a thoughtful tone:\\n\\n\"There are several answers to that. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What are they?\"\\n\\n\"It depends . . . it depends upon a number of facts as yet unknown.\\n. . . And, moreover, the objection applies only to the nature of the\\nmotives. We are agreed as to the remainder.\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\nThis time, again, the denial was flat, blunt, almost impolite; so much\\nso that the magistrate was absolutely nonplussed, dared not even raise\\na protest, and remained abashed in the presence of this strange\\ncollaborator. At last he said:\\n\\n\"We all have our theories. I should like to know yours.\"\\n\\n\"I have none.\"\\n\\nThe chief detective rose and, leaning on his stick, took a few steps\\nthrough the room. All the people around him were silent. . . . And it\\nwas rather curious, in a group in which, after all, his position was\\nonly that of an auxiliary, a subordinate, to see this ailing, decrepit,\\nelderly man dominate the others by the sheer force of an authority which\\nthey had to feel, even though they did not accept it. After a long pause\\nhe said:\\n\\n\"I should like to inspect the rooms which adjoin this suite.\"\\n\\nThe manager showed him the plan of the hotel. The only way out of the\\nright-hand bedroom, which was Mr. Kesselbach\\'s, was through the little\\nentrance-hall of the suite. But the bedroom on the left, the room\\noccupied by the secretary, communicated with another apartment.\\n\\n\"Let us inspect it,\" said M. Lenormand.\\n\\nM. Formerie could not help shrugging his shoulders and growling:\\n\\n\"But the communicating door is bolted and the window locked.\"\\n\\n\"Let us inspect it,\" repeated M. Lenormand.\\n\\nHe was taken into the apartment, which was the first of the five rooms\\nreserved for Mrs. Kesselbach. Then, at his request, he was taken to the\\nrooms leading out of it. All the communicating doors were bolted on both\\nsides.\\n\\n\"Are not any of these rooms occupied?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Where are the keys?\"\\n\\n\"The keys are always kept in the office.\"\\n\\n\"Then no one can have got in? . . .\"\\n\\n\"No one, except the floor-waiter who airs and dusts the rooms.\"\\n\\n\"Send for him, please.\"\\n\\nThe man, whose name was Gustave Beudot, replied that he had closed the\\nwindows of five rooms on the previous day in accordance with his general\\ninstructions.\\n\\n\"At what time?\"\\n\\n\"At six o\\'clock in the evening.\"\\n\\n\"And you noticed nothing?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"And, this morning . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"This morning, I opened the windows at eight o\\'clock exactly.\"\\n\\n\"And you found nothing?\"\\n\\nHe hesitated. He was pressed with questions and ended by admitting:\\n\\n\"Well, I picked up a cigarette-case near the fireplace in 420. . . . I\\nintended to take it to the office this evening.\"\\n\\n\"Have you it on you?\"\\n\\n\"No, it is in my room. It is a gun-metal case. It has a space for\\ntobacco and cigarette-papers on one side and for matches on the other.\\nThere are two initials in gold: an L and an M. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\nChapman had stepped forward. He seemed greatly surprised and,\\nquestioning the servant:\\n\\n\"A gun-metal cigarette-case, you say?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"With three compartments--for tobacco, cigarette-papers, and matches.\\n. . . Russian tobacco, wasn\\'t it, very fine and light?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Go and fetch it. . . . I should like to see it for myself . . . to make\\nsure. . . .\"\\n\\nAt a sign from the chief detective, Gustave Beudot left the room.\\n\\nM. Lenormand sat down and his keen eyes examined the carpet, the\\nfurniture and the curtains. He asked:\\n\\n\"This is room 420, is it not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nThe magistrate grinned:\\n\\n\"I should very much like to know what connection you establish between\\nthis incident and the tragedy. Five locked doors separate us from the\\nroom in which Mr. Kesselbach was murdered.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand did not condescend to reply.\\n\\nTime passed. Gustave did not return.\\n\\n\"Where does he sleep?\" asked the chief detective.\\n\\n\"On the sixth floor,\" answered the manager. \"The room is on the Rue de\\nJudée side: above this, therefore. It\\'s curious that he\\'s not back yet.\"\\n\\n\"Would you have the kindness to send some one to see?\"\\n\\nThe manager went himself, accompanied by Chapman. A few minutes after,\\nhe returned alone, running, with every mark of consternation on his\\nface.\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"Dead!\"\\n\\n\"Murdered?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, by thunder, how clever these scoundrels are!\" roared M. Lenormand,\\n\"Off with you, Gourel, and have the doors of the hotel locked. . . .\\nWatch every outlet. . . . And you, Mr. Manager, please take us to\\nGustave Beudot\\'s room.\"\\n\\nThe manager led the way. But as they left the room, M. Lenormand stooped\\nand picked up a tiny little round piece of paper, on which his eyes had\\nalready fixed themselves.\\n\\nIt was a label surrounded with a blue border and marked with the number\\n813. He put it in his pocket, on chance, and joined the others. . . .\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nA small wound in the back, between the shoulder-blades. . . .\\n\\n\"Exactly the same wound as Mr. Kesselbach\\'s,\" declared the doctor.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said M. Lenormand, \"it was the same hand that struck the blow and\\nthe same weapon was used.\"\\n\\nJudging by the position of the body, the man had been surprised when on\\nhis knees before the bed, feeling under the mattress for the\\ncigarette-case which he had hidden there. His arm was still caught\\nbetween the mattress and the bed, but the cigarette-case was not to be\\nfound.\\n\\n\"That cigarette-case must have been devilish compromising!\" timidly\\nsuggested M. Formerie, who no longer dared put forward any definite\\nopinion.\\n\\n\"Well, of course!\" said the chief detective.\\n\\n\"At any rate, we know the initials: an L and an M. And with that,\\ntogether with what Mr. Chapman appears to know, we shall easily learn.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand gave a start:\\n\\n\"Chapman! But where is he?\"\\n\\nThey looked in the passage among the groups of people crowded together.\\nChapman was not there.\\n\\n\"Mr. Chapman came with me,\" said the manager.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I know, but he did not come back with you.\"\\n\\n\"No, I left him with the corpse.\"\\n\\n\"You left him! . . . Alone?\"\\n\\n\"I said to him, \\'Stay here . . . don\\'t move.\\'\"\\n\\n\"And was there no one about? Did you see no one?\"\\n\\n\"In the passage? No.\"\\n\\n\"But in the other attics? . . . Or else, look here, round that corner:\\nwas there no one hiding there?\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand seemed greatly excited. He walked up and down, he opened\\nthe doors of the rooms. And, suddenly, he set off at a run, with an\\nagility of which no one would have thought him capable. He rattled down\\nthe six storeys, followed at a distance by the manager and the\\nexamining-magistrate. At the bottom, he found Gourel in front of the\\nmain door.\\n\\n\"Has no one gone out?\"\\n\\n\"No, chief.\"\\n\\n\"What about the other door, in the Rue Orvieto?\"\\n\\n\"I have posted Dieuzy there.\"\\n\\n\"With firm orders?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, chief.\"\\n\\nThe huge hall of the hotel was crowded with anxious visitors, all\\ncommenting on the more or less accurate versions that had reached them\\nof the crime. All the servants had been summoned by telephone and were\\narriving, one by one. M. Lenormand questioned them without delay. None\\nof them was able to supply the least information. But a fifth-floor\\nchambermaid appeared. Ten minutes earlier, or thereabouts, she had\\npassed two gentlemen who were coming down the servants\\' staircase\\nbetween the fifth and the fourth floors.\\n\\n\"They came down very fast. The one in front was holding the other by the\\nhand. I was surprised to see those two gentlemen on the servants\\'\\nstaircase.\"\\n\\n\"Would you know them again?\"\\n\\n\"Not the first one. He had his head turned the other way. He was a thin,\\nfair man. He wore a soft black hat . . . and black clothes.\"\\n\\n\"And the other?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, the other was an Englishman, with a big, clean-shaven face and a\\ncheck suit. He had no hat on.\"\\n\\nThe description obviously referred to Chapman.\\n\\nThe woman added:\\n\\n\"He looked . . . he looked quite funny . . . as if he was mad.\"\\n\\nGourel\\'s word was not enough for M. Lenormand. One after the other, he\\nquestioned the under-porters standing at the two doors:\\n\\n\"Did you know Mr. Chapman?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, he always spoke to us.\"\\n\\n\"And you have not seen him go out?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir. He has not been out this morning.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand turned to the commissary of police: \"How many men have you\\nwith you, Monsieur le Commissaire?\"\\n\\n\"Four.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not sufficient. Telephone to your secretary to send you all the\\nmen available. And please be so good as yourself to organize the closest\\nwatch at every outlet. The state of siege, Monsieur le Commissaire.\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"But I say,\" protested the manager, \"my customers?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care a hang, sir, for your customers! My duty comes before\\neverything; and my duty is at all costs to arrest. . . .\"\\n\\n\"So you believe . . .\" the examining-magistrate ventured to interpolate.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t _believe_, monsieur . . . I am sure that the perpetrator of\\nboth the murders is still in the hotel.\"\\n\\n\"But then Chapman . . .\"\\n\\n\"At this moment, I cannot guarantee that Chapman is still alive. In any\\ncase, it is only a question of minutes, of seconds. . . . Gourel, take\\ntwo men and search all the rooms on the fourth floor. . . . Mr. Manager,\\nsend one of your clerks with them. . . . As for the other floors, I\\nshall proceed as soon as we are reënforced. Come, Gourel, off with you,\\nand keep your eyes open. . . . It\\'s big game you\\'re hunting!\"\\n\\nGourel and his men hurried away. M. Lenormand himself remained in the\\nhall, near the office. This time, he did not think of sitting down, as\\nhis custom was. He walked from the main entrance to the door in the Rue\\nOrvieto and returned to the point from which he had started. At\\nintervals he gave instructions:\\n\\n\"Mr. Manager, see that the kitchens are watched. They may try to escape\\nthat way. . . . Mr. Manager, instruct your young lady at the telephone\\nnot to put any of the people in the hotel into communication with\\noutside subscribers. If a call comes from the outside, she can connect\\nthe caller with the person asked for, but she must take a note of that\\nperson\\'s name. . . . Mr. Manager, have a list made out of all your\\nvisitors whose name begins with an L or an M.\"\\n\\nThe tension caught the spectators by the throat, as they stood\\nclustered in the middle of the hall, silent and gasping for breath,\\nshaking with fear at the least sound, obsessed by the infernal image of\\nthe murderer. Where was he hiding? Would he show himself? Was he not one\\nof themselves: this one, perhaps . . . or that one? . . .\\n\\nAnd all eyes were turned on the gray-haired gentleman in spectacles, an\\nolive-green frock-coat and a maroon-colored neckerchief, who was walking\\nabout, with his bent back, on a pair of shaky legs.\\n\\nAt times, one of the waiters accompanying Sergeant Gourel on his search\\nwould come running up.\\n\\n\"Any news?\" asked M. Lenormand.\\n\\n\"No, sir, we\\'ve found nothing.\"\\n\\nThe manager made two attempts to induce him to relax his orders\\nregarding the doors. The situation was becoming intolerable. The office\\nwas filled with loudly-protesting visitors, who had business outside, or\\nwho had arranged to leave Paris.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care a hang!\" said M. Lenormand again.\\n\\n\"But I know them all.\"\\n\\n\"I congratulate you.\"\\n\\n\"You are exceeding your powers.\"\\n\\n\"I know.\"\\n\\n\"The law will decide against you.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m convinced of that.\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction himself. . . .\"\\n\\n\"M. Formerie had better not interfere. He can mind his own business,\\nwhich is to examine the servants, as he is doing now. Besides, it has\\nnothing to do with the examining-magistrate, it has to do with the\\npolice. It\\'s my affair.\"\\n\\nJust then a squad of police burst into the hotel. The chief detective\\ndivided them into several sections which he sent up to the third floor.\\nThen, addressing the commissary of police:\\n\\n\"My dear commissary, I leave the task of watching the doors to you. No\\nweakness, I entreat you. I will take the responsibility for anything\\nthat happens.\"\\n\\nAnd, turning to the lift, he had himself conveyed to the second floor.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIt was a difficult business and a long one, for they had to open the\\ndoors of the sixty bedrooms, to inspect all the bathrooms, all the\\nrecesses, all the cupboards, every nook and corner.\\n\\nAnd it was also fruitless. An hour later, on the stroke of twelve, M.\\nLenormand had just done the second floor; the other parties had not yet\\nfinished the upper floors; and no discovery had been made.\\n\\nM. Lenormand hesitated: had the murderer retreated to the attics?\\n\\nHe was deciding, however, to go downstairs, when he was told that Mrs.\\nKesselbach had just arrived with her lady-companion. Edwards, the old\\nconfidential man-servant, had accepted the task of informing her of Mr.\\nKesselbach\\'s death.\\n\\nM. Lenormand found her in one of the drawing rooms, overcome by the\\nunexpected shock, dry-eyed, but with her features wrung with grief and\\nher body trembling all over, as though convulsed with fever. She was a\\nrather tall, dark woman; and her black and exceedingly beautiful eyes\\nwere filled with gold, with little gold spots, like spangles gleaming in\\nthe dark. Her husband had met her in Holland, where Dolores was born of\\nan old family of Spanish origin, the Amontis. He fell in love with her\\nat first sight; and for four years the harmony between them, built up\\nof mutual affection and devotion, had never been interrupted.\\n\\nM. Lenormand introduced himself. She looked at him without replying; and\\nhe was silent, for she did not appear, in her stupor, to understand what\\nhe said. Then, suddenly, she began to shed copious tears and asked to be\\ntaken to her husband.\\n\\nIn the hall, M. Lenormand found Gourel, who was looking for him and who\\nrushed at him with a hat which he held in his hand:\\n\\n\"I picked this up, chief. . . . There\\'s no doubt whom it belongs to, is\\nthere?\"\\n\\nIt was a soft, black felt hat and resembled the description given. There\\nwas no lining or label inside it.\\n\\n\"Where did you pick it up?\"\\n\\n\"On the second-floor landing of the servants\\' staircase.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing on the other floors?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing. We\\'ve searched everywhere. There is only the first floor left.\\nAnd this hat shows that the man went down so far. We\\'re burning, chief!\"\\n\\n\"I think so.\"\\n\\nAt the foot of the stairs M. Lenormand stopped:\\n\\n\"Go back to the commissary and give him my orders: he must post two men\\nat the foot of each of the four staircases, revolver in hand. And they\\nare to fire, if necessary. Understand this, Gourel: if Chapman is not\\nsaved and if the fellow escapes, it means my resignation. I\\'ve been\\nwool-gathering for over two hours.\"\\n\\nHe went up the stairs. On the first floor he met two policemen leaving a\\nbedroom, accompanied by a servant of the hotel.\\n\\nThe passage was deserted. The hotel staff dared not venture into it.\\nSome of the permanent visitors had locked themselves in their rooms; and\\nthe police had to knock for a long time and proclaim who they were\\nbefore they could get the doors opened.\\n\\nFarther on, M. Lenormand saw another group of policemen searching the\\nmaid\\'s pantry and, at the end of a long passage, he saw some more men\\nwho were approaching the turning, that is to say, that part of the\\npassage which contained the rooms overlooking the Rue de Judée.\\n\\nAnd, suddenly, he heard these men shouting; and they disappeared at a\\nrun.\\n\\nHe hurried after them.\\n\\nThe policemen had stopped in the middle of the passage. At their feet,\\nblocking their way, with its face on the carpet, lay a corpse.\\n\\nM. Lenormand bent down and took the lifeless head in his hands:\\n\\n\"Chapman,\" he muttered. \"He is dead.\"\\n\\nHe examined the body. A white knitted silk muffler was tied round the\\nneck. He undid it. Red stains appeared; and he saw that the muffler held\\na thick wad of cotton-wool in position against the nape of the neck. The\\nwad was soaked with blood.\\n\\nOnce again there was the same little wound, clean, frank and pitiless.\\n\\nM. Formerie and the commissary were at once told and came hastening up.\\n\\n\"No one gone out?\" asked the chief detective. \"No surprise?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the commissary. \"There are two men on guard at the foot of\\neach staircase.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps he has gone up again?\" said M. Formerie.\\n\\n\"No! . . . No! . . .\"\\n\\n\"But some one must have met him. . . .\"\\n\\n\"No. . . . This all happened quite a long time ago. The hands are cold.\\n. . . The murder must have been committed almost immediately after the\\nother . . . as soon as the two men came here by the servants\\'\\nstaircase.\"\\n\\n\"But the body would have been seen! Think, fifty people must have passed\\nthis spot during the last two hours. . . .\"\\n\\n\"The body was not here.\"\\n\\n\"Then where was it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, how can I tell?\" snapped the chief detective. \"Do as I\\'m doing,\\nlook for yourself! You can\\'t find things by talking.\"\\n\\nHe furiously patted the knob of his stick with a twitching hand; and he\\nstood there, with his eyes fixed on the body, silent and thoughtful. At\\nlast he spoke:\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Commissaire, be so good as to have the victim taken to an\\nempty room. Let them fetch the doctor. Mr. Manager, would you mind\\nopening the doors of all the rooms on this passage for me?\"\\n\\nOn the left were three bedrooms and two sitting-rooms, forming an empty\\nsuite, which M. Lenormand inspected. On the right were four bedrooms.\\nTwo were occupied respectively by a M. Reverdat and an Italian, Baron\\nGiacomini, who were both then out. In the third room they found an\\nelderly English maiden lady still in bed; and, in the fourth, an\\nEnglishman who was placidly reading and smoking and who had not been in\\nthe least disturbed by the noises in the passage. His name was Major\\nParbury.\\n\\nNo amount of searching or questioning led to any result. The old maid\\nhad heard nothing before the exclamations of the policeman: no noise of\\na struggle, no cry of pain, no sound of quarreling; and Major Parbury\\nneither.\\n\\nMoreover, there was no suspicious clue found, no trace of blood, nothing\\nto lead them to suppose that the unfortunate Chapman had been in one of\\nthose rooms.\\n\\n\"It\\'s queer,\" muttered the examining-magistrate, \"it\\'s all very queer.\\n. . .\" And he confessed, ingenuously, \"I feel more and more at sea.\\n. . . There is a whole series of circumstances that are partly beyond\\nme. What do you make of it, M. Lenormand?\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand was on the point of letting off one of those pointed\\nrejoinders in which he was wont to give vent to his chronic ill-temper,\\nwhen Gourel appeared upon the scene, all out of breath.\\n\\n\"Chief,\" he panted, \"they\\'ve found this . . . downstairs . . . in the\\noffice . . . on a chair. . . .\"\\n\\nIt was a parcel of moderate dimensions, wrapped up in a piece of black\\nserge.\\n\\n\"Did they open it?\" asked the chief.\\n\\n\"Yes, but when they saw what the parcel contained, they did it up again\\nexactly as it was . . . fastened very tight, as you can see. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Untie it.\"\\n\\nGourel removed the wrapper and disclosed a black diagonal jacket and\\ntrousers, which had evidently been packed up in a hurry, as the creases\\nin the cloth showed. In the middle was a towel, covered with blood,\\nwhich had been dipped in water, in order, no doubt, to destroy the marks\\nof the hands that had been wiped on it. Inside the napkin was a steel\\ndagger, with a handle encrusted with gold. This also was red with blood,\\nthe blood of three men stabbed within the space of a few hours by an\\ninvisible hand, amid the crowd of three hundred people moving about in\\nthe huge hotel.\\n\\nEdwards, the man-servant, at once identified the dagger as belonging to\\nMr. Kesselbach. He had seen it on the table on the previous day, before\\nthe assault committed by Lupin.\\n\\n\"Mr. Manager,\" said the chief detective, \"the restriction is over.\\nGourel, go and give orders to leave the doors free.\"\\n\\n\"So you think that Lupin has succeeded in getting out?\" asked M.\\nFormerie.\\n\\n\"No. The perpetrator of the three murders which we have discovered is in\\none of the rooms of the hotel, or, rather, he is among the visitors in\\nthe hall or in the reception-rooms. In my opinion, he was staying in the\\nhotel.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible! Besides, where would he have changed his clothes? And what\\nclothes would he have on now?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, but I am stating a fact.\"\\n\\n\"And you are letting him go? Why, he\\'ll just walk out quietly, with his\\nhands in his pockets!\"\\n\\n\"The one who walks away like that, without his luggage, and who does not\\nreturn, will be the criminal. Mr. Manager, please come with me to the\\noffice. I should like to make a close inspection of your visitors\\'\\nbook.\"\\n\\nIn the office, M. Lenormand found a few letters addressed to Mr.\\nKesselbach. He handed them to the examining-magistrate. There was also a\\nparcel that had just come by the Paris parcel-post. The paper in which\\nit was packed was partly torn; and M. Lenormand saw that it held a small\\nebony box, engraved with the name of Rudolf Kesselbach. Feeling\\ncurious, he opened the parcel. The box contained the fragments of a\\nlooking-glass which had evidently been fixed to the inside of the lid.\\nIt also contained the card of Arsène Lupin.\\n\\nBut one detail seemed to strike the chief detective. On the outside, at\\nthe bottom of the box, was a little blue-edged label, similar to the\\nlabel which he had picked up in the room on the fourth floor where the\\ncigarette-case was found, and this label bore the same number, 813.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nM. LENORMAND OPENS HIS CAMPAIGN\\n\\n\\n\"Auguste, show M. Lenormand in.\"\\n\\nThe messenger went out and, a few seconds later, announced the chief of\\nthe detective-service.\\n\\nThere were three men in the prime minister\\'s private room on the Place\\nBeauvau: the famous Valenglay, leader of the radical party for the past\\nthirty years and now president of the council and minister of the\\ninterior; the attorney-general, M. Testard; and the prefect of police,\\nDelaume.\\n\\nThe prefect of police and the attorney-general did not rise from the\\nchairs which they had occupied during their long conversation with the\\nprime minister. Valenglay, however, stood up and, pressing the chief\\ndetective\\'s hand, said, in the most cordial tones:\\n\\n\"I have no doubt, my dear Lenormand, that you know the reason why I\\nasked you to come.\"\\n\\n\"The Kesselbach case?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe Kesselbach case! Not one of us but is able to recall not only the\\nmain details of this tragic affair, the tangled skein of which I have\\nset myself to unravel, but even its very smallest incidents, so greatly\\ndid the tragedy excite us all during these recent years. Nor is there\\none of us but remembers the extraordinary stir which it created both in\\nand outside France. And yet there was one thing that upset the public\\neven more than the three murders committed in such mysterious\\ncircumstances, more than the detestable atrocity of that butchery, more\\nthan anything else; and that was the reappearance--one might almost say\\nthe resurrection--of Arsène Lupin.\\n\\nArsène Lupin! No one had heard speak of him for over four years, since\\nhis incredible, his astounding adventure of the Hollow Needle,[2] since\\nthe day when he had slunk away into the darkness before the eyes of\\nHolmlock Shears and Isidore Beautrelet, carrying on his back the dead\\nbody of the woman whom he loved, and followed by his old servant,\\nVictoire.\\n\\n[Footnote 2: See _The Hollow Needle_. By Maurice Leblanc. Translated by\\nAlexander Teixeira de Mattos and published by Doubleday, Page & Co.]\\n\\nFrom that day onward he had been generally believed to be dead. This was\\nthe version put about by the police, who, finding no trace of their\\nadversary, were content purely and simply to bury him.\\n\\nSome, however, believing him to be saved, described him as leading a\\nplacid, Philistine existence. According to them, he was living with his\\nwife and children, growing his small potatoes; whereas others maintained\\nthat, bent down with the weight of sorrow and weary of the vanities of\\nthis world, he had sought the seclusion of a Trappist monastery.\\n\\nAnd here he was once more looming large in the public view and resuming\\nhis relentless struggle against society! Arsène Lupin was Arsène Lupin\\nagain, the fanciful, intangible, disconcerting, audacious, genial Arsène\\nLupin! But, this time, a cry of horror arose. Arsène Lupin had taken\\nhuman life! And the fierceness, the cruelty, the ruthless cynicism of\\nthe crime were so great that, then and there, the legend of the popular\\nhero, of the chivalrous and occasionally sentimental adventurer, made\\nway for a new conception of an inhuman, bloodthirsty, and ferocious\\nmonster. The crowd now loathed and feared its former idol with more\\nintensity than it had once shown in admiring him for his easy grace and\\nhis diverting good-humor.\\n\\nAnd, forthwith, the indignation of that frightened crowd turned against\\nthe police. Formerly, people had laughed. They forgave the beaten\\ncommissary of police for the comical fashion in which he allowed himself\\nto be beaten. But the joke had lasted too long; and, in a burst of\\nrevolt and fury, they now called the authorities to account for the\\nunspeakable crimes which these were powerless to prevent.\\n\\nIn the press, at public meetings, in the streets and even in the tribune\\nof the Chamber of Deputies there was such an explosion of wrath that the\\ngovernment grew alarmed and strove by every possible means to allay the\\npublic excitement.\\n\\nIt so happened that Valenglay, the premier, took a great interest in all\\nthese police questions and had often amused himself by going closely\\ninto different cases with the chief of the detective-service, whose good\\nqualities and independent character he valued highly. He sent for the\\nprefect and the attorney-general to see him in his room, talked to them\\nand then sent for M. Lenormand.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear Lenormand, it\\'s about the Kesselbach case. But, before we\\ndiscuss it, I must call your attention to a point which more\\nparticularly affects and, I may say, annoys Monsieur le Préfet de\\nPolice. M. Delaume, will you explain to M. Lenormand . . . ?\\n\\n\"Oh, M. Lenormand knows quite well how the matter stands,\" said the\\nprefect, in a tone which showed but little good-will toward his\\nsubordinate. \"We have talked it over already and I have told him what I\\nthought of his improper conduct at the Palace Hotel. People are\\ngenerally indignant.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand rose, took a paper from his pocket and laid it on the\\ntable.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" asked Valenglay.\\n\\n\"My resignation, Monsieur le Président du Conseil.\"\\n\\nValenglay gave a jump:\\n\\n\"What! Your resignation! For a well-meaning remark which Monsieur le\\nPréfet thinks fit to address to you and to which, for that matter, he\\nattaches no importance whatever--do you, Delaume? No importance\\nwhatever--and there you go, taking offence! You must confess, my dear\\nLenormand, that you\\'re devilish touchy! Come, put that bit of paper back\\nin your pocket and let\\'s talk seriously.\"\\n\\nThe chief detective sat down again, and Valenglay, silencing the\\nprefect, who made no attempt to conceal his dissatisfaction, said:\\n\\n\"In two words, Lenormand, the thing is that Lupin\\'s reappearance upon\\nthe scene annoys us. The brute has defied us long enough. It used to be\\nfunny, I confess, and I, for my part, was the first to laugh at it. But\\nit\\'s no longer a question of that. It\\'s a question of murder now. We\\ncould stand Lupin, as long as he amused the gallery. But, when he takes\\nto killing people, no!\"\\n\\n\"Then what is it that you ask, Monsieur le Président?\"\\n\\n\"What we ask? Oh, it\\'s quite simple! First, his arrest and then his\\nhead!\"\\n\\n\"I can promise you his arrest, some day or another, but not his head.\"\\n\\n\"What! If he\\'s arrested, it means trial for murder, a verdict of guilty,\\nand the scaffold.\"\\n\\n\"No!\"\\n\\n\"And why not?\"\\n\\n\"Because Lupin has not committed murder.\"\\n\\n\"Eh? Why, you\\'re mad, Lenormand! The corpses at the Palace Hotel are so\\nmany inventions, I suppose! And the three murders were never committed!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but not by Lupin.\"\\n\\nThe chief spoke these words very steadily, with impressive calmness and\\nconviction. The attorney and the prefect protested.\\n\\n\"I presume, Lenormand,\" said Valenglay, \"that you do not put forward\\nthat theory without serious reasons?\"\\n\\n\"It is not a theory.\"\\n\\n\"What proof have you?\"\\n\\n\"There are two, to begin with, two proofs of a moral nature, which I at\\nonce placed before Monsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction and which the\\nnewspapers have laid stress upon. First and foremost, Lupin does not\\nkill people. Next, why should he have killed anybody, seeing that the\\nobject which he set out to achieve, the theft, was accomplished and that\\nhe had nothing to fear from an adversary who was gagged and bound?\"\\n\\n\"Very well. But the facts?\"\\n\\n\"Facts are worth nothing against reason and logic; and, moreover, the\\nfacts also are on my side. What would be the meaning of Lupin\\'s presence\\nin the room in which the cigarette-case was discovered? On the other\\nhand, the black clothes which were found and which evidently belonged to\\nthe murderer are not in the least of a size to fit Lupin.\"\\n\\n\"You know him, then, do you?\"\\n\\n\"I? No. But Edwards saw him, Gourel saw him; and the man whom they saw\\nis not the man whom the chambermaid saw, on the servants\\' staircase,\\ndragging Chapman by the hand.\"\\n\\n\"Then your idea . . .\"\\n\\n\"You mean to say, the truth, M. le Président. Here it is, or, at least,\\nhere is the truth as far as I know it. On Tuesday, the 16th of April, a\\nman---Lupin--broke into Mr. Kesselbach\\'s room at about two o\\'clock in\\nthe afternoon. . . .\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand was interrupted by a burst of laughter. It came from the\\nprefect of police.\\n\\n\"Let me tell you, M. Lenormand, that you are in rather too great a hurry\\nto state your precise facts. It has been shown that, at three o\\'clock on\\nthat day, Mr. Kesselbach walked into the Crédit Lyonnais and went down\\nto the safe deposit. His signature in the register proves it.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand waited respectfully until his superior had finished\\nspeaking. Then, without even troubling to reply directly to the attack,\\nhe continued:\\n\\n\"At about two o\\'clock in the afternoon, Lupin, assisted by an\\naccomplice, a man named Marco, bound Mr. Kesselbach hand and foot,\\nrobbed him of all the loose cash which he had upon him and compelled him\\nto reveal the cypher of his safe at the Crédit Lyonnais. As soon as the\\nsecret was told, Marco left. He joined another accomplice, who,\\nprofiting by a certain resemblance to Mr. Kesselbach--a resemblance\\nwhich he accentuated that day by wearing clothes similar to Mr.\\nKesselbach\\'s and putting on a pair of gold spectacles--entered the\\nCrédit Lyonnais, imitated Mr. Kesselbach\\'s signature, emptied the safe\\nof its contents and walked off, accompanied by Marco. Marco at once\\ntelephoned to Lupin. Lupin, as soon as he was sure that Mr. Kesselbach\\nhad not deceived him and that the object of his expedition was attained,\\nwent away.\"\\n\\nValenglay seemed to waver in his mind:\\n\\n\"Yes, yes . . . we\\'ll admit that. . . . But what surprises me is that a\\nman like Lupin should have risked so much for such a paltry profit: a\\nfew bank-notes and the hypothetical contents of a safe.\"\\n\\n\"Lupin was after more than that. He wanted either the morocco envelope\\nwhich was in the traveling-bag, or else the ebony box which was in the\\nsafe. He had the ebony box, because he has sent it back empty.\\nTherefore, by this time, he knows, or is in a fair way for knowing, the\\nfamous scheme which Mr. Kesselbach was planning, and which he was\\ndiscussing with his secretary a few minutes before his death.\"\\n\\n\"What was the scheme?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t exactly know. The manager of Barbareux\\'s agency, to whom he had\\nopened his mind about it, has told me that Mr. Kesselbach was looking\\nfor a man who went by the name of Pierre Leduc, a man who had lost\\ncaste, it appears. Why and how the discovery of this person was\\nconnected with the success of his scheme, I am unable to say.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Valenglay. \"So much for Arsène Lupin. His part is\\nplayed. Mr. Kesselbach is bound hand and foot, robbed, but alive! . . .\\nWhat happens up to the time when he is found dead?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, for several hours, nothing until night. But, during the night,\\nsome one made his way in.\"\\n\\n\"How?\"\\n\\n\"Through room 420, one of the rooms reserved by Mr. Kesselbach. The\\nperson in question evidently possessed a false key.\"\\n\\n\"But,\" exclaimed the prefect of police, \"all the doors between that room\\nand Mr. Kesselbach\\'s flat were bolted; and there were five of them!\"\\n\\n\"There was always the balcony.\"\\n\\n\"The balcony!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; the balcony runs along the whole floor, on the Rue de Judée side.\"\\n\\n\"And what about the spaces in between?\"\\n\\n\"An active man can step across them. Our man did. I have found marks.\"\\n\\n\"But all the windows of the suite were shut; and it was ascertained,\\nafter the crime, that they were still shut.\"\\n\\n\"All except one, the secretary\\'s window, Chapman\\'s, which was only\\npushed to. I tried it myself.\"\\n\\nThis time the prime minister seemed a little shaken, so logical did M.\\nLenormand\\'s version seem, so precise and supported by such sound facts.\\nHe asked, with growing interest:\\n\\n\"But what was the man\\'s object in coming?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you don\\'t know!\"\\n\\n\"Any more than I know his name.\"\\n\\n\"But why did he kill Mr. Kesselbach?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. This all remains a mystery. The utmost that we have the\\nright to suppose is that he did not come with the intention of killing,\\nbut with the intention, he too, of taking the documents contained in\\nthe morocco note-case and the ebony box; and that, finding himself by\\naccident in the presence of the enemy reduced to a state of\\nhelplessness, he killed him.\"\\n\\nValenglay muttered:\\n\\n\"Yes, strictly speaking, that is possible. . . . And, according to you,\\ndid he find the documents?\"\\n\\n\"He did not find the box, because it was not there; but he found the\\nblack morocco note-case. So that Lupin and . . . the other are in the\\nsame position. Each knows as much as the other about the Kesselbach\\nscheme.\"\\n\\n\"That means,\" remarked the premier, \"that they will fight.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. And the fight has already begun. The murderer, finding a card\\nof Arsène Lupin\\'s, pinned it to the corpse. All the appearances would\\nthus be against Arsène Lupin . . . therefore, Arsène Lupin would be the\\nmurderer.\"\\n\\n\"True . . . true,\" said Valenglay. \"The calculation seemed pretty\\naccurate.\"\\n\\n\"And the stratagem would have succeeded,\" continued M. Lenormand, \"if in\\nconsequence of another and a less favorable accident, the murderer had\\nnot, either in coming or going, dropped his cigarette-case in room 420,\\nand if the floor-waiter, Gustave Beudot, had not picked it up. From that\\nmoment, knowing himself to be discovered, or on the point of being\\ndiscovered . . .\"\\n\\n\"How did he know it?\"\\n\\n\"How? Why, through M. Formerie, the examining-magistrate, himself! The\\ninvestigation took place with open doors. It is certain that the\\nmurderer was concealed among the people, members of the hotel staff and\\njournalists, who were present when Gustave Beudot was giving his\\nevidence; and when the magistrate sent Gustave Beudot to his attic to\\nfetch the cigarette-case, the man followed and struck the blow. Second\\nvictim!\"\\n\\nNo one protested now. The tragedy was being reconstructed before their\\neyes with a realism and a probable accuracy which were equally striking.\\n\\n\"And the third victim?\" asked Valenglay.\\n\\n\"He himself gave the ruffian his opportunity. When Beudot did not\\nreturn, Chapman, curious to see the cigarette-case for himself, went\\nupstairs with the manager of the hotel. He was surprised by the\\nmurderer, dragged away by him, taken to one of the bedrooms and murdered\\nin his turn.\"\\n\\n\"But why did he allow himself to be dragged away like that and to be led\\nby a man whom he knew to be the murderer of Mr. Kesselbach and of\\nGustave Beudot?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, any more than I know the room in which the crime was\\ncommitted, or the really miraculous way in which the criminal escaped.\"\\n\\n\"Something has been said about two blue labels.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, one was found on the box which Lupin sent back; and the other was\\nfound by me and doubtless came from the morocco note-case stolen by the\\nmurderer.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think that they mean anything. What does mean something is the\\nnumber 813, which Mr. Kesselbach wrote on each of them. His handwriting\\nhas been recognized.\"\\n\\n\"And that number 813?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a mystery.\"\\n\\n\"Then?\"\\n\\n\"I can only reply again that I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"Have you no suspicions?\"\\n\\n\"None at all. Two of my men are occupying one of the rooms in the Palace\\nHotel, on the floor where Chapman\\'s body was found. I have had all the\\npeople in the hotel watched by these two men. The criminal is not one of\\nthose who have left.\"\\n\\n\"Did no one telephone while the murders were being committed?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, some one telephoned from the outside to Major Parbury, one of the\\nfour persons who occupied rooms on the first-floor passage.\"\\n\\n\"And this Major Parbury?\"\\n\\n\"I am having him watched by my men. So far, nothing has been discovered\\nagainst him.\"\\n\\n\"And in which direction do you intend to seek?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, in a very limited direction. In my opinion, the murderer must be\\nnumbered among the friends or connections of Mr. and Mrs. Kesselbach. He\\nfollowed their scent, knew their habits, the reason of Mr. Kesselbach\\'s\\npresence in Paris; and he at least suspected the importance of Mr.\\nKesselbach\\'s plans.\"\\n\\n\"Then he was not a professional criminal?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, certainly not! The murder was committed with extraordinary\\ncleverness and daring, but it was due to circumstances. I repeat, we\\nshall have to look among the people forming the immediate circle of Mr.\\nand Mrs. Kesselbach. And the proof is that Mr. Kesselbach\\'s murderer\\nkilled Gustave Beudot for the sole reason that the waiter had the\\ncigarette-case in his possession; and Chapman for the sole reason that\\nthe secretary knew of its existence. Remember Chapman\\'s excitement: at\\nthe mere description of the cigarette-case, Chapman received a sudden\\ninsight into the tragedy. If he had seen the cigarette-case, we should\\nhave been fully informed. The man, whoever he may be, was well aware of\\nthat: and he put an end to Chapman. And we know nothing, nothing but the\\ninitials L and M.\"\\n\\nHe reflected for a moment and said:\\n\\n\"There is another proof, which forms an answer to one of your questions,\\nMonsieur le Président: Do you believe that Chapman would have\\naccompanied that man along the passages and staircases of the hotel if\\nhe did not already know him?\"\\n\\nThe facts were accumulating. The truth or, at least, the probable truth\\nwas gaining strength. Many of the points at issue, the most interesting,\\nperhaps, remained obscure. But what a light had been thrown upon the\\nsubject! Short of the motives that inspired them, how clearly\\nLenormand\\'s hearers now perceived the sequence of acts performed on that\\ntragic morning!\\n\\nThere was a pause. Every one was thinking, seeking for arguments, for\\nobjections. At last, Valenglay exclaimed:\\n\\n\"My dear Lenormand, this is all quite excellent. You have convinced me.\\n. . . But, taking one thing with another, we are no further than we\\nwere.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"What I say. The object of our meeting is not to clear up a portion of\\nthe mystery, which, one day, I am sure, you will clear up altogether,\\nbut to satisfy the public demand as fully as we possibly can. Now\\nwhether the murderer is Lupin or another; whether there are two\\ncriminals, or three, or only one: all this gives us neither the\\ncriminal\\'s name nor his arrest. And the public continues under the\\ndisastrous impression that the law is powerless.\"\\n\\n\"What can I do?\"\\n\\n\"Give the public the definite satisfaction which it demands.\"\\n\\n\"But it seems to me that this explanation ought to be enough. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Words! The public wants deeds! One thing alone will satisfy it: an\\narrest.\"\\n\\n\"Hang it all! Hang it all! We can\\'t arrest the first person that comes\\nalong!\"\\n\\n\"Even that would be better than arresting nobody,\" said Valenglay, with\\na laugh. \"Come, have a good look round! Are you sure of Edwards,\\nKesselbach\\'s servant?\"\\n\\n\"Absolutely sure. Besides . . . No, Monsieur le Président, it would be\\ndangerous and ridiculous; and I am sure that Mr. Attorney-General\\nhimself . . . There are only two people whom we have the right to\\narrest: the murderer--I don\\'t know who he is--and Arsène Lupin.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"There is no question of arresting Arsène Lupin, or, at least, it\\nrequires time, a whole series of measures, which I have not yet had the\\nleisure to contrive, because I looked upon Lupin as settled down . . .\\nor dead.\"\\n\\nValenglay stamped his foot with the impatience of a man who likes to see\\nhis wishes realized on the spot:\\n\\n\"And yet . . . and yet, my dear Lenormand, something must be done . . .\\nif only for your own sake. You know as well as I do that you have\\npowerful enemies . . . and that, if I were not there . . . In short,\\nLenormand, you can\\'t be allowed to get out of it like this. What are you\\ndoing about the accomplices? There are others besides Lupin. There is\\nMarco; and there\\'s the rogue who impersonated Mr. Kesselbach in order\\nto visit the cellars of the Crédit Lyonnais.\"\\n\\n\"Would you be satisfied if you got him, Monsieur le Président?\"\\n\\n\"Would I be satisfied? Heavens alive, I should think I would!\"\\n\\n\"Well, give me seven days.\"\\n\\n\"Seven days! Why, it\\'s not a question of days, my dear Lenormand! It\\'s a\\nquestion of hours!\"\\n\\n\"How many will you give me, Monsieur le Président?\"\\n\\nValenglay took out his watch and chuckled:\\n\\n\"I will give you ten minutes, my dear Lenormand!\"\\n\\nThe chief took out his, and emphasizing each syllable, said calmly:\\n\\n\"That is four minutes more than I want, Monsieur le Président.\"\\n\\nValenglay looked at him in amazement.\\n\\n\"Four minutes more than you want? What do you mean by that?\"\\n\\n\"I mean, Monsieur le Président, that the ten minutes which you allow me\\nare superfluous. I want six, and not one minute more.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, but look here, Lenormand . . . if you imagine that this is the time\\nfor joking . . .\"\\n\\nThe chief detective went to the window and beckoned to two men who were\\nwalking round the courtyard.\\n\\nThen he returned:\\n\\n\"Mr. Attorney-General, would you have the kindness to sign a warrant for\\nthe arrest of Auguste Maximin Philippe Daileron, aged forty-seven? You\\nmight leave the profession open.\"\\n\\nHe went to the door:\\n\\n\"Come in, Gourel. You, too, Dieuzy.\"\\n\\nGourel entered, accompanied by Inspector Dieuzy.\\n\\n\"Have you the handcuffs, Gourel?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, chief.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand went up to Valenglay:\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Président, everything is ready. But I entreat you most\\nurgently to forego this arrest. It upsets all my plans; it may render\\nthem abortive; and, for the sake of what, after all, is a very trifling\\nsatisfaction, it exposes us to the risk of jeopardizing the whole\\nbusiness.\"\\n\\n\"M. Lenormand, let me remark that you have only eighty seconds left.\"\\n\\nThe chief suppressed a gesture of annoyance, strode across the room and,\\nleaning on his stick, sat down angrily, as though he had decided not to\\nspeak. Then, suddenly making up his mind:\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Président, the first person who enters this room will be\\nthe man whose arrest you asked for . . . against my wish, as I insist on\\npointing out to you.\"\\n\\n\"Fifteen seconds, Lenormand!\"\\n\\n\"Gourel . . . Dieuzy . . . the first person, do you understand? . . .\\nMr. Attorney, have you signed the warrant?\"\\n\\n\"Ten seconds, Lenormand!\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Président, would you be so good as to ring the bell?\"\\n\\nValenglay rang.\\n\\nThe messenger appeared in the doorway and waited.\\n\\nValenglay turned to the chief:\\n\\n\"Well, Lenormand, he\\'s waiting for your orders. Whom is he to show in?\"\\n\\n\"No one.\"\\n\\n\"But the rogue whose arrest you promised us? The six minutes are more\\nthan past.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but the rogue is here!\"\\n\\n\"Here? I don\\'t understand. No one has entered the room!\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I say. . . . Look here, Lenormand, you\\'re making fun of us. I tell\\nyou again that no one has entered the room.\"\\n\\n\"There were six of us in this room, Monsieur le Président; there are\\nseven now. Consequently, some one has entered the room.\"\\n\\nValenglay started:\\n\\n\"Eh! But this is madness! . . . What! You mean to say . . .\"\\n\\nThe two detectives had slipped between the messenger and the door. M.\\nLenormand walked up to the messenger, clapped his hand on his shoulder\\nand, in a loud voice:\\n\\n\"In the name of the law, Auguste Maximin Philippe Daileron, chief\\nmessenger at the Ministry of the Interior, I arrest you.\"\\n\\nValenglay burst out laughing.\\n\\n\"Oh, what a joke! What a joke! That infernal Lenormand! Of all the\\nfirst-rate notions! Well done, Lenormand! It\\'s long since I enjoyed so\\ngood a laugh.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand turned to the attorney-general:\\n\\n\"Mr. Attorney, you won\\'t forget to fill in Master Daileron\\'s profession\\non the warrant, will you? Chief messenger at the Ministry of the\\nInterior.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, good! . . . Oh, capital! . . . Chief messenger at the Ministry of\\nthe Interior!\" spluttered Valenglay, holding his sides. \"Oh, this\\nwonderful Lenormand gets hold of ideas that would never occur to anybody\\nelse! The public is clamoring for an arrest. . . . Whoosh, he flings at\\nits head my chief messenger . . . Auguste . . . the model servant!\\nWell, Lenormand, my dear fellow, I knew you had a certain gift of\\nimagination, but I never suspected that it would go so far as this! The\\nimpertinence of it!\"\\n\\nFrom the commencement of this scene, Auguste had not stirred a limb and\\nseemed to understand nothing of what was going on around him. His face,\\nthe typical face of a good, loyal, faithful serving-man, seemed\\nabsolutely bewildered. He looked at the gentlemen turn and turn about,\\nwith a visible effort to catch the meaning of their words.\\n\\nM. Lenormand said a few words to Gourel, who went out. Then, going up to\\nAuguste and speaking with great decision, he said:\\n\\n\"There\\'s no way out of it. You\\'re caught. The best thing to do, when the\\ngame is lost, is to throw down your cards. What were you doing on\\nTuesday?\"\\n\\n\"I? Nothing. I was here.\"\\n\\n\"You lie. You were off duty. You went out for the day.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes . . . I remember . . . I had a friend to see me from the\\ncountry. . . . We went for a walk in the Bois.\"\\n\\n\"Your friend\\'s name was Marco. And you went for a walk in the cellars of\\nthe Crédit Lyonnais.\"\\n\\n\"I? What an idea! . . . Marco! . . . I don\\'t know any one by that name.\"\\n\\n\"And these? Do you know these?\" cried the chief, thrusting a pair of\\ngold-rimmed spectacles under his nose.\\n\\n\"No . . . certainly not. . . . I don\\'t wear spectacles. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you do; you wear them when you go to the Crédit Lyonnais and when\\nyou pass yourself off as Mr. Kesselbach. These come from your room, the\\nroom which you occupy, under the name of M. Jérôme, at No. 50 Rue du\\nColisee.\"\\n\\n\"My room? _My_ room? I sleep here, at the office.\"\\n\\n\"But you change your clothes over there, to play your parts in Lupin\\'s\\ngang.\"\\n\\nA blow in the chest made him stagger back. Auguste reached the window at\\na bound, climbed over the balcony and jumped into the courtyard.\\n\\n\"Dash it all!\" shouted Valenglay. \"The scoundrel!\"\\n\\nHe rang the bell, ran to the window, wanted to call out. M. Lenormand,\\nwith the greatest calm, said:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t excite yourself, Monsieur le Président . . .\"\\n\\n\"But that blackguard of an Auguste . . .\"\\n\\n\"One second, please. . . . I foresaw this ending . . . in fact, I\\nallowed for it. . . . It\\'s the best confession we could have. . . .\"\\n\\nYielding in the presence of this coolness, Valenglay resumed his seat.\\nIn a moment, Gourel entered, with his hand on the collar of Master\\nAuguste Maximin Philippe Daileron, _alias_ Jérôme, chief messenger at\\nthe Ministry of the Interior.\\n\\n\"Bring him, Gourel!\" said M. Lenormand, as who should say, \"Fetch it!\\nBring it!\" to a good retriever carrying the game in its jaws. \"Did he\\ncome quietly?\"\\n\\n\"He bit me a little, but I held tight,\" replied the sergeant, showing\\nhis huge, sinewy hand.\\n\\n\"Very well, Gourel. And now take this chap off to the Dépôt in a cab.\\nGood-bye for the present, M. Jérôme.\"\\n\\nValenglay was immensely amused. He rubbed his hands and laughed. The\\nidea that his chief messenger was one of Lupin\\'s accomplices struck him\\nas a most delightfully ludicrous thing.\\n\\n\"Well done, my dear Lenormand; this is wonderful! But how on earth did\\nyou manage it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, in the simplest possible fashion. I knew that Mr. Kesselbach was\\nemploying the Barbareux agency and that Lupin had called on him,\\npretending to come from the agency. I hunted in that direction and\\ndiscovered that, when the indiscretion was committed to the prejudice of\\nMr. Kesselbach and of Barbareux, it could only have been to the\\nadvantage of one Jérôme, a friend of one of the clerks at the agency. If\\nyou had not ordered me to hustle things, I should have watched the\\nmessenger and caught Marco and then Lupin.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll catch them, Lenormand, you\\'ll catch them, I assure you. And we\\nshall be assisting at the most exciting spectacle in the world: the\\nstruggle between Lupin and yourself. I shall bet on you.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe next morning the newspapers published the following letter:\\n\\n      \"_Open Letter to M. Lenormand, Chief of the\\n      Detective-service._\\n\\n      \"All my congratulations, dear sir and dear friend, on\\n      your arrest of Jérôme the messenger.

Your demonstration was\\n      clear, logical, irrefutable and, what is more,\\n      truthful. As you know, I do not kill people. Thank you\\n      for proving it on this occasion.

L.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nPRINCE SERNINE AT WORK\\n\\n\\nA ground-floor flat, at the corner of the Boulevard Haussmann and the\\nRue de Courcelles. Here lived Prince Sernine: Prince Sernine, one of the\\nmost brilliant members of the Russian colony in Paris, whose name was\\nconstantly recurring in the \"Arrivals and Departures\" column in the\\nnewspapers.\\n\\nEleven o\\'clock in the morning. The prince entered his study. He was a\\nman of thirty-eight or forty years of age, whose chestnut hair was\\nmingled with a few silver threads on the temples. He had a fresh,\\nhealthy complexion and wore a large mustache and a pair of whiskers cut\\nextremely short, so as to be hardly noticeable against the fresh skin of\\nhis cheeks.\\n\\nHe was smartly dressed in a tight-fitting frock-coat and a white drill\\nwaistcoat, which showed above the opening.\\n\\n\"Come on!\" he said, in an undertone. \"I have a hard day\\'s work before\\nme, I expect.\"\\n\\nHe opened a door leading into a large room where a few people sat\\nwaiting, and said:\\n\\n\"Is Varnier there? Come in, Varnier.\"\\n\\nA man looking like a small tradesman, squat, solidly built, firmly set\\nupon his legs, entered at the summons. The prince closed the door behind\\nhim:\\n\\n\"Well, Varnier, how far are you?\"\\n\\n\"Everything\\'s ready for this evening, governor.\"\\n\\n\"Good. Tell me in a few words.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s like this. After her husband\\'s murder, Mrs. Kesselbach, on the\\nstrength of the prospectuses which you ordered to be sent to her,\\nselected as her residence the establishment known as the Retreat for\\nGentlewomen, at Garches. She occupies the last of the four small houses,\\nat the bottom of the garden, which the management lets to ladies who\\nprefer to live quite apart from the other boarders, the house known as\\nthe Pavillon de l\\'Impératrice.\"\\n\\n\"What servants has she?\"\\n\\n\"Her companion, Gertrude, with whom she arrived a few hours after the\\ncrime, and Gertrude\\'s sister Suzanne, whom she sent for to Monte Carlo\\nand who acts as her maid. The two sisters are devoted to her.\"\\n\\n\"What about Edwards, the valet?\"\\n\\n\"She did not keep him. He has gone back to his own country.\"\\n\\n\"Does she see people?\"\\n\\n\"No. She spends her time lying on a sofa. She seems very weak and ill.\\nShe cries a great deal. Yesterday the examining-magistrate was with her\\nfor two hours.\"\\n\\n\"Very good. And now about the young girl.\"\\n\\n\"Mlle. Geneviève Ernemont lives across the way . . . in a lane running\\ntoward the open country, the third house on the right in the lane. She\\nkeeps a free school for backward children. Her grandmother, Mme.\\nErnemont, lives with her.\"\\n\\n\"And, according to what you wrote to me, Geneviève Ernemont and Mrs.\\nKesselbach have become acquainted?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. The girl went to ask Mrs. Kesselbach for a subscription for her\\nschool. They must have taken a liking to each other, for, during the\\npast four days, they have been walking together in the Parc de\\nVilleneuve, of which the garden of the Retreat is only a dependency.\"\\n\\n\"At what time do they go out?\"\\n\\n\"From five to six. At six o\\'clock exactly the young lady goes back to\\nher school.\"\\n\\n\"So you have arranged the thing?\"\\n\\n\"For six o\\'clock to-day. Everything is ready.\"\\n\\n\"Will there be no one there?\"\\n\\n\"There is never any one in the park at that hour.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. I shall be there. You can go.\"\\n\\nHe sent him out through the door leading to the hall, and, returning to\\nthe waiting-room, called:\\n\\n\"The brothers Doudeville.\"\\n\\nTwo young men entered, a little overdressed, keen-eyed and\\npleasant-looking.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Jean. Good morning, Jacques. Any news at the Prefecture?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing much, governor.\"\\n\\n\"Does M. Lenormand continue to have confidence in you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Next to Gourel, we are his favorite inspectors. A proof is that he\\nhas posted us in the Palace Hotel to watch the people who were living on\\nthe first-floor passage at the time of Chapman\\'s murder. Gourel comes\\nevery morning, and we make the same report to him that we do to you.\"\\n\\n\"Capital. It is essential that I should be informed of all that happens\\nand all that is said at the Prefecture of Police. As long as Lenormand\\nlooks upon you as his men, I am master of the situation. And have you\\ndiscovered a trail of any kind in the hotel?\"\\n\\nJean Doudeville, the elder of the two, replied:\\n\\n\"The Englishwoman who occupied one of the bedrooms has gone.\"\\n\\n\"That doesn\\'t interest me. I know all about her. But her neighbor, Major\\nParbury?\"\\n\\nThey seemed embarrassed. At last, one of them replied:\\n\\n\"Major Parbury, this morning, ordered his luggage to be taken to the\\nGare du Nord, for the twelve-fifty train, and himself drove away in a\\nmotor. We were there when the train left. The major did not come.\"\\n\\n\"And the luggage?\"\\n\\n\"He had it fetched at the station.\"\\n\\n\"By whom?\"\\n\\n\"By a commissionaire, so we were told.\"\\n\\n\"Then his tracks are lost?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"At last!\" cried the prince, joyfully.\\n\\nThe others looked at him in surprise.\\n\\n\"Why, of course,\" he said, \"that\\'s a clue!\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?\"\\n\\n\"Evidently. The murder of Chapman can only have been committed in one of\\nthe rooms on that passage. Mr. Kesselbach\\'s murderer took the secretary\\nthere, to an accomplice, killed him there, changed his clothes there;\\nand, once the murderer had got away, the accomplice placed the corpse in\\nthe passage. But which accomplice? The manner of Major Parbury\\'s\\ndisappearance goes to show that he knows something of the business.\\nQuick, telephone the good news to M. Lenormand or Gourel. The Prefecture\\nmust be informed as soon as possible. The people there and I are\\nmarching hand in hand.\"\\n\\nHe gave them a few more injunctions, concerning their double rôle as\\npolice-inspectors in the service of Prince Sernine, and dismissed them.\\n\\nTwo visitors remained in the waiting-room. He called one of them in:\\n\\n\"A thousand pardons, Doctor,\" he said. \"I am quite at your orders now.\\nHow is Pierre Leduc?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s dead.\"\\n\\n\"Aha!\" said Sernine. \"I expected it, after your note of this morning.\\nBut, all the same, the poor beggar has not been long. . . .\"\\n\\n\"He was wasted to a shadow. A fainting-fit; and it was all over.\"\\n\\n\"Did he not speak?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure that, from the day when the two of us picked him up under\\nthe table in that low haunt at Belleville, are you sure that nobody in\\nyour nursing-home suspected that he was the Pierre Leduc whom the police\\nwere looking for, the mysterious Pierre Leduc whom Mr. Kesselbach was\\ntrying to find at all costs?\"\\n\\n\"Nobody. He had a room to himself. Moreover, I bandaged up his left hand\\nso that the injury to the little finger could not be seen. As for the\\nscar on the cheek, it is hidden by the beard.\"\\n\\n\"And you looked after him yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Myself. And, according to your instructions, I took the opportunity of\\nquestioning him whenever he seemed at all clear in his head. But I could\\nnever get more than an inarticulate stammering out of him.\"\\n\\nThe prince muttered thoughtfully:\\n\\n\"Dead! . . . So Pierre Leduc is dead? . . . The whole Kesselbach case\\nobviously turned on him, and now he disappears . . . without a\\nrevelation, without a word about himself, about his past. . . . Ought I\\nto embark on this adventure, in which I am still entirely in the dark?\\nIt\\'s dangerous. . . . I may come to grief. . . .\"\\n\\nHe reflected for a moment and exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Oh, who cares? I shall go on for all that. It\\'s no reason, because\\nPierre Leduc is dead, that I should throw up the game. On the contrary!\\nAnd the opportunity is too tempting! Pierre Leduc is dead! Long live\\nPierre Leduc! . . . Go, Doctor, go home. I shall ring you up before\\ndinner.\"\\n\\nThe doctor went out.\\n\\n\"Now then, Philippe,\" said Sernine to his last remaining visitor, a\\nlittle gray-haired man, dressed like a waiter at a hotel, a very\\ntenth-rate hotel, however.\\n\\n\"You will remember, governor,\" Philippe began, \"that last week, you made\\nme go as boots to the Hôtel des Deux-Empereurs at Versailles, to keep my\\neye on a young man.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know. . . . Gérard Baupré. How do things stand with him?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s at the end of his resources.\"\\n\\n\"Still full of gloomy ideas?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. He wants to kill himself.\"\\n\\n\"Is he serious?\"\\n\\n\"Quite. I found this little note in pencil among his papers.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Sernine, reading the note. \"He announces his suicide . . .\\nand for this evening too!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, governor, he has bought the rope and screwed the hook to the\\nceiling. Thereupon, acting on your instructions, I talked to him. He\\ntold me of his distress, and I advised him to apply to you: \\'Prince\\nSernine is rich,\\' I said; \\'he is generous; perhaps he will help you.\\'\"\\n\\n\"All this is first-rate. So he is coming?\"\\n\\n\"He is here.\"\\n\\n\"How do you know?\"\\n\\n\"I followed him. He took the train to Paris, and he is walking up and\\ndown the boulevard at this minute. He will make up his mind from one\\nmoment to the other.\"\\n\\nJust then the servant brought in a card. The prince glanced at it and\\nsaid to the man:\\n\\n\"Show M. Gérard Baupré in.\"\\n\\nThen, turning to Philippe:\\n\\n\"You go into the dressing-room, here; listen and don\\'t stir.\"\\n\\nLeft alone, the prince muttered:\\n\\n\"Why should I hesitate? It\\'s fate that sends him my way. . . .\"\\n\\nA few minutes later a tall young man entered. He was fair and slender,\\nwith an emaciated face and feverish eyes, and he stood on the threshold\\nembarrassed, hesitating, in the attitude of a beggar who would like to\\nput out his hand for alms and dares not.\\n\\nThe conversation was brief:\\n\\n\"Are you M. Gérard Baupré?\"\\n\\n\"Yes . . . yes . . . that is my name.\"\\n\\n\"I have not the honor . . .\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s like this, sir. . . . Some one told me . . .\"\\n\\n\"Who?\"\\n\\n\"A hotel servant . . . who said he had been in your service. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Please come to the point. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Well! . . .\"\\n\\nThe young man stopped, taken aback and frightened by the haughty\\nattitude adopted by the prince, who exclaimed:\\n\\n\"But, sir, there must be some . . .\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, the man told me that you were very rich . . . and very\\ngenerous. . . . And I thought that you might possibly . . .\"\\n\\nHe broke off short, incapable of uttering the word of prayer and\\nhumiliation.\\n\\nSernine went up to him.\\n\\n\"M. Gérard Baupré, did you not publish a volume of poetry called _The\\nSmile of Spring_?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried the young man, his face lighting up. \"Have you read\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. . . . Very pretty, your poems, very pretty. . . . Only, do you\\nreckon upon being able to live on what they will bring you?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly . . . sooner or later. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Sooner or later? Later rather than sooner, I expect! And, meantime, you\\nhave come to ask me for the wherewithal to live?\"\\n\\n\"For the wherewithal to buy food, sir.\"\\n\\nSernine put his hand on the young man\\'s shoulder and, coldly:\\n\\n\"Poets do not need food, monsieur. They live on rhymes and dreams. Do as\\nthey do. That is better than begging for bread.\"\\n\\nThe young man quivered under the insult. He turned to the door without a\\nword.\\n\\nSernine stopped him:\\n\\n\"One thing more, monsieur. Have you no resources of any kind?\"\\n\\n\"None at all.\"\\n\\n\"And you are not reckoning on anything?\"\\n\\n\"I have one hope left: I have written to one of my relations, imploring\\nhim to send me something. I shall have his answer to-day. It is my last\\nchance.\"\\n\\n\"And, if you have no answer, you have doubtless made up your mind, this\\nvery evening, to . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\nThis was said quite plainly and simply.\\n\\nSernine burst out laughing:\\n\\n\"Bless my soul, what a queer young man you are! And full of artless\\nconviction, too! Come and see me again next year, will you? We will talk\\nabout all this . . . it\\'s so curious, so interesting . . . and, above\\nall, so funny! . . . Ha, ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\nAnd, shaking with laughter, with affected bows and gestures, he showed\\nhim the door.\\n\\n\"Philippe,\" he said, admitting the hotel-servant, \"did you hear?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, governor.\"\\n\\n\"Gérard Baupré is expecting a telegram this afternoon, a promise of\\nassistance. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it\\'s his last hope.\"\\n\\n\"He must not receive that telegram. If it comes, intercept it and tear\\nit up.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, governor.\"\\n\\n\"Are you alone at your hotel?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, with the cook, who does not sleep in. The boss is away.\"\\n\\n\"Good. So we are the masters. Till this evening, at eleven. Be off.\"\\n\\nPrince Sernine went to his room and rang for his servant:\\n\\n\"My hat, gloves, and stick. Is the car there?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\nHe dressed, went out, and sank into a large, comfortable limousine,\\nwhich took him to the Bois de Boulogne, to the Marquis and Marquise de\\nGastyne\\'s, where he was engaged for lunch.\\n\\nAt half-past two he took leave of his hosts, stopped in the Avenue\\nKléber, picked up two of his friends and a doctor, and at five minutes\\nto three arrived at the Parc des Princes.\\n\\nAt three o\\'clock he fought a sword duel with the Italian Major Spinelli,\\ncut his adversary\\'s ear in the first bout, and, at a quarter to four,\\ntook a bank at the Rue Cambon Club, from which he retired, at twenty\\nminutes past five, after winning forty-seven thousand francs.\\n\\nAnd all this without hurrying, with a sort of haughty indifference, as\\nthough the feverish activity that sent his life whizzing through a whirl\\nof tempestuous deeds and events were the ordinary rule of his most\\npeaceful days.\\n\\n\"Octave,\" he said to his chauffeur, \"go to Garches.\"\\n\\nAnd at ten minutes to six he alighted outside the old walls of the Parc\\nde Villeneuve.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAlthough broken up nowadays and spoilt, the Villeneuve estate still\\nretains something of the splendor which it knew at the time when the\\nEmpress Eugénie used to stay there. With its old trees, its lake and the\\nleafy horizon of the woods of Saint-Cloud, the landscape has a certain\\nmelancholy grace.\\n\\nAn important part of the estate was made over to the Pasteur Institute.\\nA smaller portion, separated from the other by the whole extent of the\\nspace reserved for the public, forms a property contained within the\\nwalls which is still fairly large, and which comprises the House of\\nRetreat, with four isolated garden-houses standing around it.\\n\\n\"That is where Mrs. Kesselbach lives,\" said the prince to himself,\\ncatching sight of the roofs of the house and the four garden-houses in\\nthe distance.\\n\\nHe crossed the park and walked toward the lake.\\n\\nSuddenly he stopped behind a clump of trees. He had seen two ladies\\nagainst the parapet of the bridge that crossed the lake:\\n\\n\"Varnier and his men must be somewhere near. But, by Jove, they are\\nkeeping jolly well hidden! I can\\'t see them anywhere. . . .\"\\n\\nThe two ladies were now strolling across the lawns, under the tall,\\nvenerable trees. The blue of the sky appeared between the branches,\\nwhich swayed in the peaceful breeze, and the scent of spring and of\\nyoung vegetation was wafted through the air.\\n\\nOn the grassy slopes that ran down to the motionless water, daisies,\\nviolets, daffodils, lilies of the valley, all the little flowers of\\nApril and May stood grouped, and, here and there, formed constellations\\nof every color. The sun was sinking on the horizon.\\n\\nAnd, all at once, three men started from a thicket of bushes and made\\nfor the two ladies.\\n\\nThey accosted them. A few words were exchanged. The ladies gave visible\\nsigns of dread. One of the men went up to the shorter of the two and\\ntried to snatch the gold purse which she was carrying in her hand. They\\ncried out; and the three men flung themselves upon them.\\n\\n\"Now or never!\" said the prince.\\n\\nAnd he rushed forward. In ten seconds he had almost reached the brink of\\nthe water. At his approach, the three men fled.\\n\\n\"Run away, you vagabonds,\" he chuckled; \"run for all you are worth!\\nHere\\'s the rescuer coming!\"\\n\\nAnd he set out in pursuit of them. But one of the ladies entreated him:\\n\\n\"Oh, sir, I beg of you . . . my friend is ill.\"\\n\\nThe shorter lady had fallen on the grass in a dead faint.\\n\\nHe retraced his steps and, anxiously:\\n\\n\"She is not wounded?\" he asked. \"Did those scoundrels . . .\"\\n\\n\"No . . . no . . . it\\'s only the fright . . . the excitement. . . .\\nBesides you will understand . . . the lady is Mrs. Kesselbach. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" he said.\\n\\nHe produced a bottle of smelling-salts, which the younger woman at once\\napplied to her friend\\'s nostrils. And he added:\\n\\n\"Lift the amethyst that serves as a stopper. . . . You will see a little\\nbox containing some tabloids. Give madame one of them . . . one, no more\\n. . . they are very strong. . . .\"\\n\\nHe watched the young woman helping her friend. She was fair-haired, very\\nsimply dressed; and her face was gentle and grave, with a smile that lit\\nup her features even when she was not smiling.\\n\\n\"That is Geneviève,\" he thought. And he repeated with emotion,\\n\"Geneviève . . . Geneviève. . . .\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Kesselbach gradually recovered consciousness. She was\\nastonished at first, seemed not to understand. Then, her memory\\nreturning, she thanked her deliverer with a movement of the head.\\n\\nHe made a deep bow and said:\\n\\n\"Allow me to introduce myself. . . . I am Prince Sernine. . . .\"\\n\\nShe said, in a faint voice:\\n\\n\"I do not know how to express my gratitude.\"\\n\\n\"By not expressing it at all, madame. You must thank chance, the chance\\nthat turned my steps in this direction. May I offer you my arm?\"\\n\\nA few minutes later, Mrs. Kesselbach rang at the door of the House of\\nRetreat and said to the prince:\\n\\n\"I will ask one more service of you, monsieur. Do not speak of this\\nassault.\"\\n\\n\"And yet, madame, it would be the only way of finding out . . .\"\\n\\n\"Any attempt to find out would mean an inquiry; and that would involve\\nmore noise and fuss about me, examinations, fatigue; and I am worn out\\nas it is.\"\\n\\nThe prince did not insist. Bowing to her, he asked:\\n\\n\"Will you allow me to call and ask how you are?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly. . . .\"\\n\\nShe kissed Geneviève and went indoors.\\n\\nMeantime, night was beginning to fall. Sernine would not let Geneviève\\nreturn alone. But they had hardly entered the path, when a figure,\\nstanding out against the shadow, hastened toward them.\\n\\n\"Grandmother!\" cried Geneviève.\\n\\nShe threw herself into the arms of an old woman, who covered her with\\nkisses:\\n\\n\"Oh, my darling, my darling, what has happened? How late you are! . . .\\nAnd you are always so punctual!\"\\n\\nGeneviève introduced the prince:\\n\\n\"Prince Sernine . . . Mme. Ernemont, my grandmother. . . .\"\\n\\nThen she related the incident, and Mme. Ernemont repeated:\\n\\n\"Oh, my darling, how frightened you must have been! . . . I shall never\\nforget your kindness, monsieur, I assure you. . . . But how frightened\\nyou must have been, my poor darling!\"\\n\\n\"Come, granny, calm yourself, as I am here. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but the fright may have done you harm. . . . One never knows the\\nconsequences. . . . Oh, it\\'s horrible! . . .\"\\n\\nThey went along a hedge, through which a yard planted with trees, a few\\nshrubs, a playground and a white house were just visible. Behind the\\nhouse, sheltered by a clump of elder-trees arranged to form a covered\\nwalk, was a little gate.\\n\\nThe old lady asked Prince Sernine to come in and led the way to a little\\ndrawing-room or parlor. Geneviève asked leave to withdraw for a moment,\\nto go and see her pupils, whose supper-time it was. The prince and Mme.\\nErnemont remained alone.\\n\\nThe old lady had a sad and a pale face, under her white hair, which\\nended in two long, loose curls. She was too stout, her walk was heavy\\nand, notwithstanding her appearance and her dress, which was that of a\\nlady, she had something a little vulgar about her; but her eyes were\\nimmensely kind.\\n\\nPrince Sernine went up to her, took her head in his two hands and kissed\\nher on both cheeks:\\n\\n\"Well, old one, and how are you?\"\\n\\nShe stood dumfounded, wild-eyed, open-mouthed. The prince kissed her\\nagain, laughing.\\n\\nShe spluttered:\\n\\n\"You! It\\'s you! O mother of God! . . . O mother of God! . . . Is it\\npossible! . . . O mother of God! . . .\"\\n\\n\"My dear old Victoire!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t call me that,\" she cried, shuddering. \"Victoire is dead . . .\\nyour old servant no longer exists.[3] I belong entirely to Geneviève.\"\\nAnd, lowering her voice, \"O mother of God! . . . I saw your name in the\\npapers: then it\\'s true that you have taken to your wicked life again?\"\\n\\n[Footnote 3: See _Arsène Lupin_, by Edgar Jepson and Maurice Leblanc,\\nand _The Hollow Needle_, by Maurice Leblanc, translated by Alexander\\nTeixeira de Mattos.]\\n\\n\"As you see.\"\\n\\n\"And yet you swore to me that it was finished, that you were going away\\nfor good, that you wanted to become an honest man.\"\\n\\n\"I tried. I have been trying for four years. . . . You can\\'t say that I\\nhave got myself talked about during those four years!\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it bores me.\"\\n\\nShe gave a sigh and asked:\\n\\n\"Always the same. . . . You haven\\'t changed. . . . Oh, it\\'s settled, you\\nnever will change. . . . So you are in the Kesselbach case?\"\\n\\n\"Why, of course! But for that, would I have taken the trouble to arrange\\nfor an attack on Mrs. Kesselbach at six o\\'clock, so that I might have\\nthe opportunity of delivering her from the clutches of my own men at\\nfive minutes past? Looking upon me as her rescuer, she is obliged to\\nreceive me. I am now in the heart of the citadel and, while protecting\\nthe widow, can keep a lookout all round. Ah, you see, the sort of life\\nwhich I lead does not permit me to lounge about and waste my time on\\nlittle questions of politeness and such outside matters. I have to go\\nstraight to the point, violently, brutally, dramatically. . . .\"\\n\\nShe looked at him in dismay and gasped:\\n\\n\"I see . . . I see . . . it\\'s all lies about the attack. . . . But then\\n. . . Geneviève . . .\"\\n\\n\"Why, I\\'m killing two birds with one stone! It was as easy to rescue two\\nas one. Think of the time it would have taken, the efforts--useless\\nefforts, perhaps--to worm myself into that child\\'s friendship! What was\\nI to her? What should I be now? An unknown person . . . a stranger.\\nWhereas now I am the rescuer. In an hour I shall be . . . the friend.\"\\n\\nShe began to tremble:\\n\\n\"So . . . so you did not rescue Geneviève. . . . So you are going to mix\\nus up in your affairs. . . .\" And, suddenly, in a fit of rebellion,\\nseizing him by the shoulders, \"No, I won\\'t have it, do you understand?\\nYou brought the child to me one day, saying, \\'Here, I entrust her to you\\n. . . her father and mother are dead . . . take her under your\\nprotection.\\' Well, she\\'s under my protection now and I shall know how to\\ndefend her against you and all your manœuvers!\"\\n\\nStanding straight upright, in a very determined attitude, Mme. Ernemont\\nseemed ready for all emergencies.\\n\\nSlowly and deliberately Sernine loosened the two hands, one after the\\nother, that held him, and in his turn, took the old lady by the\\nshoulders, forced her into an arm-chair, stooped over and, in a very\\ncalm voice, said:\\n\\n\"Rot!\"\\n\\nShe began to cry and, clasping her hands together, implored him:\\n\\n\"I beseech you, leave us in peace. We were so happy! I thought that you\\nhad forgotten us and I blessed Heaven every time a day had passed. Why,\\nyes . . . I love you just the same. But, Geneviève . . . you see,\\nthere\\'s nothing that I wouldn\\'t do for that child. She has taken your\\nplace in my heart.\"\\n\\n\"So I perceive,\" said he, laughing. \"You would send me to the devil with\\npleasure. Come, enough of this nonsense! I have no time to waste. I must\\ntalk to Geneviève.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to talk to her?\"\\n\\n\"Well, is that a crime?\"\\n\\n\"And what have you to tell her?\"\\n\\n\"A secret . . . a very grave secret . . . and a very touching one.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nThe old lady took fright:\\n\\n\"And one that will cause her sorrow, perhaps? Oh, I fear everything, I\\nfear everything, where she\\'s concerned! . . .\"\\n\\n\"She is coming,\" he said.\\n\\n\"No, not yet.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I hear her. . . . Wipe your eyes and be sensible.\"\\n\\n\"Listen,\" said she, eagerly, \"listen. I don\\'t know what you are going to\\nsay, what secret you mean to reveal to this child whom you don\\'t know.\\nBut I, who do know her, tell you this: Geneviève has a very plucky, very\\nspirited, but very sensitive nature. Be careful how you choose your\\nwords. . . . You might wound feelings . . . the existence of which you\\ncannot even suspect. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Lord bless me! And why not?\"\\n\\n\"Because she belongs to another race than you, to a different world.\\n. . . I mean, a different moral world. . . . There are things which you\\nare forbidden to understand nowadays. Between you and her, the obstacle\\nis insurmountable. . . . Geneviève has the most unblemished and upright\\nconscience . . . and you . . .\"\\n\\n\"And I?\"\\n\\n\"And you are not an honest man!\"\\n\\nGeneviève entered, bright and charming:\\n\\n\"All my babies have gone to bed; I have ten minutes to spare. . . . Why,\\ngrandmother, what\\'s the matter? You look quite upset. . . . Is it still\\nthat business with the . . .\"\\n\\n\"No, mademoiselle,\" said Sernine, \"I believe I have had the good fortune\\nto reassure your grandmother. Only, we were talking of you, of your\\nchildhood; and that is a subject, it seems, which your grandmother\\ncannot touch upon without emotion.\"\\n\\n\"Of my childhood?\" said Geneviève, reddening. \"Oh, grandmother!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t scold her, mademoiselle. The conversation turned in that\\ndirection by accident. It so happens that I have often passed through\\nthe little village where you were brought up.\"\\n\\n\"Aspremont?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Aspremont, near Nice. You used to live in a new house, white all\\nover. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"white all over, with a touch of blue paint round the\\nwindows. . . . I was only seven years old when I left Aspremont; but I\\nremember the least things of that period. And I have not forgotten the\\nglare of the sun on the white front of the house, nor the shade of the\\neucalyptus-tree at the bottom of the garden.\"\\n\\n\"At the bottom of the garden, mademoiselle, was a field of olive-trees;\\nand under one of those olive-trees stood a table at which your mother\\nused to work on hot days. . . .\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true, that\\'s true,\" she said, quite excitedly, \"I used to play\\nby her side. . . .\"\\n\\n\"And it was there,\" said he, \"that I saw your mother several times.\\n. . . I recognized her image the moment I set eyes on you . . . but it\\nwas a brighter, happier image.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my poor mother was not happy. My father died on the very day of my\\nbirth, and nothing was ever able to console her. She used to cry a great\\ndeal. I still possess a little handkerchief with which I used to dry her\\ntears at that time.\"\\n\\n\"A little handkerchief with a pink pattern.\"\\n\\n\"What!\" she exclaimed, seized with surprise. \"You know . . .\"\\n\\n\"I was there one day when you were comforting her. . . . And you\\ncomforted her so prettily that the scene remained impressed on my\\nmemory.\"\\n\\nShe gave him a penetrating glance and murmured, almost to herself:\\n\\n\"Yes, yes. . . . I seem to . . . The expression of your eyes . . . and\\nthen the sound of your voice. . . .\"\\n\\nShe lowered her eyelids for a moment and reflected as if she were vainly\\ntrying to bring back a recollection that escaped her. And she continued:\\n\\n\"Then you knew her?\"\\n\\n\"I had some friends living near Aspremont and used to meet her at their\\nhouse. The last time I saw her, she seemed to me sadder still . . .\\npaler . . . and, when I came back again . . .\"\\n\\n\"It was all over, was it not?\" said Geneviève. \"Yes, she went very\\nquickly . . . in a few weeks . . . and I was left alone with neighbors\\nwho sat up with her . . . and one morning they took her away. . . . And,\\non the evening of that day, some one came, while I was asleep, and\\nlifted me up and wrapped me in blankets. . . .\"\\n\\n\"A man?\" asked the prince.\\n\\n\"Yes, a man. He talked to me, quite low, very gently . . . his voice did\\nme good . . . and, as he carried me down the road and also in the\\ncarriage, during the night, he rocked me in his arms and told me stories\\n. . . in the same voice . . . in the same voice . . .\"\\n\\nShe broke off gradually and looked at him again, more sharply than\\nbefore and with a more obvious effort to seize the fleeting impression\\nthat passed over her at moments. He asked:\\n\\n\"And then? Where did he take you?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t recollect clearly . . . it is just as though I had slept for\\nseveral days. . . . I can remember nothing before the little town of\\nMontégut, in the Vendée, where I spent the second half of my childhood,\\nwith Father and Mother Izereau, a worthy couple who reared me and\\nbrought me up and whose love and devotion I shall never forget.\"\\n\\n\"And did they die, too?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"of an epidemic of typhoid fever in the district . . .\\nbut I did not know that until later. . . . As soon as they fell ill, I\\nwas carried off as on the first occasion and under the same conditions,\\nat night, by some one who also wrapped me up in blankets. . . . Only, I\\nwas bigger, I struggled, I tried to call out . . . and he had to close\\nmy mouth with a silk handkerchief.\"\\n\\n\"How old were you then?\"\\n\\n\"Fourteen . . . it was four years ago.\"\\n\\n\"Then you were able to see what the man was like?\"\\n\\n\"No, he hid his face better and he did not speak a single word to me.\\n. . . Nevertheless, I have always believed him to be the same one . . .\\nfor I remember the same solicitude, the same attentive, careful\\nmovements. . . .\"\\n\\n\"And after that?\"\\n\\n\"After that, came oblivion, sleep, as before. . . . This time, I was\\nill, it appears; I was feverish. . . . And I woke in a bright, cheerful\\nroom. A white-haired lady was bending over me and smiling. It was\\ngrandmother . . . and the room was the one in which I now sleep\\nupstairs.\"\\n\\nShe had resumed her happy face, her sweet, radiant expression; and she\\nended, with a smile:\\n\\n\"That was how she became my grandmother and how, after a few trials, the\\nlittle Aspremont girl now knows the delights of a peaceful life and\\nteaches grammar and arithmetic to little girls who are either naughty or\\nlazy . . . but who are all fond of her.\"\\n\\nShe spoke cheerfully, in a tone at once thoughtful and gay, and it was\\nobvious that she possessed a reasonable, well-balanced mind. Sernine\\nlistened to her with growing surprise and without trying to conceal his\\nagitation:\\n\\n\"Have you never heard speak of that man since?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Never.\"\\n\\n\"And would you be glad to see him again?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, very glad.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, mademoiselle . . .\"\\n\\nGeneviève gave a start:\\n\\n\"You know something . . . the truth perhaps . . .\"\\n\\n\"No . . . no . . . only . . .\"\\n\\nHe rose and walked up and down the room. From time to time, his eyes\\nfell upon Geneviève; and it looked as though he were on the point of\\ngiving a more precise answer to the question which she had put to him.\\nWould he speak?\\n\\nMme. Ernemont awaited with anguish the revelation of the secret upon\\nwhich the girl\\'s future peace might depend.\\n\\nHe sat down beside Geneviève, appeared to hesitate, and said at last:\\n\\n\"No . . . no . . . just now . . . an idea occurred to me . . . a\\nrecollection . . .\"\\n\\n\"A recollection? . . . And . . .\"\\n\\n\"I was mistaken. Your story contained certain details that misled me.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\n\\nHe hesitated and then declared:\\n\\n\"Absolutely sure.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said she, greatly disappointed. \"I had half guessed . . . that\\nthat man whom I saw twice . . . that you knew him . . . that . . .\"\\n\\nShe did not finish her sentence, but waited for an answer to the\\nquestion which she had put to him without daring to state it completely.\\n\\nHe was silent. Then, insisting no further, she bent over Mme. Ernemont:\\n\\n\"Good night, grandmother. My children must be in bed by this time, but\\nthey could none of them go to sleep before I had kissed them.\"\\n\\nShe held out her hand to the prince:\\n\\n\"Thank you once more. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Are you going?\" he asked quickly.\\n\\n\"Yes, if you will excuse me; grandmother will see you out.\"\\n\\nHe bowed low and kissed her hand. As she opened the door, she turned\\nround and smiled. Then she disappeared. The prince listened to the sound\\nof her footsteps diminishing in the distance and stood stock-still, his\\nface white with emotion.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the old lady, \"so you did not speak?\"\\n\\n\"No. . . .\"\\n\\n\"That secret . . .\"\\n\\n\"Later. . . . To-day . . . oddly enough . . . I was not able to.\"\\n\\n\"Was it so difficult? Did not she herself feel that you were the\\nstranger who took her away twice. . . . A word would have been enough.\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"Later, later,\" he repeated, recovering all his assurance. \"You can\\nunderstand . . . the child hardly knows me. . . . I must first gain the\\nright to her affection, to her love. . . . When I have given her the\\nlife which she deserves, a wonderful life, such as one reads of in\\nfairy-tales, then I will speak.\"\\n\\nThe old lady tossed her head:\\n\\n\"I fear that you are making a great mistake. Geneviève does not want a\\nwonderful life. She has simple tastes.\"\\n\\n\"She has the tastes of all women; and wealth, luxury and power give joys\\nwhich not one of them despises.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Geneviève does. And you would do much better . . .\"\\n\\n\"We shall see. For the moment, let me go my own way. And be quite easy.\\nI have not the least intention, as you say, of mixing her up in any of\\nmy manœuvers. She will hardly ever see me. . . . Only, we had to come\\ninto contact, you know. . . . That\\'s done. . . . Good-bye.\"\\n\\nHe left the school and walked to where his motor-car was waiting for\\nhim. He was perfectly happy:\\n\\n\"She is charming . . . and so gentle, so grave! Her mother\\'s eyes, eyes\\nthat soften you . . . Heavens, how long ago that all is! And what a\\ndelightful recollection! A little sad, but so delightful!\" And he said,\\naloud, \"Certainly I shall look after her happiness! And that at once!\\nThis very evening! That\\'s it, this very evening she shall have a\\nsweetheart! Is not love the essential condition of any young girl\\'s\\nhappiness?\"\\n\\nHe found his car on the high-road:\\n\\n\"Home,\" he said to Octave.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nWhen Sernine reached home, he rang up Neuilly and telephoned his\\ninstructions to the friend whom he called the doctor. Then he dressed,\\ndined at the Rue Cambon Club, spent an hour at the opera and got into\\nhis car again:\\n\\n\"Go to Neuilly, Octave. We are going to fetch the doctor. What\\'s the\\ntime?\"\\n\\n\"Half-past ten.\"\\n\\n\"Dash it! Look sharp!\"\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car stopped at the end of the Boulevard Inkerman,\\noutside a villa standing in its own grounds. The doctor came down at the\\nsound of the hooter. The prince asked:\\n\\n\"Is the fellow ready?\"\\n\\n\"Packed up, strung up, sealed up.\"\\n\\n\"In good condition?\"\\n\\n\"Excellent. If everything goes as you telephoned, the police will be\\nutterly at sea.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what they\\'re there for. Let\\'s get him on board.\"\\n\\nThey carried into the motor a sort of long sack shaped like a human\\nbeing and apparently rather heavy. And the prince said:\\n\\n\"Go to Versailles, Octave, Rue de la Vilaine. Stop outside the Hôtel des\\nDeux-Empereurs.\"\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s a filthy hotel,\" observed the doctor. \"I know it well; a\\nregular hovel.\"\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t tell me! And it will be a hard piece of work, for me, at\\nleast. . . . But, by Jove, I wouldn\\'t sell this moment for a fortune!\\nWho dares pretend that life is monotonous?\"\\n\\nThey reached the Hôtel des Deux-Empereurs. A muddy alley; two steps\\ndown; and they entered a passage lit by a flickering lamp.\\n\\nSernine knocked with his fist against a little door.\\n\\nA waiter appeared, Philippe, the man to whom Sernine had given orders,\\nthat morning, concerning Gérard Baupré.\\n\\n\"Is he here still?\" asked the prince.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"The rope?\"\\n\\n\"The knot is made.\"\\n\\n\"He has not received the telegram he was hoping for?\"\\n\\n\"I intercepted it: here it is.\"\\n\\nSernine took the blue paper and read it:\\n\\n\"Gad!\" he said. \"It was high time. This is to promise him a thousand\\nfrancs for to-morrow. Come, fortune is on my side. A quarter to twelve.\\n. . . In a quarter of an hour, the poor devil will take a leap into\\neternity. Show me the way, Philippe. You stay here, Doctor.\"\\n\\nThe waiter took the candle. They climbed to the third floor, and,\\nwalking on tip-toe, went along a low and evil-smelling corridor, lined\\nwith garrets and ending in a wooden staircase covered with the musty\\nremnants of a carpet.\\n\\n\"Can no one hear me?\" asked Sernine.\\n\\n\"No. The two rooms are quite detached. But you must be careful not to\\nmake a mistake: he is in the room on the left.\"\\n\\n\"Very good. Now go downstairs. At twelve o\\'clock, the doctor, Octave and\\nyou are to carry the fellow up here, to where we now stand, and wait\\ntill I call you.\"\\n\\nThe wooden staircase had ten treads, which the prince climbed with\\ndefinite caution. At the top was a landing with two doors. It took\\nSernine quite five minutes to open the one of the right without breaking\\nthe silence with the least sound of a creaking hinge.\\n\\nA light gleamed through the darkness of the room. Feeling his way, so as\\nnot to knock against one of the chairs, he made for that light. It came\\nfrom the next room and filtered through a glazed door covered with a\\ntattered hanging.\\n\\nThe prince pulled the threadbare stuff aside. The panes were of ground\\nglass, but scratched in parts, so that, by applying one eye, it was easy\\nto see all that happened in the other room.\\n\\nSernine saw a man seated at a table facing him. It was the poet, Gérard\\nBaupré. He was writing by the light of a candle.\\n\\nAbove his head hung a rope, which was fastened to a hook fixed in the\\nceiling. At the end of the rope was a slip-knot.\\n\\nA faint stroke sounded from a clock in the street.\\n\\n\"Five minutes to twelve,\" thought Sernine. \"Five minutes more.\"\\n\\nThe young man was still writing. After a moment, he put down his pen,\\ncollected the ten or twelve sheets of paper which he had covered and\\nbegan to read them over.\\n\\nWhat he read did not seem to please him, for an expression of discontent\\npassed across his face. He tore up his manuscript and burnt the pieces\\nin the flame of the candle.\\n\\nThen, with a fevered hand, he wrote a few words on a clean sheet, signed\\nit savagely and rose from his chair.\\n\\nBut, seeing the rope at ten inches above his head, he sat down again\\nsuddenly with a great shudder of alarm.\\n\\nSernine distinctly saw his pale features, his lean cheeks, against which\\nhe pressed his clenched fists. A tear trickled slowly down his face, a\\nsingle, disconsolate tear. His eyes gazed into space, eyes terrifying in\\ntheir unutterable sadness, eyes that already seemed to behold the dread\\nunknown.\\n\\nAnd it was so young a face! Cheeks still so smooth, with not a blemish,\\nnot a wrinkle! And blue eyes, blue like an eastern sky! . . .\\n\\nMidnight . . . the twelve tragic strokes of midnight, to which so many a\\ndespairing man has hitched the last second of his existence!\\n\\nAt the twelfth stroke, he stood up again and, bravely this time, without\\ntrembling, looked at the sinister rope. He even tried to give a smile, a\\npoor smile, the pitiful grimace of the doomed man whom death has already\\nseized for its own.\\n\\nSwiftly he climbed the chair and took the rope in one hand.\\n\\nFor a moment, he stood there, motionless: not that he was hesitating or\\nlacking in courage. But this was the supreme moment, the one minute of\\ngrace which a man allows himself before the fatal deed.\\n\\nHe gazed at the squalid room to which his evil destiny had brought him,\\nthe hideous paper on the walls, the wretched bed.\\n\\nOn the table, not a book: all were sold. Not a photograph, not a letter:\\nhe had no father, no mother, no relations. What was there to make him\\ncling to life?\\n\\nWith a sudden movement he put his head into the slip-knot and pulled at\\nthe rope until the noose gripped his neck.\\n\\nAnd, kicking the chair from him with both feet, he leapt into space.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTen seconds, fifteen seconds passed, twenty formidable, eternal seconds.\\n. . .\\n\\nThe body gave two or three jerks. The feet had instinctively felt for a\\nresting-place. Then nothing moved. . . .\\n\\nA few seconds more. . . . The little glazed door opened.\\n\\nSernine entered.\\n\\nWithout the least haste he took the sheet of paper to which the young\\nman had set his signature, and read:\\n\\n      \"Tired of living, ill, penniless, hopeless, I am\\n      taking my own life. Let no one be accused of my death.\\n\\n                                   \"GÉRARD BAUPRÉ.\\n      \"_30 April._\"\\n\\nHe put back the paper on the table where it could be seen, picked up the\\nchair and placed it under the young man\\'s feet. He himself climbed up on\\nthe table and, holding the body close to him, lifted it up, loosened the\\nslip-knot and passed the head through it.\\n\\nThe body sank into his arms. He let it slide along the table and,\\njumping to the floor, laid it on the bed.\\n\\nThen, with the same coolness, he opened the door on the passage:\\n\\n\"Are you there, all the three of you?\" he whispered.\\n\\nSome one answered from the foot of the wooden staircase near him:\\n\\n\"We are here. Are we to hoist up our bundle?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, come along!\"\\n\\nHe took the candle and showed them a light.\\n\\nThe three men trudged up the stairs, carrying the sack in which the\\n\"fellow\" was tied up.\\n\\n\"Put him here,\" he said, pointing to the table.\\n\\nWith a pocket-knife, he cut the cords round the sack. A white sheet\\nappeared, which he flung back. In the sheet was a corpse, the corpse of\\nPierre Leduc.\\n\\n\"Poor Pierre Leduc!\" said Sernine. \"You will never know what you lost by\\ndying so young! I should have helped you to go far, old chap. However,\\nwe must do without your services. . . . Now then, Philippe, get up on\\nthe table; and you, Octave, on the chair. Lift up his head and fasten\\nthe slip-knot.\"\\n\\nTwo minutes later, Pierre Leduc\\'s body was swinging at the end of the\\nrope.\\n\\n\"Capital, that was quite simple! Now you can all of you go. You, Doctor,\\nwill call back here to-morrow morning; you will hear of the suicide of a\\ncertain Gérard Baupré: you understand, Gérard Baupré. Here is his\\nfarewell letter. You will send for the divisional surgeon and the\\ncommissary; you will arrange that neither of them notices that the\\ndeceased has a cut finger or a scar on one cheek. . . .\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s easy.\"\\n\\n\"And you will manage so as to have the report written then and there, to\\nyour dictation.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s easy.\"\\n\\n\"Lastly, avoid having the body sent to the Morgue and make them give\\npermission for an immediate burial.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not so easy.\"\\n\\n\"Try. Have you examined the other one?\"\\n\\nHe pointed to the young man lying lifeless on the bed.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor. \"The breathing is becoming normal. But it was a\\nbig risk to run . . . the carotid artery might have . . .\"\\n\\n\"Nothing venture, nothing have. . . . How soon will he recover\\nconsciousness?\"\\n\\n\"In a few minutes.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. Oh, by the way, don\\'t go yet, Doctor. Wait for me\\ndownstairs. There is more for you to do.\"\\n\\nThe prince, when he found himself alone, lit a cigarette and puffed at\\nit quietly, sending little blue rings of smoke floating up to the\\nceiling.\\n\\nA sigh roused him from his thoughts. He went to the bed. The young man\\nwas beginning to move; and his chest rose and fell violently, like that\\nof a sleeper under the influence of a nightmare. He put his hands to his\\nthroat, as though he felt a pain there; and this action suddenly made\\nhim sit up, terrified, panting. . . .\\n\\nThen he saw Sernine in front of him:\\n\\n\"You?\" he whispered, without understanding. \"You? . . .\"\\n\\nHe gazed at him stupidly, as though he had seen a ghost.\\n\\nHe again touched his throat, felt round his neck. . . . And suddenly he\\ngave a hoarse cry; a mad terror dilated his eyes, made his hair stand on\\nend, shook him from head to foot like an aspen-leaf! The prince had\\nmoved aside; and he saw the man\\'s corpse hanging from the rope.\\n\\nHe flung himself back against the wall. That man, that hanged man, was\\nhimself! He was dead and he was looking at his own dead body! Was this a\\nhideous dream that follows upon death? A hallucination that comes to\\nthose who are no more and whose distracted brain still quivers with a\\nlast flickering gleam of life? . . .\\n\\nHis arms struck at the air. For a moment, he seemed to be defending\\nhimself against the squalid vision. Then, exhausted, he fainted away for\\nthe second time.\\n\\n\"First-rate,\" said the prince, with a grin. \"A sensitive, impressionable\\nnature. . . . At present, the brain is out of gear. . . . Come, this is\\na propitious moment. . . . But, if I don\\'t get the business done in\\ntwenty minutes . . . he\\'ll escape me. . . .\"\\n\\nHe pushed open the door between the two garrets, came back to the bed,\\nlifted the young man and carried him to the bed in the other room. Then\\nhe bathed his temples with cold water and made him sniff at some salts.\\n\\nThis time, the swoon did not last long.\\n\\nGérard timidly opened his eyes and raised them to the ceiling. The\\nvision was gone. But the arrangement of the furniture, the position of\\nthe table and the fireplace, and certain other details all surprised him\\n. . . And then came the remembrance of his act, the pain which he felt\\nat his throat. . . .\\n\\nHe said to the prince:\\n\\n\"I have had a dream, have I not?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"How do you mean, no?\" And, suddenly recollecting, \"Oh, that\\'s true, I\\nremember. . . . I meant to kill myself . . . and I even . . .\" Bending\\nforward anxiously, \"But the rest, the vision . . .\"\\n\\n\"What vision?\"\\n\\n\"The man . . . the rope . . . was that a dream? . . .\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Sernine. \"That also was real.\"\\n\\n\"What are you saying? What are you saying? . . . Oh, no, no! . . . I\\nentreat you! . . . Wake me, if I am asleep . . . or else let me die!\\n. . . But I am dead, am I not? And this is the nightmare of a corpse!\\n. . . Oh, I feel my brain going! . . . I entreat you. . . .\"\\n\\nSernine placed his hand gently on the young man\\'s head and, bending over\\nhim:\\n\\n\"Listen to me . . . listen to me carefully and understand what I say.\\nYou are alive. Your matter and your mind are as they were and live. But\\nGérard Baupré is dead. You understand me, do you not? That member of\\nsociety who was known as Gérard Baupré has ceased to exist. You have\\ndone away with that one. To-morrow, the registrar will write in his\\nbooks, opposite the name you bore, the word \\'Dead,\\' with the date of\\nyour decease.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a lie!\" stammered the terrified lad. \"It\\'s a lie! Considering that\\nI, Gérard Baupré, am here!\"\\n\\n\"You are not Gérard Baupré,\" declared Sernine. And, pointing to the open\\ndoor, \"Gérard Baupré is there, in the next room. Do you wish to see\\nhim? He is hanging from the nail to which you hooked him. On the table\\nis a letter in which you certify his death with your signature. It is\\nall quite regular, it is all final. There is no getting away from the\\nirrevocable, brutal fact: Gérard Baupré has ceased to exist!\"\\n\\nThe young man listened in despair. Growing calmer, now that facts were\\nassuming a less tragic significance, he began to understand:\\n\\n\"And then . . .\" he muttered.\\n\\n\"And then . . . let us talk.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes . . . let us talk. . . .\"\\n\\n\"A cigarette?\" asked the prince. \"Will you have one? Ah, I see that you\\nare becoming reconciled to life! So much the better: we shall understand\\neach other; and that quickly.\"\\n\\nHe lit the young man\\'s cigarette and his own and, at once, in a few\\nwords uttered in a hard voice, explained himself:\\n\\n\"You, the late Gérard Baupré, were weary of life, ill, penniless,\\nhopeless. . . . Would you like to be well, rich, and powerful?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t follow you.\"\\n\\n\"It is quite simple. Accident has placed you on my path. You are young,\\ngood-looking, a poet; you are intelligent and--your act of despair shows\\nit--you have a fine sense of conduct. These are qualities which are\\nrarely found united in one person. I value them . . . and I take them\\nfor my account.\"\\n\\n\"They are not for sale.\"\\n\\n\"Idiot! Who talks of buying or selling? Keep your conscience. It is too\\nprecious a jewel for me to relieve you of it.\"\\n\\n\"Then what do you ask of me?\"\\n\\n\"Your life!\" And, pointing to the bruises on the young man\\'s throat,\\n\"Your life, which you have not known how to employ! Your life, which you\\nhave bungled, wasted, destroyed and which, I propose to build up again,\\nin accordance with an ideal of beauty, greatness and dignity that would\\nmake you giddy, my lad, if you saw the abyss into which my secret\\nthought plunges. . . .\" He had taken Gérard\\'s head between his hands and\\nhe continued, eagerly: \"You are free! No shackles! You have no longer\\nthe weight of your name to bear! You have got rid of that number with\\nwhich society had stamped you as though branding you on the shoulder.\\nYou are free! In this world of slaves where each man bears his label you\\ncan either come and go unknown, invisible, as if you owned Gyges\\' ring\\n. . . or else you can choose your own label, the one you like best! Do\\nyou understand the magnificent treasure which you represent to an artist\\n. . . to yourself, if you like? A virgin life, a brand-new life! Your\\nlife is the wax which you have the right to fashion as you please,\\naccording to the whims of your imagination and the counsels of your\\nreason.\"\\n\\nThe young man made a gesture expressive of weariness:\\n\\n\"Ah, what would you have me do with that treasure? What have I done with\\nit so far? Nothing!\"\\n\\n\"Give it to me.\"\\n\\n\"What can you do with it?\"\\n\\n\"Everything. If you are not an artist, I am; and an enthusiastic artist,\\ninexhaustible, indomitable, exuberant. If you have not the Promethean\\nfire, I have! Where you failed, I shall succeed. Give me your life.\"\\n\\n\"Words, promises!\" cried the young man, whose features began to glow\\nwith animation. \"Empty dreams! I know my own worthlessness! I know my\\ncowardice, my despondency, my efforts that come to nothing, all my\\nwretchedness. To begin life anew, I should need a will which I do not\\npossess. . . .\"\\n\\n\"I possess mine.\"\\n\\n\"Friends. . . .\"\\n\\n\"You shall have them.\"\\n\\n\"Means. . . .\"\\n\\n\"I am providing you with means . . . and such means! You will only have\\nto dip, as one would dip into a magic coffer.\"\\n\\n\"But who are you?\" cried the young man, wildly.\\n\\n\"To others, Prince Sernine. . . . To you . . . what does it matter? I am\\nmore than a prince, more than a king, more than an emperor. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Who are you? . . . Who are you?\" stammered Baupré.\\n\\n\"The Master . . . he who will and who can . . . he who acts. . . . There\\nare no bounds to my will, there is none to my power. I am richer than\\nthe richest man alive, for his fortune is mine. . . . I am more powerful\\nthan the mightiest, for their might is at my service!\"\\n\\nHe took the other\\'s head in his hands again and, looking deep into his\\neyes:\\n\\n\"Be rich, too . . . be mighty. . . . I offer you happiness . . . and the\\njoy of living . . . and peace for your poet\\'s brain . . . and fame and\\nglory also. . . . Do you accept?\"\\n\\n\"Yes . . . yes . . .\" whispered Gérard, dazzled and overmastered. \"What\\nam I to do?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\\n\"But . . .\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, I say. The whole scaffolding of my plans rests on you, but\\nyou do not count. You have no active part to play. You are, for the\\nmoment, but a silent actor, or not even that, but just a pawn which I\\nmove along the board.\"\\n\\n\"What shall I do?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing. Write poetry. You shall live as you please. You shall have\\nmoney. You shall enjoy life. I will not even bother my head about you. I\\nrepeat, you play no part in my venture.\"\\n\\n\"And who shall I be?\"\\n\\nSernine stretched out his arm and pointed to the next room:\\n\\n\"You shall take that man\\'s place. _You are that man!_\"\\n\\nGérard shuddered with revolt and disgust:\\n\\n\"Oh, no, he is dead! . . . And then . . . it is a crime! . . . No, I\\nwant a new life, made for me, thought out for me . . . an unknown name.\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"That man, I tell you!\" cried Sernine, irresistible in his energy and\\nauthority. \"You shall be that man and none other! That man, because his\\ndestiny is magnificent, because his name is illustrious, and because he\\nhands down to you a thrice-venerable heritage of ancestral dignity and\\npride.\"\\n\\n\"It is a crime!\" moaned Baupré, faltering.\\n\\n\"You shall be that man!\" spoke Sernine, with unparalleled vehemence.\\n\"You shall be that man! If not, you become Baupré again; and over Baupré\\nI own rights of life and death. Choose.\"\\n\\nHe drew his revolver, cocked it and took aim at the young man:\\n\\n\"Choose,\" he repeated.\\n\\nThe expression of his face was implacable. Gérard was frightened and\\nsank down on his bed sobbing:\\n\\n\"I wish to live!\"\\n\\n\"You wish it firmly, irrevocably?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a thousand times yes! After the terrible thing which I attempted,\\ndeath appals me. . . . Anything . . . anything rather than death! . . .\\nAnything! . . . Pain . . . hunger . . . illness . . . every torture,\\nevery shame . . . crime itself, if need be . . . but not death!\"\\n\\nHe shivered with fever and agony, as though the great enemy were still\\nprowling round him and as though he felt himself powerless to escape\\nfrom its clutches. The prince redoubled his efforts and, in a fervent\\nvoice, holding him under him like a prey:\\n\\n\"I will ask nothing impossible of you, nothing wrong. . . . If there is\\nanything, I am responsible. . . . No, no crime . . . a little pain at\\nmost. . . . A little of your blood must flow. But what is that, compared\\nwith the dread of dying?\"\\n\\n\"Pain is indifferent to me.\"\\n\\n\"Then here and now!\" shouted Sernine. \"Here and now! Ten seconds of pain\\nand that is all. . . . Ten seconds and the other\\'s life is yours. . . .\"\\n\\nHe had seized him round the body and forced him down on a chair; and he\\nnow held the young man\\'s left hand flat on the table, with his five\\nfingers spread out. He swiftly took a knife from his pocket, pressed the\\nblade against the little finger, between the first and second joints,\\nand commanded:\\n\\n\"Strike! Strike your own blow. One blow of the fist and that is all!\"\\n\\nHe had taken Gérard\\'s right hand and was trying to bring it down upon\\nthe other like a hammer.\\n\\nGérard writhed and twisted, convulsed with horror. He understood:\\n\\n\"Never!\" he stuttered. \"Never!\"\\n\\n\"Strike! One blow and it\\'s done! One blow and you will be like that man:\\nno one will recognize you.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me his name. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Strike first!\"\\n\\n\"Never! Oh, what torture! . . . I beseech you . . . presently. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Now. . . . I insist . . . you must . . .\"\\n\\n\"No . . . no . . . I can\\'t do it. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Strike, you fool! It means fortune, fame, love. . . .\"\\n\\nGérard raised his fist with a sudden movement.\\n\\n\"Love,\" he said, \"yes . . . for that, yes. . . .\"\\n\\n\"You will love and be loved,\" said Sernine. \"Your betrothed awaits you.\\nI have chosen her myself. She is the purest of the pure, the fairest of\\nthe fair. But you must win her. Strike!\"\\n\\nThe lad\\'s arm stiffened for the fatal blow; but the instinct of\\nself-preservation was too strong for him. His body was wrung with a\\nsuperhuman effort. He suddenly released himself from Sernine\\'s hold and\\nfled.\\n\\nHe rushed like a madman to the other room. A yell of terror escaped him,\\nat the sight of the abominable vision, and he came back and fell on his\\nknees before Sernine, beside the table.\\n\\n\"Strike!\" said the prince, again spreading out the lad\\'s fingers and\\nfixing the blade of the knife.\\n\\nWhat followed was done mechanically. With an automatic movement, with\\nhaggard eyes and a livid face, the young man raised his fist and struck:\\n\\n\"Ah!\" he cried, with a moan of pain.\\n\\nA small piece of flesh was separated from the little finger. Blood\\nflowed. For the third time, Gérard fainted.\\n\\nSernine looked at him for a second or two and said, gently:\\n\\n\"Poor little chap! . . . There, I\\'ll reward you for what you\\'ve done;\\nand a hundred times over. I always pay generously.\"\\n\\nHe went downstairs and found the doctor waiting below:\\n\\n\"It\\'s done. Go upstairs, you, and make a little cut in his right cheek,\\nsimilar to Pierre Leduc\\'s. The two scars must be exactly alike. I shall\\ncome back for you in an hour.\"\\n\\n\"Where are you going?\"\\n\\n\"To take the air. My heart feels anyhow.\"\\n\\nOutside he drew a long breath and lit another cigarette:\\n\\n\"A good day\\'s work,\" he muttered. \"A little over-crowded, a little\\ntiring, but fruitful, really fruitful. I am Dolores Kesselbach\\'s friend.\\nI am Geneviève\\'s friend. I have manufactured a new Pierre Leduc, a very\\npresentable one and entirely at my disposal. Lastly, I have found\\nGeneviève a husband of the sort that you don\\'t find by the dozen. Now my\\ntask is done. I have only to gather the fruit of my efforts. It\\'s your\\nturn to work, M. Lenormand. I, for my part, am ready.\" And he added,\\nthinking of the poor mutilated lad whom he had dazzled with his\\npromises, \"Only--for there is an \\'only\\'--I have not the slightest notion\\nwho this Pierre Leduc was, whose place I have magnanimously awarded to\\nthat good young man. And that\\'s very annoying. . . . For when all is\\nsaid, there\\'s nothing to prove to me that Pierre Leduc was not the son\\nof a pork-butcher! . . .\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nM. LENORMAND AT WORK\\n\\n\\nOn the morning of the 31st of May, all the newspapers reminded their\\nreaders that Lupin, in a letter addressed to M. Lenormand, had announced\\nthe escape of the messenger Jérôme for that date. And one of them summed\\nup the situation, as it then stood, in very able terms:\\n\\n      \"The horrible carnage at the Palace Hotel took place\\n      as far back as the 17th of April. What has been\\n      discovered since? Nothing.\\n\\n      \"There were three clues: the cigarette-case, the\\n      initials L and M and the parcel of clothes left behind\\n      in the office of the hotel. What advantage has been\\n      taken of these clues? None.\\n\\n      \"It appears that the police suspect one of the\\n      visitors who was staying on the first floor and who\\n      disappeared in a doubtful manner. Have they found him?\\n      Have they established his identity? No.\\n\\n      \"The tragedy, therefore, remains as mysterious as at\\n      the beginning, the gloom is impenetrable.\\n\\n      \"To complete the picture, we are told that dissension\\n      prevails between the prefect of police and his\\n      subordinate, M. Lenormand, and that the latter,\\n      finding himself less vigorously supported by the prime\\n      minister, virtually sent in his resignation several\\n      days ago. According to our information, the conduct of\\n      the Kesselbach case is now in the hands of the\\n      deputy-chief of the detective-service, M. Weber, a\\n      personal enemy of M. Lenormand\\'s.\\n\\n      \"In short, disorder and confusion reign; and this in\\n      the face of Lupin, who stands for method, energy and\\n      steadfastness of mind.\\n\\n      \"What conclusion do we draw from these facts? Briefly,\\n      this: Lupin will release his accomplice to-day, the\\n      31st of May, as he foretold.\"\\n\\nThis conclusion, which was echoed in all the other newspapers, was also\\nthe conclusion at which the general public had arrived. And we must take\\nit that the threat was not considered devoid of importance in high\\nplaces, for the prefect of police and, in the absence of M. Lenormand,\\nwho was said to be unwell, the deputy-chief of the detective-service, M.\\nWeber, had adopted the most stringent measures, both at the Palais de\\nJustice and at the Santé Prison, where the prisoner was confined.\\n\\nThey did not dare, for sheer reasons of shame, to suspend on that\\nparticular day the examinations conducted daily by M. Formerie; but,\\nfrom the prison to the Boulevard du Palais, a regular mobilization of\\npolice-forces guarded the streets along the line.\\n\\nTo the intense astonishment of one and all, the 31st of May passed and\\nthe threatened escape did not take place.\\n\\nOne thing did happen, an attempt to execute the plan, as was betrayed by\\na block of tramway-cars, omnibuses and drays along the road taken by the\\nprison-van and the unaccountable breaking of one of the wheels of the\\nvan itself. But the attempt assumed no more definite form.\\n\\nLupin, therefore, had met with a check. The public felt almost\\ndisappointed and the police triumphed loudly.\\n\\nOn the next day, Saturday, an incredible rumour spread through the\\nPalais and the newspaper-offices: Jérôme the messenger had disappeared.\\n\\nWas it possible? Although the special editions confirmed the news,\\npeople refused to believe it. But, at six o\\'clock, a note published by\\nthe _Dépêche du Soir_ made it official:\\n\\n      \"We have received the following communication signed\\n      by Arsène Lupin. The special stamp affixed to it, in\\n      accordance with the circular which Lupin recently sent\\n      to the press, guarantees the genuineness of the\\n      document:\\n\\n      \"\\'_To the Editor of the_ Dépêche du Soir.\\n\\n      \"SIR,\\n\\n      \"\\'Pray make my apologies to the public for not keeping\\n      my word yesterday. I remembered, at the last moment,\\n      that the 31st of May fell on a Friday! Could I set my\\n      friend at liberty on a Friday? I did not think it\\n      right to assume that responsibility.\\n\\n      \"\\'I must also apologize for not on this occasion\\n      explaining, with my customary frankness, how this\\n      little event was managed. My process is so ingenious\\n      and so simple that I fear lest, if I revealed it,\\n      every criminal should be inspired by it. How surprised\\n      people will be on the day when I am free to speak! \"Is\\n      that all?\" I shall be asked. That is all; but it had\\n      to be thought of.\\n\\n         \"\\'Permit me to be, Sir,\\n                    \"\\'Your obedient servant,\\n                                 \"\\'ARSÈNE LUPIN.\\'\"\\n\\nAn hour later, M. Lenormand was rung up on the telephone and informed\\nthat Valenglay, the prime minister, wished to see him at the Ministry of\\nthe Interior.\\n\\n             *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"How well you\\'re looking, my dear Lenormand! And I who thought that you\\nwere ill and dared not leave your room!\"\\n\\n\"I am not ill, Monsieur le Président.\"\\n\\n\"So you were sulking in your tent! . . . But you were always a\\nbad-tempered fellow.\"\\n\\n\"I confess to the bad temper, Monsieur le Président, but not to the\\nsulking.\"\\n\\n\"But you stay at home! And Lupin takes advantage of it to release his\\nfriends. . . .\"\\n\\n\"How could I stop him?\"\\n\\n\"How? Why, Lupin\\'s trick was of the plainest. In accordance with his\\nusual method, he announced the date of the escape beforehand; everybody\\nbelieved in it; an apparent attempt was planned; the escape was not\\nmade; and, on the next day, when nobody is thinking about\\nit--whoosh!--the bird takes flight.\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Président,\" said the chief of the detective-service,\\nsolemnly, \"Lupin disposes of such means that we are not in a position to\\nprevent what he has decided on. The escape was mathematically certain. I\\npreferred to pass the hand . . . and leave the laughter for others to\\nface.\"\\n\\nValenglay chuckled:\\n\\n\"It\\'s a fact that Monsieur le Préfet de Police and M. Weber cannot be\\nenjoying themselves at the present moment. . . . But, when all is said,\\ncan you explain to me, M. Lenormand . . .\"\\n\\n\"All that we know, Monsieur le Président, is that the escape took place\\nfrom the Palais de Justice. The prisoner was brought in a prison-van and\\ntaken to M. Formerie\\'s room. He left M. Formerie\\'s room, but he did not\\nleave the Palais de Justice. And yet nobody knows what became of him.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s most bewildering.\"\\n\\n\"Most bewildering.\"\\n\\n\"And has nothing else been discovered?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. The inner corridor leading to the examining magistrates\\' rooms was\\nblocked by an absolutely unprecedented crowd of prisoners, warders,\\ncounsel and doorkeepers; and it was discovered that all those people had\\nreceived forged notices to appear at the same hour. On the other hand,\\nnot one of the examining-magistrates who were supposed to have summoned\\nthem sat in his room that day; and this because of forged notices from\\nthe public prosecutor\\'s office, sending them to every part of Paris\\n. . . and of the outskirts.\"\\n\\n\"Is that all?\"\\n\\n\"No. Two municipal guards and a prisoner were seen to cross the\\ncourtyards. A cab was waiting for them outside and all three stepped in.\\n\\n\"And your supposition, Lenormand, your opinion. . . .\"\\n\\n\"My supposition, Monsieur le Président, is that the two municipal guards\\nwere accomplices who, profiting by the disorder in the corridor, took\\nthe place of the three warders. And my opinion is that this escape\\nsucceeded only through such special circumstances and so strange a\\ncombination of facts that we must look upon the most unlikely cases of\\ncomplicity as absolutely certain. Lupin, for that matter, has\\nconnections at the Palais that balk all our calculations. He has agents\\nin your ministry. He has agents at the Prefecture of Police. He has\\nagents around me. It is a formidable organization, a detective-service a\\nthousand times more clever, more daring, more varied and more supple\\nthan that under my own orders.\"\\n\\n\"And you stand this, Lenormand?\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not.\"\\n\\n\"Then why this slackness on your part since the beginning of the case?\\nWhat have you done against Lupin?\"\\n\\n\"I have prepared for the struggle.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, capital! And, while you were preparing, he was acting.\"\\n\\n\"So was I.\"\\n\\n\"And do you know anything?\"\\n\\n\"I know a great deal.\"\\n\\n\"What? Speak!\"\\n\\nLeaning on his stick, M. Lenormand took a little contemplative walk\\nacross the spacious room. Then he sat down opposite Valenglay, brushed\\nthe facings of his olive-green coat with his finger-tips, settled his\\nspectacles on his nose and said, plainly:\\n\\n\"M. le Président, I hold three trump-cards in my hand. First, I know the\\nname under which Arsène Lupin is hiding at this moment, the name under\\nwhich he lived on the Boulevard Haussmann, receiving his assistants\\ndaily, reconstructing and directing his gang.\"\\n\\n\"But then why, in heaven\\'s name, don\\'t you arrest him?\"\\n\\n\"I did not receive these particulars until later. The prince--let us\\ncall him Prince Dash--has disappeared. He is abroad, on other\\nbusiness.\"\\n\\n\"And, if he does not return . . .\"\\n\\n\"The position which he occupies, the manner in which he has flung\\nhimself into the Kesselbach case, necessitate his return and under the\\nsame name.\"\\n\\n\"Nevertheless . . .\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Président, I come to my second trump. I have at last\\ndiscovered Pierre Leduc.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\"\\n\\n\"Or rather Lupin discovered him, and before disappearing, settled him in\\na little villa in the neighborhood of Paris.\"\\n\\n\"By Jove! But how did you know . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh, easily! Lupin has placed two of his accomplices with Pierre Leduc,\\nto watch him and defend him. Now these accomplices are two of my own\\ndetectives, two brothers whom I employ in the greatest secrecy and who\\nwill hand him over to me at the first opportunity!\"\\n\\n\"Well done you! So that . . .\"\\n\\n\"So that, as Pierre Leduc, we may say, is the central point of the\\nefforts of all those who are trying to solve the famous Kesselbach\\nsecret, I shall, sooner or later, through Pierre Leduc, catch, first,\\nthe author of the treble murder, because that miscreant substituted\\nhimself for Mr. Kesselbach in the accomplishment of an immense scheme\\nand because Mr. Kesselbach had to find Pierre Leduc in order to be able\\nto accomplish that scheme; and, secondly, Arsène Lupin, because Arsène\\nLupin is pursuing the same object.\"\\n\\n\"Splendid! Pierre Leduc is the bait which you are throwing to the\\nenemy.\"\\n\\n\"And the fish is biting, Monsieur le Président. I have just had word\\nthat a suspicious person was seen, a short time ago, prowling round the\\nlittle villa where Pierre Leduc is living under the protection of my\\nofficers. I shall be on the spot in four hours.\"\\n\\n\"And the third trump, Lenormand?\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Président, a letter arrived yesterday, addressed to Mr.\\nRudolf Kesselbach, which I intercepted. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Intercepted, eh? You\\'re getting on!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I intercepted it, opened it and kept it for myself. Here it is. It\\nis dated two months back. It bears the Capetown postmark and contains\\nthese words: \\'My dear Rudolf, I shall be in Paris on the 1st of June and\\nin just as wretched a plight as when you came to my assistance. But I\\nhave great hopes of this Pierre Leduc affair of which I told you. What a\\nstrange story it is! Have you found the man I mean? Where do we stand? I\\nam most anxious to know.\\' The letter is signed, \\'Steinweg.\\' The first of\\nJune,\" continued M. Lenormand, \"is to-day. I have ordered one of my\\ninspectors to hunt me out this Steinweg. I have no doubt that he will\\nsucceed.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I, no doubt at all,\" cried Valenglay, rising from his chair, \"and I\\nmake you every apology, my dear Lenormand, and my humble confession: I\\nwas on the point of letting you slide . . . for good and all! To-morrow\\nI was expecting the prefect of police and M. Weber.\"\\n\\n\"I knew that, Monsieur le Président.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible!\"\\n\\n\"But for that, should I have put myself out? You now see my plan of\\ncampaign. On the one side, I am setting traps in which the murderer will\\nbe caught sooner or later. Pierre Leduc or Steinweg will deliver him\\ninto my hands. On the other side, I am on Arsène Lupin\\'s heels. Two of\\nhis agents are in my pay and he believes them to be his most devoted\\nhelpers. In addition to this, he is working for me, because he is\\npursuing the perpetrator of the threefold crime as I am. Only, he\\nimagines that he is dishing me, whereas it is I who am dishing him. So I\\nshall succeed, but on one condition. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What is that?\"\\n\\n\"That I am given free scope and allowed to act according to the needs of\\nthe moment, without troubling about the public, who are growing\\nimpatient, or my superiors, who are intriguing against me.\"\\n\\n\"I agree.\"\\n\\n\"In that case, Monsieur le Président, in a few days from this I shall be\\nthe victor . . . or I shall be dead.\"\\n\\n             *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAt Saint-Cloud. A little villa situated on one of the highest points of\\nthe upland, in an unfrequented road.\\n\\nIt was eleven o\\'clock at night. M. Lenormand left his car at Saint-Cloud\\nand walked cautiously along the road. A shadow appeared.\\n\\n\"Is that you, Gourel?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, chief.\"\\n\\n\"Did you tell the brothers Doudeville that I was coming?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, your room is ready, you can go to bed and sleep . . . unless they\\ntry to carry off Pierre Leduc to-night, which would not surprise me,\\nconsidering the behavior of the fellow whom the Doudevilles saw.\"\\n\\nThey walked across the garden, softly entered the house and went up to\\nthe first floor. The two brothers, Jean and Jacques Doudeville, were\\nthere.\\n\\n\"No news of Prince Sernine?\" asked Lenormand.\\n\\n\"No, chief.\"\\n\\n\"What about Pierre Leduc?\"\\n\\n\"He spends the whole day lying flat on his back in his room on the\\nground-floor, or else in the garden. He never comes up to see us.\"\\n\\n\"Is he better?\"\\n\\n\"Much better. The rest has made a great change in his appearance.\"\\n\\n\"Is he wholly devoted to Lupin?\"\\n\\n\"To Prince Sernine, rather, for he does not suspect that the two are one\\nand the same man. At least, I suppose so. One never knows, with him. He\\ndoes not speak at all. Oh, he\\'s a queer fish! There\\'s only one person\\nwho has the gift of cheering him up, of making him talk and even laugh.\\nThat\\'s a young girl from Garches, to whom Prince Sernine introduced him.\\nGeneviève Ernemont her name is. She has been here three times already\\n. . . she was here to-day.\" He added, jestingly, \"I believe there\\'s a\\nlittle flirting going on. . . . It\\'s like his highness Prince Sernine\\nand Mrs. Kesselbach. . . . It seems he\\'s making eyes at her! . . . That\\ndevil of a Lupin!\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand did not reply. But it was obvious that all these details,\\nto which he seemed to attach no importance, were noted in the recesses\\nof his memory, to be used whenever he might need to draw the logical\\ninferences from them. He lit a cigar, chewed it without smoking it, lit\\nit again and dropped it.\\n\\nHe asked two or three more questions and then, dressed as he was, threw\\nhimself on his bed:\\n\\n\"If the least thing happens, let me be awakened. . . . If not, I shall\\nsleep through the night. . . . Go to your posts, all of you.\"\\n\\nThe others left the room.\\n\\nAn hour passed, two hours.\\n\\nSuddenly, M. Lenormand felt some one touch him and Gourel said to him:\\n\\n\"Get up, chief; they have opened the gate.\"\\n\\n\"One man or two?\"\\n\\n\"I only saw one . . . the moon appeared just then . . . he crouched down\\nagainst a hedge.\"\\n\\n\"And the brothers Doudeville?\"\\n\\n\"I sent them out by the back. They will cut off his retreat when the\\ntime comes.\"\\n\\nGourel took M. Lenormand\\'s hand, led him downstairs and then into a\\nlittle dark room:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t stir, chief; we are in Pierre Leduc\\'s dressing-room. I am opening\\nthe door of the recess in which his bed stands. . . . Don\\'t be afraid\\n. . . he has taken his veronal as he does every evening . . . nothing\\ncan wake him. Come this way. . . . It\\'s a good hiding-place, isn\\'t it?\\n. . . These are the curtains of his bed. . . . From here you can see the\\nwindow and the whole side of the room between the window and the bed.\"\\n\\nThe casement stood open and admitted a vague light, which became very\\nprecise at times, when the moon burst through her veil of clouds. The\\ntwo men did not take their eyes from the empty window-frame, feeling\\ncertain that the event which they were awaiting would come from that\\nside.\\n\\nA slight, creaking noise . . .\\n\\n\"He is climbing the trellis,\" whispered Gourel.\\n\\n\"Is it high?\"\\n\\n\"Six feet or so.\"\\n\\nThe creaking became more distinct.\\n\\n\"Go, Gourel,\" muttered M. Lenormand, \"find the Doudevilles, bring them\\nback to the foot of the wall and bar the road to any one who tries to\\nget down this way.\"\\n\\nGourel went. At the same moment, a head appeared at the level of the\\nwindow. Then a leg was flung over the balcony. M. Lenormand\\ndistinguished a slenderly-built man, below the middle height, dressed in\\ndark colours and without a hat.\\n\\nThe man turned and, leaning over the balcony, looked for a few seconds\\ninto space, as though to make sure that no danger threatened him. Then\\nhe stooped down and lay at full length on the floor. He appeared\\nmotionless. But soon M. Lenormand realized that the still blacker shadow\\nwhich he formed against the surrounding darkness was coming forward,\\nnearer.\\n\\nIt reached the bed.\\n\\nM. Lenormand had an impression that he could hear the man\\'s breathing\\nand, at the same time, that he could just see his eyes, keen, glittering\\neyes, which pierced the darkness like shafts of fire and which\\nthemselves could see through that same darkness.\\n\\nPierre Leduc gave a deep sigh and turned over.\\n\\nA fresh silence. . . .\\n\\nThe man had glided along the bed with imperceptible movements and his\\ndark outline now stood out against the whiteness of the sheets that hung\\ndown to the floor.\\n\\nM. Lenormand could have touched him by putting out his arm. This time,\\nhe clearly distinguished the breathing, which alternated with that of\\nthe sleeper, and he had the illusion that he also heard the sound of a\\nheart beating.\\n\\nSuddenly, a flash of light. . . . The man had pressed the spring of an\\nelectric lantern; and Pierre Leduc was lit full in the face, but the man\\nremained in the shade, so that M. Lenormand was unable to see his\\nfeatures.\\n\\nAll that he saw was something that shone in the bright space; and he\\nshuddered. It was the blade of a knife; and that thin, tapering knife,\\nmore like a stiletto than a dagger, seemed to him identical with the\\nweapon which he had picked up by the body of Chapman, Mr. Kesselbach\\'s\\nsecretary.\\n\\nHe put forth all his will-power to restrain himself from springing upon\\nthe man. He wanted first to know what the man had come to do.\\n\\nThe hand was raised. Was he going to strike? M. Lenormand calculated the\\ndistance in order to stop the blow. . . . But no, it was not a murderous\\ngesture, but one of caution. The hand would only fall if Pierre Leduc\\nstirred or tried to call out. And the man bent over the sleeper, as\\nthough he were examining something.\\n\\n\"The right cheek,\" thought M. Lenormand, \"the scar on the right cheek.\\n. . . He wants to make sure that it is really Pierre Leduc.\"\\n\\nThe man had turned a little to one side, so that only his shoulders were\\nvisible. But his clothes, his overcoat, were so near that they brushed\\nagainst the curtains behind which M. Lenormand was hiding.\\n\\n\"One movement on his part,\" thought the chief detective, \"a thrill of\\nalarm; and I shall collar him.\"\\n\\nBut the man, entirely absorbed in his examination, did not stir. At\\nlast, after shifting the dagger to the hand that held the lantern, he\\nraised the sheet, at first hardly at all, then a little more, then more\\nstill, until the sleeper\\'s left arm was uncovered and the hand laid\\nbare. The flash of the lantern shone upon the hand. The fingers lay\\noutspread. The little finger was cut on the second joint.\\n\\nAgain Pierre Leduc made a movement. The light was immediately put out;\\nand, for an instant, the man remained beside the bed, motionless,\\nstanding straight up. Would he make up his mind to strike? M. Lenormand\\nunderwent the agony of the crime which he could so easily prevent, but\\nwhich he did not want to forestall before the very last second.\\n\\nA long, a very long silence. Suddenly, he saw or rather fancied that he\\nsaw an arm uplifted. Instinctively he moved, stretching his hand above\\nthe sleeper. In making this gesture, he hit against the man.\\n\\nA dull cry. The fellow struck out at space, defended himself at random\\nand fled toward the window. But M. Lenormand had leapt upon him and had\\nhis two arms around the man\\'s shoulders.\\n\\nHe at once felt him yielding and, as the weaker of the two, powerless in\\nLenormand\\'s hands, trying to avoid the struggle and to slip from between\\nhis arms. Lenormand, exerting all his strength, held him flat against\\nhis chest, bent him in two and stretched him on his back on the floor.\\n\\n\"Ah, I\\'ve got him, I\\'ve got him!\" he muttered triumphantly.\\n\\nAnd he felt a singular elation at imprisoning that terrifying criminal,\\nthat unspeakable monster, in his irresistible grip. He felt him living\\nand quivering, enraged and desperate, their two lives mingled, their\\nbreaths blended:\\n\\n\"Who are you?\" he asked. \"Who are you? . . . You\\'ll have to speak.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nAnd he clasped the enemy\\'s body with still greater force, for he had an\\nimpression that that body was diminishing between his arms, that it was\\nvanishing. He gripped harder . . . and harder. . . .\\n\\nAnd suddenly he shuddered from head to foot. He had felt, he still felt\\na tiny prick in the throat. . . . In his exasperation, he gripped harder\\nyet: the pain increased! And he observed that the man had succeeded in\\ntwisting one arm round, slipping his hand to his chest and holding the\\ndagger on end. The arm, it was true, was incapable of motion; but the\\ncloser M. Lenormand tightened his grip, the deeper did the point of the\\ndagger enter the proffered flesh.\\n\\nHe flung back his head a little to escape the point: the point followed\\nthe movement and the wound widened.\\n\\nThen he moved no more, remembering the three crimes and all the\\nalarming, atrocious and prophetic things represented by that same little\\nsteel needle which was piercing his skin and which, in its turn, was\\nimplacably penetrating. . . .\\n\\nSuddenly, he let go and gave a leap backwards. Then, at once, he tried\\nto resume the offensive. It was too late. The man flung his legs across\\nthe window-sill and jumped.\\n\\n\"Look out, Gourel!\" he cried, knowing that Gourel was there, ready to\\ncatch the fugitive.\\n\\nHe leant out. A crunching of pebbles . . . a shadow between two trees,\\nthe slam of the gate. . . . And no other sound . . . no interference.\\n. . .\\n\\nWithout giving a thought to Pierre Leduc, he called:\\n\\n\"Gourel! . . . Doudeville!\"\\n\\nNo answer. The great silence of the countryside at night. . . .\\n\\nIn spite of himself, he continued to think of the treble murder, the\\nsteel dagger. But no, it was impossible, the man had not had time, had\\nnot even had the need to strike, as he had found the road clear.\\n\\nM. Lenormand jumped out in his turn and, switching on his lantern,\\nrecognized Gourel lying on the ground:\\n\\n\"Damn it!\" he swore. \"If they\\'ve killed him, they\\'ll have to pay dearly\\nfor it.\"\\n\\nBut Gourel was not dead, only stunned; and, a few minutes later, he came\\nto himself and growled:\\n\\n\"Only a blow of the fist, chief . . . just a blow of the fist which\\ncaught me full in the chest. But what a fellow!\"\\n\\n\"There were two of them then?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a little one, who went up, and another, who took me unawares while\\nI was watching.\"\\n\\n\"And the Doudevilles?\"\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t seen them.\"\\n\\nOne of them, Jacques, was found near the gate, bleeding from a punch in\\nthe jaw; the other a little farther, gasping for breath from a blow full\\non the chest.\\n\\n\"What is it? What happened?\" asked M. Lenormand.\\n\\nJacques said that his brother and he had knocked up against an\\nindividual who had crippled them before they had time to defend\\nthemselves.\\n\\n\"Was he alone?\"\\n\\n\"No; when he passed near us, he had a pal with him, shorter than\\nhimself.\"\\n\\n\"Did you recognize the man who struck you?\"\\n\\n\"Judging by the breadth of his shoulders, I thought he might be the\\nEnglishman of the Palace Hotel, the one who left the hotel and whose\\ntraces we lost.\"\\n\\n\"The major?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Major Parbury.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s reflection, M. Lenormand said:\\n\\n\"There is no doubt possible. There were two of them in the Kesselbach\\ncase: the man with the dagger, who committed the murders, and his\\naccomplice, the major.\"\\n\\n\"That is what Prince Sernine thinks,\" muttered Jacques Doudeville.\\n\\n\"And to-night,\" continued the chief detective, \"it is they again: the\\nsame two.\" And he added, \"So much the better. The chance of catching two\\ncriminals is a hundred times greater than the chance of catching one.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand attended to his men, had them put to bed and looked to see\\nif the assailants had dropped anything or left any traces. He found\\nnothing and went back to bed again himself.\\n\\nIn the morning, as Gourel and the Doudevilles felt none the worse for\\ntheir injuries, he told the two brothers to scour the neighborhood and\\nhimself set out with Gourel for Paris, in order to hurry matters on and\\ngive his orders.\\n\\n             *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nHe lunched in his office. At two o\\'clock, he heard good news. One of his\\nbest detectives, Dieuzy, had picked up Steinweg, Rudolf Kesselbach\\'s\\ncorrespondent, as the German was stepping out of a train from\\nMarseilles.\\n\\n\"Is Dieuzy there?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, chief,\" said Gourel. \"He\\'s here with the German.\"\\n\\n\"Have them brought in to me.\"\\n\\nAt that moment, the telephone-bell rang. It was Jean Doudeville,\\nspeaking from the post-office at Garches. The conversation did not take\\nlong:\\n\\n\"Is that you, Jean? Any news?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, chief, Major Parbury. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"We have found him. He has become a Spaniard and has darkened his skin.\\nWe have just seen him. He was entering the Garches free-school. He was\\nreceived by that young lady . . . you know, the girl who knows Prince\\nSernine, Geneviève Ernemont.\"\\n\\n\"Thunder!\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand let go the receiver, made a grab at his hat, flew into the\\npassage, met Dieuzy and the German, shouted to them to meet him in his\\noffice at six o\\'clock, rushed down the stairs, followed by Gourel and\\ntwo inspectors whom he picked up on the way, and dived into a taxi-cab:\\n\\n\"Quick as you can to Garches . . . ten francs for yourself!\"\\n\\nHe stopped the car a little before the Parc de Villeneuve, at the turn\\nof the lane that led to the school. Jean Doudeville was waiting for him\\nand at once exclaimed:\\n\\n\"He slipped away, ten minutes ago, by the other end of the lane.\"\\n\\n\"Alone?\"\\n\\n\"No, with the girl.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand took Doudeville by the collar:\\n\\n\"Wretch! You let him go! But you ought to have . . . you ought to have\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"My brother is on his track.\"\\n\\n\"A lot of good that will do us! He\\'ll stick your brother. You\\'re no\\nmatch for him, either of you!\"\\n\\nHe himself took the steering-wheel of the taxi, and resolutely drove\\ninto the lane, regardless of the cart-ruts and of the bushes on each\\nside. They soon emerged on a parish-road, which took them to a crossway\\nwhere five roads met. M. Lenormand, without hesitation chose the one on\\nthe left, the Saint-Cucufa Road. As a matter of fact, at the top of the\\nslope that runs down to the lake, they met the other Doudeville brother,\\nwho shouted:\\n\\n\"They are in a carriage . . . half a mile away.\"\\n\\nThe chief did not stop. He sent the car flying down the incline, rushed\\nalong the bends, drove round the lake and suddenly uttered an\\nexclamation of triumph. Right at the top of a little hill that stood in\\nfront of them, he had seen the hood of a carriage.\\n\\nUnfortunately, he had taken the wrong road and had to back the machine.\\nWhen he reached the place where the roads branched, the carriage was\\nstill there, stationary. And, suddenly, while he was turning, he saw a\\ngirl spring from the carriage. A man appeared on the step. The girl\\nstretched out her arm. Two reports rang out.\\n\\nShe had taken bad aim, without a doubt, for a head looked round the\\nother side of the hood and the man, catching sight of the motor-cab,\\ngave his horse a great lash with the whip and it started off at a\\ngallop. The next moment, a turn of the road hid the carriage from sight.\\n\\nM. Lenormand finished his tacking in a few seconds, darted straight up\\nthe incline, passed the girl without stopping and turned round boldly.\\nHe found himself on a steep, pebbly forest road, which ran down between\\ndense woods and which could only be followed very slowly and with the\\ngreatest caution. But what did he care! Twenty yards in front of him,\\nthe carriage, a sort of two-wheeled cabriolet, was dancing over the\\nstones, drawn, or rather held back, by a horse which knew enough only to\\ngo very carefully, feeling its way and taking no risks. There was\\nnothing to fear; escape was impossible.\\n\\nAnd the two conveyances went shaking and jolting down-hill. At one\\nmoment, they were so close together that M. Lenormand thought of\\nalighting and running with his men. But he felt the danger of putting on\\nthe brake on so steep a slope; and he went on, pressing the enemy\\nclosely, like a prey which one keeps within sight, within touch. . . .\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got him, chief, we\\'ve got him!\" muttered the inspectors, excited\\nby the unexpected nature of the chase.\\n\\nAt the bottom, the way flattened out into a road that ran towards the\\nSeine, towards Bougival. The horse, on reaching level ground, set off at\\na jog-trot, without hurrying itself and keeping to the middle of the\\nroad.\\n\\nA violent effort shook the taxi. It appeared, instead of rolling, to\\nproceed by bounds, like a darting fawn, and, slipping by the roadside\\nslope, ready to smash any obstacle, it caught up the carriage, came\\nlevel with it, passed it. . . .\\n\\nAn oath from M. Lenormand . . . shouts of fury. . . . The carriage was\\nempty!\\n\\nThe carriage was empty. The horse was going along peacefully, with the\\nreins on its back, no doubt returning to the stable of some inn in the\\nneighborhood, where it had been hired for the day. . . .\\n\\nSuppressing his inward rage, the chief detective merely said:\\n\\n\"The major must have jumped out during the few seconds when we lost\\nsight of the carriage, at the top of the descent.\"\\n\\n\"We have only to beat the woods, chief, and we are sure . . .\"\\n\\n\"To return empty-handed. The beggar is far away by this time. He\\'s not\\none of those who are caught twice in one day. Oh, hang it all, hang it\\nall!\"\\n\\nThey went back to the young girl, whom they found in the company of\\nJacques Doudeville and apparently none the worse for her adventure. M.\\nLenormand introduced himself, offered to take her back home and at once\\nquestioned her about the English major, Parbury.\\n\\nShe expressed astonishment:\\n\\n\"He is neither English nor a major; and his name is not Parbury.\"\\n\\n\"Then what is his name?\"\\n\\n\"Juan Ribeira. He is a Spaniard sent by his government to study the\\nworking of the French schools.\"\\n\\n\"As you please. His name and his nationality are of no importance. He is\\nthe man we are looking for. Have you known him long?\"\\n\\n\"A fortnight or so. He had heard about a school which I have founded at\\nGarches and he interested himself in my experiment to the extent of\\nproposing to make me an annual grant, on the one condition that he might\\ncome from time to time to observe the progress of my pupils. I had not\\nthe right to refuse. . . .\"\\n\\n\"No, of course not; but you should have consulted your acquaintances. Is\\nnot Prince Sernine a friend of yours? He is a man of good counsel.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I have the greatest confidence in him; but he is abroad at\\npresent.\"\\n\\n\"Did you not know his address?\"\\n\\n\"No. And, besides, what could I have said to him? That gentleman behaved\\nvery well. It was not until to-day . . . But I don\\'t know if . . .\"\\n\\n\"I beg you, mademoiselle, speak frankly. You can have confidence in me\\nalso.\"\\n\\n\"Well, M. Ribeira came just now. He told me that he had been sent by a\\nFrench lady who was paying a short visit to Bougival, that this lady\\nhad a little girl whose education she would like to entrust to me and\\nthat she wished me to come and see her without delay. The thing seemed\\nquite natural. And, as this is a holiday and as M. Ribeira had hired a\\ncarriage which was waiting for him at the end of the road, I made no\\ndifficulty about accepting a seat in it.\"\\n\\n\"But what was his object, after all?\"\\n\\nShe blushed and said:\\n\\n\"To carry me off, quite simply. He confessed it to me after half an\\nhour. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Do you know nothing about him?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Does he live in Paris?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose so.\"\\n\\n\"Has he ever written to you? Do you happen to have a few lines in his\\nhandwriting, anything which he left behind, that may serve us as a\\nclue?\"\\n\\n\"No clue at all. . . . Oh, wait a minute . . . but I don\\'t think that\\nhas any importance. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Speak, speak . . . please. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Well, two days ago, the gentleman asked permission to use my\\ntypewriting machine; and he typed out--with difficulty, for he evidently\\nhad no practice--a letter of which I saw the address by accident.\"\\n\\n\"What was the address?\"\\n\\n\"He was writing to the _Journal_ and he put about twenty stamps into the\\nenvelope.\"\\n\\n\"Yes . . . the agony-column, no doubt,\" said M. Lenormand.\\n\\n\"I have to-day\\'s number with me, chief,\" said Gourel.\\n\\nM. Lenormand unfolded the sheet and looked at the eighth page.\\nPresently, he gave a start. He had read the following sentence, printed\\nwith the usual abbreviation:[4]\\n\\n      \"To any person knowing Mr. Steinweg. Advertiser wishes\\n      to know if he is in Paris and his address. Reply\\n      through this column.\"\\n\\n[Footnote 4: Personal advertisements in the French newspapers are\\ncharged by the line, not by the word; and consequently nearly every word\\nis clipped down to two, three or four letters.--_Translator\\'s Note._]\\n\\n\"Steinweg!\" exclaimed Gourel. \"But that\\'s the very man whom Dieuzy is\\nbringing to you!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" said M. Lenormand, to himself, \"it\\'s the man whose letter to\\nMr. Kesselbach I intercepted, the man who put Kesselbach on the track of\\nPierre Leduc. . . . So they, too, want particulars about Pierre Leduc\\nand his past? . . . They, too, are groping in the dark? . . .\"\\n\\nHe rubbed his hands: Steinweg was at his disposal. In less than an hour,\\nSteinweg would have spoken. In less than an hour, the murky veil which\\noppressed him and which made the Kesselbach case the most agonizing and\\nthe most impenetrable that he had ever had in hand: that veil would be\\ntorn asunder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nM. LENORMAND SUCCUMBS\\n\\n\\nM. Lenormand was back in his room at the Prefecture of Police at six\\no\\'clock in the evening. He at once sent for Dieuzy:\\n\\n\"Is your man here?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, chief.\"\\n\\n\"How far have you got with him?\"\\n\\n\"Not very. He won\\'t speak a word. I told him that, by a new regulation,\\nforeigners were \\'bliged to make a declaration at the Prefecture as to\\nthe object and the probable length of their stay in Paris; and I brought\\nhim here, to your secretary\\'s office.\"\\n\\n\"I will question him.\"\\n\\nBut, at that moment, an office-messenger appeared:\\n\\n\"There\\'s a lady asking to see you at once, chief.\"\\n\\n\"Have you her card?\"\\n\\n\"Here, chief.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Kesselbach! Show her in.\"\\n\\nHe walked across the room to receive the young widow at the door and\\nbegged her to take a seat. She still wore the same disconsolate look,\\nthe same appearance of illness and that air of extreme lassitude which\\nrevealed the distress of her life.\\n\\nShe held out a copy of the _Journal_ and pointed to the line in the\\nagony-column which mentioned Steinweg:\\n\\n\"Old Steinweg was a friend of my husband\\'s,\" she said, \"and I have no\\ndoubt that he knows a good many things.\"\\n\\n\"Dieuzy,\" said M. Lenormand, \"bring the person who is waiting. . . .\\nYour visit, madame, will not have been useless. I will only ask you,\\nwhen this person enters, not to say a word.\"\\n\\nThe door opened. A man appeared, an old man with white whiskers meeting\\nunder his chin and a face furrowed with deep wrinkles, poorly clad and\\nwearing the hunted look of those wretches who roam about the world in\\nsearch of their daily pittance.\\n\\nHe stood on the threshold, blinking his eyelids, stared at M. Lenormand,\\nseemed confused by the silence that greeted him on his entrance and\\nturned his hat in his hands with embarrassment.\\n\\nBut, suddenly, he appeared stupefied, his eyes opened wide and he\\nstammered:\\n\\n\"Mrs. . . . Mrs. Kesselbach!\"\\n\\nHe had seen the young widow. And, recovering his serenity, smiling,\\nlosing his shyness, he went up to her and in a strong German accent:\\n\\n\"Oh, I am glad! . . . At last! . . . I thought I should never . . . I\\nwas so surprised to receive no news down there . . . no telegrams. . . .\\nAnd how is our dear Rudolf Kesselbach?\"\\n\\nThe lady staggered back, as though she had been struck in the face, and\\nat once fell into a chair and began to sob.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter? . . . Why, what\\'s the matter?\" asked Steinweg.\\n\\nM. Lenormand interposed:\\n\\n\"I see, sir, that you know nothing about certain events that have taken\\nplace recently. Have you been long travelling?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, three months. . . . I had been up to the Rand. Then I went back to\\nCapetown and wrote to Rudolf from there. But, on my way home by the East\\nCoast route, I accepted some work at Port Said. Rudolf has had my\\nletter, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"He is away. I will explain the reason of his absence. But, first, there\\nis a point on which we should be glad of some information. It has to do\\nwith a person whom you knew and to whom you used to refer, in your\\nintercourse with Mr. Kesselbach, by the name of Pierre Leduc.\"\\n\\n\"Pierre Leduc! What! Who told you?\"\\n\\nThe old man was utterly taken aback.\\n\\nHe spluttered out again:\\n\\n\"Who told you? Who disclosed to you . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Kesselbach.\"\\n\\n\"Never! It was a secret which I confided to him and Rudolf keeps his\\nsecrets . . . especially this one . . .\"\\n\\n\"Nevertheless, it is absolutely necessary that you should reply to our\\nquestions. We are at this moment engaged on an inquiry about Pierre\\nLeduc which must come to a head without delay; and you alone can\\nenlighten us, as Mr. Kesselbach is no longer here.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then,\" cried Steinweg, apparently making up his mind, \"what do\\nyou want?\"\\n\\n\"Do you know Pierre Leduc?\"\\n\\n\"I have never seen him, but I have long been the possessor of a secret\\nwhich concerns him. Through a number of incidents which I need not\\nrelate and thanks to a series of chances, I ended by acquiring the\\ncertainty that the man in whose discovery I was interested was leading a\\ndissolute life in Paris and that he was calling himself Pierre Leduc,\\nwhich is not his real name.\"\\n\\n\"But does he know his real name himself?\"\\n\\n\"I presume so.\"\\n\\n\"And you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, tell it to us.\"\\n\\nHe hesitated; then, vehemently:\\n\\n\"I can\\'t,\" he said. \"No, I can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"But why not?\"\\n\\n\"I have no right to. The whole secret lies there. When I revealed the\\nsecret to Rudolf, he attached so much importance to it that he gave me a\\nlarge sum of money to purchase my silence and he promised me a fortune,\\na real fortune, on the day when he should succeed, first, in finding\\nPierre Leduc and, next, in turning the secret to account.\" He smiled\\nbitterly. \"The large sum of money is already lost. I came to see how my\\nfortune was getting on.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Kesselbach is dead,\" said the chief detective.\\n\\nSteinweg gave a bound:\\n\\n\"Dead! Is it possible? No, it\\'s a trap. Mrs. Kesselbach, is it true?\"\\n\\nShe bowed her head.\\n\\nHe seemed crushed by this unexpected revelation; and, at the same time,\\nit must have been infinitely painful to him, for he began to cry:\\n\\n\"My poor Rudolf, I knew him when he was a little boy. . . . He used to\\ncome and play at my house at Augsburg. . . . I was very fond of him.\"\\nAnd, calling Mrs. Kesselbach to witness, \"And he of me, was he not, Mrs.\\nKesselbach? He must have told you. . . . His old Daddy Steinweg, he used\\nto call me.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand went up to him and, in his clearest voice:\\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" he said. \"Mr. Kesselbach died murdered. . . . Come, be\\ncalm . . . exclamations are of no use. . . . He died murdered, I say,\\nand all the circumstances of the crime prove that the culprit knew about\\nthe scheme in question. Was there anything in the nature of that scheme\\nthat would enable you to guess . . . ?\"\\n\\nSteinweg stood dumfounded. He stammered:\\n\\n\"It was my fault. . . . If I had not suggested the thing to him . . .\"\\n\\nMrs. Kesselbach went up to him, entreating him:\\n\\n\"Do you think . . . have you any idea? . . . Oh, Steinweg, I implore\\nyou! . . .\"\\n\\n\"I have no idea. . . . I have not reflected,\" he muttered. \"I must have\\ntime to reflect. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Cast about in Mr. Kesselbach\\'s surroundings,\" said M. Lenormand. \"Did\\nnobody take part in your interviews at that time? Was there nobody in\\nwhom he himself could have confided?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Think well.\"\\n\\nBoth the others, Dolores and M. Lenormand, leant toward him, anxiously\\nawaiting his answer.\\n\\n\"No,\" he said, \"I don\\'t see. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Think well,\" repeated the chief detective. \"The murderer\\'s Christian\\nname and surname begin with an L and an M.\"\\n\\n\"An L,\" he echoed. \"I don\\'t see . . . an L . . . an M. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, the initials are in gold on the corner of a cigarette-case\\nbelonging to the murderer.\"\\n\\n\"A cigarette-case?\" asked Steinweg, making an effort of memory.\\n\\n\"A gun-metal case . . . and one of the compartments is divided into two\\nspaces, the smaller for cigarette-papers, the other for tobacco. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Two spaces, two spaces,\" repeated Steinweg, whose thoughts seemed\\nstimulated by that detail. \"Couldn\\'t you show it to me?\"\\n\\n\"Here it is, or rather this is an exact reproduction,\" said M.\\nLenormand, giving him a cigarette-case.\\n\\n\"Eh! What!\" said Steinweg, taking the case in his hands.\\n\\nHe looked at it with stupid eyes, examined it, turned it over in every\\ndirection and, suddenly, gave a cry, the cry of a man struck with a\\nhorrible idea. And he stood like that, livid, with trembling hands and\\nwild, staring eyes.\\n\\n\"Speak, come, speak!\" said M. Lenormand.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" he said, as though blinded with light, \"now all is explained!\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"Speak, speak!\"\\n\\nHe walked across to the windows with a tottering step, then returned\\nand, rushing up to the chief detective:\\n\\n\"Sir, sir . . . Rudolf\\'s murderer . . . I\\'ll tell you. . . . Well . . .\"\\n\\nHe stopped short.\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\nThere was a moment\\'s pause. . . . Was the name of the odious criminal\\nabout to echo through the great silence of the office, between those\\nwalls which had heard so many accusations, so many confessions? M.\\nLenormand felt as if he were on the brink of the unfathomable abyss and\\nas if a voice were mounting, mounting up to him. . . . A few seconds\\nmore and he would know. . . .\\n\\n\"No,\" muttered Steinweg, \"no, I can\\'t. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that you say?\" cried the chief detective, furiously.\\n\\n\"I say that I can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"But you have no right to be silent. The law requires you to speak.\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow. . . . I will speak to-morrow . . . I must have time to\\nreflect. . . . To-morrow, I will tell you all that I know about Pierre\\nLeduc . . . all that I suppose about that cigarette-case. . . .\\nTo-morrow, I promise you. . . .\"\\n\\nIt was obvious that he possessed that sort of obstinacy against which\\nthe most energetic efforts are of no avail. M. Lenormand yielded:\\n\\n\"Very well. I give you until to-morrow, but I warn you that, if you do\\nnot speak to-morrow, I shall be obliged to go to the\\nexamining-magistrate.\"\\n\\nHe rang and, taking Inspector Dieuzy aside, said:\\n\\n\"Go with him to his hotel . . . and stay there. . . . I\\'ll send you two\\nmen. . . . And mind you keep your eyes about you. Somebody may try to\\nget hold of him.\"\\n\\nThe inspector went off with Steinweg; and M. Lenormand, returning to\\nMrs. Kesselbach, who had been violently affected by this scene, made his\\nexcuses.\\n\\n\"Pray accept all my regrets, madame. . . . I can understand how upset\\nyou must feel. . . .\"\\n\\nHe questioned her as to the period at which Mr. Kesselbach renewed his\\nrelations with old Steinweg and as to the length of time for which those\\nrelations lasted. But she was so much worn-out that he did not insist.\\n\\n\"Am I to come back to-morrow?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s not necessary. I will let you know all that Steinweg says. May\\nI see you down to your carriage? These three flights are rather steep.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nHe opened the door and stood back to let her pass. At that moment shouts\\nwere heard in the passage and people came running up, inspectors on\\nduty, office-messengers, clerks:\\n\\n\"Chief! Chief!\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\n\"Dieuzy! . . .\"\\n\\n\"But he\\'s just left here. . . .\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s been found on the staircase. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Not dead? . . .\"\\n\\n\"No, stunned, fainting. . . .\"\\n\\n\"But the man . . . the man who was with him . . . old Steinweg?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s disappeared. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Damn it!\"\\n\\nHe rushed along the passage and down the stairs, where he found Dieuzy\\nlying on the first-floor landing, surrounded by people who were\\nattending to him.\\n\\nHe saw Gourel coming up again:\\n\\n\"Oh, Gourel, have you been downstairs? Did you come across anybody?\"\\n\\n\"No, chief. . . .\"\\n\\nBut Dieuzy was recovering consciousness and, almost before he had opened\\nhis eyes, mumbled:\\n\\n\"Here, on the landing, the little door. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh, hang it, the door of Court 7!\"[5] shouted the chief detective.\\n\"Didn\\'t I say that it was to be kept locked? . . . It was certain that,\\nsooner or later . . .\" He seized the door-handle. \"Oh, of course! The\\ndoor is bolted on the other side now!\"\\n\\n[Footnote 5: Since M. Lenormand left the detective service, two other\\ncriminals have escaped by the same door, after shaking off the officers\\nin charge of them; the police kept both cases dark. Nevertheless, it\\nwould be very easy, if this communication is absolutely required, to\\nremove the useless bolt on the other side of the door, which enables the\\nfugitive to cut off all pursuit and to walk away quietly through the\\npassage leading to Civil Court 7 and through the corridor of the Chief\\nPresident\\'s Court.]\\n\\nThe door was partly glazed. He smashed a pane with the butt-end of his\\nrevolver, drew the bolt and said to Gourel:\\n\\n\"Run through this way to the exit on the Place Dauphine. . . .\"\\n\\nHe went back to Dieuzy:\\n\\n\"Come, Dieuzy, tell me about it. How did you come to let yourself be put\\ninto this state?\"\\n\\n\"A blow in the pit of the stomach, chief. . . .\"\\n\\n\"A blow? From that old chap? . . . Why, he can hardly stand on his legs!\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"Not the old man, chief, but another, who was walking up and down the\\npassage while Steinweg was with you and who followed us as though he\\nwere going out, too. . . . When we got as far as this, he asked me for a\\nlight. . . . I looked for my matches . . . Then he caught me a punch in\\nthe stomach. . . . I fell down, and, as I fell, I thought I saw him open\\nthat door and drag the old man with him. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Would you know him again?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, chief . . . a powerful fellow, very dark-skinned . . . a\\nsoutherner of sorts, that\\'s certain. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Ribeira,\" snarled M. Lenormand. \"Always Ribeira! . . . Ribeira, _alias_\\nParbury. . . . Oh, the impudence of the scoundrel! He was afraid of what\\nold Steinweg might say . . . and came to fetch him away under my very\\nnose!\" And, stamping his foot with anger, \"But, dash it, how did he know\\nthat Steinweg was here, the blackguard! It\\'s only four hours since I was\\nchasing him in the Saint-Cucufa woods . . . and now he\\'s here! . . . How\\ndid he know? . . . One would think he lived inside my skin! . . .\"\\n\\nHe was seized with one of those fits of dreaming in which he seemed to\\nhear nothing and see nothing. Mrs. Kesselbach, who passed at that\\nmoment, bowed without his replying.\\n\\nBut a sound of footsteps in the corridor roused him from his lethargy.\\n\\n\"At last, is that you, Gourel?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve found out how it was, chief,\" said Gourel, panting for breath.\\n\"There were two of them. They went this way and out of the Place\\nDauphine. There was a motor-car waiting for them. There were two people\\ninside: one was a man dressed in black, with a soft hat pulled over his\\neyes . . .\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s he,\" muttered M. Lenormand, \"that\\'s the murderer, the accomplice\\nof Ribeira,--Parbury. And who was the other?\"\\n\\n\"A woman, a woman without a hat, a servant-girl, it might be. . . . And\\ngood-looking, I\\'m told, with red hair.\"\\n\\n\"Eh, what! You say she had red hair?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand turned round with a bound, ran down the stairs four steps\\nat a time, hurried across the courtyard and came out on the Quai des\\nOrfèvres:\\n\\n\"Stop!\" he shouted.\\n\\nA victoria and pair was driving off. It was Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s carriage.\\nThe coachman heard and pulled up his horses. M. Lenormand sprang on the\\nstep:\\n\\n\"I beg a thousand pardons, madame, but I cannot do without your\\nassistance. I will ask you to let me go with you. . . . But we must act\\nswiftly. . . . Gourel, where\\'s my taxi?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve sent it away, chief.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, get another, quick!\" . . .\\n\\nThe men all ran in different directions. But ten minutes elapsed before\\none of them returned with a motor-cab. M. Lenormand was boiling with\\nimpatience. Mrs. Kesselbach, standing on the pavement, swayed from side\\nto side, with her smelling-salts in her hand.\\n\\nAt last they were seated.\\n\\n\"Gourel, get up beside the driver and go straight to Garches.\"\\n\\n\"To my house?\" asked Dolores, astounded.\\n\\nHe did not reply. He leant out of the window, waved his pass, explained\\nwho he was to the policeman regulating the traffic in the streets. At\\nlast, when they reached the Cours-la-Reine, he sat down again and said:\\n\\n\"I beseech you, madame, to give me plain answers to my questions. Did\\nyou see Mlle. Geneviève Ernemont just now, at about four o\\'clock?\"\\n\\n\"Geneviève? . . . Yes. . . . I was dressing to go out.\"\\n\\n\"Did she tell you of the advertisement about Steinweg in the _Journal_?\"\\n\\n\"She did.\"\\n\\n\"And it was that which made you come to see me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Were you alone during Mlle. Ernemont\\'s visit?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I can\\'t say. . . . Why?\"\\n\\n\"Recollect. Was one of your servants present?\"\\n\\n\"Probably . . . as I was dressing. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What are their names?\"\\n\\n\"Suzanne and Gertrude.\"\\n\\n\"One of them has red hair, has she not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Gertrude.\"\\n\\n\"Have you known her long?\"\\n\\n\"Her sister has always been with me . . . and so has Gertrude, for\\nyears. . . . She is devotion and honesty personified. . . .\"\\n\\n\"In short, you will answer for her?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, absolutely!\"\\n\\n\"Very well . . . very well.\"\\n\\nIt was half-past seven and the daylight was beginning to wane when the\\ntaxi-cab reached the House of Retreat. Without troubling about his\\ncompanion, the chief detective rushed into the porter\\'s lodge:\\n\\n\"Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s maid has just come in, has she not?\"\\n\\n\"Whom do you mean, the maid?\"\\n\\n\"Why, Gertrude, one of the two sisters.\"\\n\\n\"But Gertrude can\\'t have been out, sir. We haven\\'t seen her go out.\"\\n\\n\"Still some one has just come in.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, we haven\\'t opened the door to anybody since--let me see--six\\no\\'clock this evening.\"\\n\\n\"Is there no other way out than this gate?\"\\n\\n\"No. The walls surround the estate on every side and they are very high.\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Kesselbach, we will go to your house, please.\"\\n\\nThey all three went. Mrs. Kesselbach, who had no key, rang. The door was\\nanswered by Suzanne, the other sister.\\n\\n\"Is Gertrude in?\" asked Mrs. Kesselbach.\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, in her room.\"\\n\\n\"Send her down, please,\" said the chief detective.\\n\\nAfter a moment, Gertrude came downstairs, looking very attractive and\\nengaging in her white embroidered apron.\\n\\nShe had, in point of fact, a rather pretty face, crowned with red hair.\\n\\nM. Lenormand looked at her for a long time without speaking, as though\\nhe were trying to read what lay behind those innocent eyes.\\n\\nHe asked her no questions. After a minute, he simply said:\\n\\n\"That will do, thank you. Come, Gourel.\"\\n\\nHe went out with the sergeant and, at once, as they followed the\\ndarkling paths of the garden, said:\\n\\n\"That\\'s the one!\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so, chief? She looked so placid!\"\\n\\n\"Much too placid. Another would have been astonished, would have wanted\\nto know why I sent for her. Not this one! Nothing but the concentrated\\neffort of a face that is determined to smile at all costs. Only, I saw a\\ndrop of perspiration trickle from her temple along her ear.\"\\n\\n\"So that . . . ?\\n\\n\"So that everything becomes plain. Gertrude is in league with the two\\nruffians who are conspiring round the Kesselbach case, in order either\\nto discover and carry out the famous scheme, or to capture the widow\\'s\\nmillions. No doubt, the other sister is in the plot as well. At four\\no\\'clock, Gertrude, learning that I know of the advertisement in the\\n_Journal_, takes advantage of her mistress\\'s absence, hastens to Paris,\\nfinds Ribeira and the man in the soft hat and drags them off to the\\nPalais, where Ribeira annexes Master Steinweg for his own purposes.\"\\n\\nHe reflected and concluded:\\n\\n\"All this proves, first, the importance which they attach to Steinweg\\nand their fear of what he may reveal; secondly, that a regular plot is\\nbeing hatched around Mrs. Kesselbach; thirdly, that I have no time to\\nlose, for the plot is ripe.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Gourel, \"but one thing remains unexplained. How was\\nGertrude able to leave the garden in which we now are and to enter it\\nagain, unknown to the porter and his wife?\"\\n\\n\"Through a secret passage which the rogues must have contrived to make\\nquite recently.\"\\n\\n\"And which would end, no doubt,\" said Gourel, \"in Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s\\nhouse.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, perhaps,\" said M. Lenormand, \"perhaps . . . But I have another\\nidea.\"\\n\\nThey followed the circuit of the wall. It was a bright night; and,\\nthough their two forms were hardly distinguishable, they themselves\\ncould see enough to examine the stones of the walls and to convince\\nthemselves that no breach, however skilful, had been effected.\\n\\n\"A ladder, very likely?\" suggested Gourel.\\n\\n\"No, because Gertrude is able to get out in broad daylight. A\\ncommunication of the kind I mean can evidently not end out of doors. The\\nentrance must be concealed by some building already in existence.\"\\n\\n\"There are only the four garden-houses,\" objected Gourel, \"and they are\\nall inhabited.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon: the third, the Pavillon Hortense, is not inhabited.\"\\n\\n\"Who told you so?\"\\n\\n\"The porter. Mrs. Kesselbach hired this house, which is near her own,\\nfor fear of the noise. Who knows but that, in so doing, she acted under\\nGertrude\\'s influence?\"\\n\\nHe walked round the house in question. The shutters were closed. He\\nlifted the latch of the door, on the off-chance; the door opened.\\n\\n\"Ah, Gourel, I think we\\'ve struck it! Let\\'s go in. Light your lantern.\\n. . . Oh, the hall. . . . the drawing-room . . . the dining-room . . .\\nthat\\'s no use. There must be a basement, as the kitchen is not on this\\nfloor.\"\\n\\n\"This way, chief . . . the kitchen-stairs are here.\"\\n\\nThey went down into a rather large kitchen, crammed full of wicker-work\\ngarden-chairs and flower-stands. Beside it was a wash-house, which also\\nserved as a cellar, and which presented the same untidy sight of objects\\npiled one on the top of the other.\\n\\n\"What is that shiny thing down there, chief?\"\\n\\nGourel stooped and picked up a brass pin with a head made of an\\nimitation pearl.\\n\\n\"The pearl is quite bright still,\" said M. Lenormand, \"which it would\\nnot be if it had been lying in this cellar long. Gertrude passed this\\nway, Gourel.\"\\n\\nGourel began to demolish a great stack of empty wine-casks, writing\\ndesks and old rickety tables.\\n\\n\"You are wasting your time,\" said M. Lenormand. \"If that is the way out,\\nhow would she have time first to move all those things and then to\\nreplace them behind her? Look, here is a shutter out of use, which has\\nno valid reason for being fastened to the wall by that nail. Draw it\\nback.\"\\n\\nGourel did so. Behind the shutter, the wall was hollowed out. By the\\nlight of the lantern they saw an underground passage running downwards.\\n\\n\"I was right,\" said M. Lenormand.. \"The communication is of recent date.\\nYou see, it\\'s a piece of work hurriedly done, and not intended to last\\nfor any length of time. . . . No masonry. . . . Two planks placed\\ncross-wise at intervals, with a joist to serve as a roof; and that is\\nall. It will hold up as best it may: well enough, in any case, for the\\nobject in view, that is to say . . .\"\\n\\n\"That is to say what, chief?\"\\n\\n\"Well, first to allow of the going backwards and forwards between\\nGertrude and her accomplices . . . and then, one day, one day soon, of\\nthe kidnapping, or rather the total, miraculous, incomprehensible\\ndisappearance of Mrs. Kesselbach.\"\\n\\nThey proceeded cautiously, so as not to knock against certain beams\\nwhich did not look over-safe. It at once became evident that the tunnel\\nwas much longer than the fifty yards at most that separated the house\\nfrom the boundary of the garden. It must, therefore, end at a fair\\ndistance from the walls and beyond the road that skirted the property.\\n\\n\"We are not going in the direction of Villeneuve and the lake are we?\"\\nasked Gourel.\\n\\n\"Not at all, the other way about,\" declared M. Lenormand.\\n\\nThe tunnel descended with a gentle slope. There was a step, then\\nanother; and they veered toward the right. They at once knocked up\\nagainst a door which was fitted into a rubble frame, carefully cemented.\\nM. Lenormand pushed it and it opened.\\n\\n\"One second, Gourel,\" he said, stopping. \"Let us think. . . . It might\\nperhaps be wiser to turn back.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"We must reflect that Ribeira will have foreseen the danger and presume\\nthat he has taken his precautions, in case the underground passage\\nshould be discovered. Now he knows that we are on his track. He knows\\nthat we are searching the garden. He no doubt saw us enter the house.\\nHow do I know that he is not at this moment laying a trap for us?\"\\n\\n\"There are two of us, chief. . . .\"\\n\\n\"And suppose there were twenty of them?\"\\n\\nHe looked in front of him. The tunnel sloped upward again, closed by\\nanother door, which was at five or six yards\\' distance.\\n\\n\"Let us go so far,\" he said. \"Then we shall see.\"\\n\\nHe passed through, followed by Gourel, whom he told to leave the first\\ndoor open, and walked to the other door, resolving within himself to go\\nno farther. But this second door was shut; and though the lock seemed to\\nwork, he could not succeed in opening it.\\n\\n\"The door is bolted,\" he said. \"Let us make no noise and go back. The\\nmore so as, outside, by remembering the position of the tunnel, we can\\nfix the line along which to look for the other outlet.\"\\n\\nThey therefore retraced their steps to the first door, when Gourel, who\\nwas walking ahead, gave an exclamation of surprise:\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s closed! . . .\"\\n\\n\"How is that? When I told you to leave it open!\"\\n\\n\"I did leave it open, chief, but the door must have fallen back of its\\nown weight.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible! We should have heard the sound.\"\\n\\n\"Then? . . .\"\\n\\n\"Then . . . then . . . I don\\'t know . . .\" He went up to the door.\\n\"Let\\'s see, . . . there\\'s a key . . . does it turn? . . . Yes, it turns.\\nBut there seems to be a bolt on the other side.\"\\n\\n\"Who can have fastened it?\"\\n\\n\"They, of course! Behind our backs! . . . Perhaps they have another\\ntunnel that runs above this one, alongside of it . . . or else they were\\nwaiting in that empty house. . . . In any case, we\\'re caught in a trap.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nHe grew angry with the lock, thrust his knife into the chink of the\\ndoor, tried every means and then, in a moment of weariness, said:\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing to be done!\"\\n\\n\"What, chief, nothing to be done? In that case, we\\'re diddled!\"\\n\\n\"I dare say!\" said M. Lenormand. . . .\\n\\nThey returned to the other door and came back again to the first. Both\\nwere solid, made of hard wood, strengthened with cross-beams . . . in\\nshort, indestructible.\\n\\n\"We should want a hatchet,\" said the chief of the detective-service, \"or\\nat the very least, a serious implement . . . a knife even, with which we\\nmight try to cut away the place where the bolt is most likely to be\\n. . . and we have nothing. . . .\"\\n\\nHe was seized with a sudden fit of rage and flung himself upon the\\nobstacle, as though he hoped to do away with it. Then, powerless,\\nbeaten, he said to Gourel:\\n\\n\"Listen, we\\'ll look into this in an hour or two. . . . I am tired out.\\n. . . I am going to sleep. . . . Keep watch so long . . . and if they\\ncome and attack us . . .\"\\n\\n\"Ah, if they come, we shall be saved, chief!\" cried Gourel, who would\\nhave been relieved by a fight, however great the odds.\\n\\nM. Lenormand lay down on the ground. In a minute, he was asleep.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nWhen he woke up, he remained for some seconds undecided, not\\nunderstanding; and he also asked himself what sort of pain it was that\\nwas tormenting him:\\n\\n\"Gourel!\" he called. \"Come! Gourel!\"\\n\\nObtaining no reply, he pressed the spring of his lantern and saw Gourel\\nlying beside him, sound asleep.\\n\\n\"What on earth can this pain be?\" he thought. \"Regular twitchings. . . .\\nOh, why, of course, I am hungry, that\\'s all. . . . I\\'m starving! What\\ncan the time be?\"\\n\\nHis watch marked twenty minutes past seven, but he remembered that he\\nhad not wound it up. Gourel\\'s watch was not going either.\\n\\nGourel had awoke under the action of the same inward pangs, which made\\nthem think that the breakfast-hour must be long past and that they had\\nalready slept for a part of the day.\\n\\n\"My legs are quite numbed,\" said Gourel, \"and my feet feel as if they\\nwere on ice. What a funny sensation!\" He bent down to rub them and went\\non: \"Why, it\\'s not on ice that my feet were, but in water. . . . Look,\\nchief . . . there\\'s a regular pool near the first door. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Soaked through,\" M. Lenormand replied. \"We\\'ll go back to the second\\ndoor; you can dry yourself . . .\"\\n\\n\"But what are you doing, chief?\"\\n\\n\"Do you think I am going to allow myself to be buried alive in this\\nvault? . . . Not if I know it; I haven\\'t reached the age! . . . As the\\ntwo doors are closed, let us try to pass through the walls.\"\\n\\nOne by one he loosened the stones that stood out at the height of his\\nhand, in the hope of contriving another gallery that would slope upwards\\nto the level of the soil. But the work was long and painful, for in\\nthis part of the tunnel, as he perceived the stones were cemented.\\n\\n\"Chief . . . chief,\" stammered Gourel, in a stifled voice. . . .\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"You are standing with your feet in the water.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense! . . . Why, so I am! . . . Well, it can\\'t be helped. . . .\\nI\\'ll dry them in the sun. . . .\"\\n\\n\"But don\\'t you see?\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s rising, chief, it\\'s rising! . . .\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s rising?\"\\n\\n\"The water! . . .\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand felt a shudder pass over his skin. He suddenly understood.\\nIt was not a casual trickling through, as he had thought, but a\\ncarefully-prepared flood, mechanically, irresistibly produced by some\\ninfernal system.\\n\\n\"Oh, the scoundrel!\" he snarled. \"If ever I lay hands on him . . . !\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, chief, but we must first get out of this. . . . And, as far\\nas I can see . . .\"\\n\\nGourel seemed completely prostrated, incapable of having an idea, of\\nproposing a plan.\\n\\nM. Lenormand knelt down on the ground and measured the rate at which the\\nwater was rising. A quarter, or thereabouts, of the first door was\\ncovered; and the water was half-way toward the second door.\\n\\n\"The progress is slow, but uninterrupted,\" he said \"In a few hours it\\nwill be over our heads.\"\\n\\n\"But this is terrible, chief, it\\'s horrible!\" moaned Gourel.\\n\\n\"Oh, look here, don\\'t come boring me with your lamentations, do you\\nunderstand? Cry, if it amuses you, but don\\'t let me hear you!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s the hunger that weakens me, chief; my brain\\'s going round.\"\\n\\n\"Bite your fist!\"\\n\\nAs Gourel said, the position was terrible; and, if M. Lenormand had had\\nless energy, he would have abandoned the vain struggle. What was to be\\ndone? It was no use hoping that Ribeira would have the charity to let\\nthem out. It was no use either hoping that the brothers Doudeville would\\nrescue them, for the inspectors did not know of the existence of the\\ntunnel. So no hope remained . . . no hope but that of an impossible\\nmiracle. . . .\\n\\n\"Come, come,\" said M. Lenormand, \"this is too silly. We\\'re not going to\\nkick the bucket here! Hang it all, there must be something! . . . Show\\nme a light, Gourel.\"\\n\\nFlattening himself against the second door, he examined it from top to\\nbottom, in every corner. There was an enormous bolt on that side, just\\nas there probably was on the other. He unfastened the screws with the\\nblade of his knife; and the bolt came off in his hand.\\n\\n\"And what next?\" asked Gourel.\\n\\n\"What next?\" he echoed. \"Well, this bolt is made of iron, pretty long\\nand very nearly pointed. Certainly, it\\'s not as good as a pick-axe, but\\nit\\'s better than nothing and . . .\"\\n\\nWithout finishing his sentence, he drove the implement into the\\nside-wall of the tunnel, a little in front of the pillar of masonry that\\nsupported the hinges of the door. As he expected, once he had passed the\\nfirst layer of cement and stones, he found soft earth:\\n\\n\"To work!\" he cried.\\n\\n\"Certainly, chief, but would you explain . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite simple. I want to dig round this pillar a passage, three or\\nfour yards long, which will join the tunnel on the other side of the\\ndoor and allow us to escape.\"\\n\\n\"But it will take us hours; and meanwhile, the water is rising.\"\\n\\n\"Show me a light, Gourel.\"\\n\\n\"In twenty minutes, or half an hour at most, it will have reached our\\nfeet.\"\\n\\n\"Show me a light, Gourel.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand\\'s idea was correct and, with some little exertion, by\\npulling the earth, which he first loosened with his implement, towards\\nhim and making it fall into the tunnel, he was not long in digging a\\nhole large enough to slip into.\\n\\n\"It\\'s my turn, chief!\" said Gourel.\\n\\n\"Aha, you\\'re returning to life, I see! Well, fire away! . . . You have\\nonly to follow the shape of the pillar.\"\\n\\nAt that moment, the water was up to their ankles. Would they have time\\nto complete the work begun?\\n\\nIt became more difficult as they went on, for the earth which they\\ndisturbed was in their way; and, lying flat on their stomachs in the\\npassage, they were obliged at every instant to remove the rubbish that\\nobstructed them.\\n\\nAfter two hours, the work was perhaps three-quarters through, but the\\nwater now covered their legs. Another hour and it would reach the\\nopening of the hole which they were digging. And that would mean the\\nend!\\n\\nGourel, who was exhausted by the want of food and who was too stout to\\nmove with any freedom in that ever-narrower passage, had had to give up.\\nHe no longer stirred, trembling with anguish at feeling that icy water\\nwhich was gradually swallowing him up.\\n\\nAs for M. Lenormand, he worked on with indefatigable ardor. It was a\\nterrible job, this ants\\' work performed in the stifling darkness. His\\nhands were bleeding. He was fainting with hunger. The insufficiency of\\nthe air hampered his breathing; and, from time to time, Gourel\\'s sighs\\nreminded him of the awful danger that threatened him at the bottom of\\nhis hole.\\n\\nBut nothing could discourage him, for now he again found opposite him\\nthose cemented stones which formed the side-wall of the gallery. It was\\nthe most difficult part, but the end was at hand.\\n\\n\"It\\'s rising,\" cried Gourel, in a choking voice, \"it\\'s rising!\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand redoubled his efforts. Suddenly the stem of the bolt which\\nhe was using leapt out into space. The passage was dug. He had now only\\nto widen it, which became much easier once he was able to shoot the\\nmaterials in front of him.\\n\\nGourel, mad with terror, was howling like a dying beast. M. Lenormand\\npaid no attention to him. Safety was at hand.\\n\\nNevertheless, he had a few seconds of anxiety when he perceived, by the\\nsound of the materials falling, that this part of the tunnel was also\\nunder water, which was natural, as the door did not form a sufficiently\\ntight-fitting barrier. But what did it matter! The outlet was free. One\\nlast effort . . . he passed through.\\n\\n\"Come, Gourel,\" he cried, returning to fetch his companion.\\n\\nHe dragged him, half dead, by the wrists:\\n\\n\"Come along, booby, pull yourself together! We are saved.\"\\n\\n\"Do you really think so, chief? . . . The water\\'s up to our chests.\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, as long as it\\'s not over our mouths. . . . Where\\'s your\\nlantern?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not working.\"\\n\\n\"No matter.\" He gave an exclamation of delight. \"One step . . . two\\nsteps! . . . A staircase. . . . At last!\"\\n\\nThey emerged from the water, that accursed water which had almost\\nswallowed them up; and it was a delicious sensation, a release that sent\\nup their spirits.\\n\\n\"Stop!\" said M. Lenormand.\\n\\nHis head had knocked against something. With arms outstretched, he\\npushed against the obstacle, which yielded at once. It was the flap of a\\ntrap-door; and, when this trap-door was opened, he found himself in a\\ncellar into which the light of a fine night filtered through an\\nair-hole.\\n\\nHe threw back the flap and climbed the last treads.\\n\\nThen a veil fell over his eyes. Arms seized upon him. He felt himself as\\nit were wrapped in a sheet, in a sort of sack, and then fastened with\\ncords.\\n\\n\"Now for the other one!\" said a voice.\\n\\nThe same operation must have been performed on Gourel; and the same\\nvoice said:\\n\\n\"If they call out, kill them at once. Have you your dagger?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Come along. You two, take this one . . . you two, that one. . . . No\\nlight . . . and no noise either. . . . It would be a serious matter.\\nThey\\'ve been searching the garden next door since this morning . . .\\nthere are ten or fifteen of them knocking about. . . . Go back to the\\nhouse, Gertrude, and, if the least thing happens, telephone to me in\\nParis.\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand felt that he was being lifted up and carried and, a moment\\nafter, that he was in the open air.\\n\\n\"Bring the cart nearer,\" said a voice.\\n\\nM. Lenormand heard the sound of a horse and cart.\\n\\nHe was laid out on some boards. Gourel was hoisted up beside him. The\\nhorse started at a trot.\\n\\nThe drive lasted about half an hour.\\n\\n\"Halt!\" commanded the voice. \"Lift them out. Here, driver, turn the cart\\nso that the tail touches the parapet of the bridge. . . . Good. . . . No\\nboats on the river? Sure? Then let\\'s waste no time. . . . Oh, have you\\nfastened some stones to them?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, paving-stones.\"\\n\\n\"Right away, then! Commend your soul to God, M. Lenormand, and pray for\\nme, Parbury-Ribeira, better known by the name of Baron Altenheim. Are\\nyou ready? All right? Well, here\\'s wishing you a pleasant journey, M.\\nLenormand!\"\\n\\nM. Lenormand was placed on the parapet. Someone gave him a push. He felt\\nhimself falling into space and he still heard the voice chuckling:\\n\\n\"A pleasant journey!\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTen seconds later it was Sergeant Gourel\\'s turn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nPARBURY-RIBEIRA-ALTENHEIM\\n\\n\\nThe girls were playing in the garden, under the supervision of Mlle.\\nCharlotte, Geneviève\\'s new assistant. Mme. Ernemont came out,\\ndistributed some cakes among them and then went back to the room which\\nserved as a drawing-room and parlor in one, sat down before a\\nwriting-desk and began to arrange her papers and account-books.\\n\\nSuddenly, she felt the presence of a stranger in the room. She turned\\nround in alarm:\\n\\n\"You!\" she cried. \"Where have you come from? How did you get in?\"\\n\\n\"Hush!\" said Prince Sernine. \"Listen to me and do not let us waste a\\nminute: Geneviève?\"\\n\\n\"Calling on Mrs. Kesselbach.\"\\n\\n\"When will she be here?\"\\n\\n\"Not before an hour.\"\\n\\n\"Then I will let the brothers Doudeville come. I have an appointment\\nwith them. How is Geneviève?\"\\n\\n\"Very well.\"\\n\\n\"How often has she seen Pierre Leduc since I went away, ten days ago?\"\\n\\n\"Three times; and she is to meet him to-day at Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s, to\\nwhom she introduced him, as you said she must. Only, I may as well tell\\nyou that I don\\'t think much of this Pierre Leduc of yours. Geneviève\\nwould do better to find some good fellow in her own class of life. For\\ninstance, there\\'s the schoolmaster.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re mad! Geneviève marry a schoolmaster!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, if you considered Geneviève\\'s happiness first. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Shut up, Victoire. You\\'re boring me with your cackle. I have no time to\\nwaste on sentiment. I\\'m playing a game of chess; and I move my men\\nwithout troubling about what they think. When I have won the game, I\\nwill go into the question whether the knight, Pierre Leduc, and the\\nqueen, Geneviève, have a heart or not.\"\\n\\nShe interrupted him:\\n\\n\"Did you hear? A whistle. . . .\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s the two Doudevilles. Go and bring them in; and then leave us.\"\\n\\nAs soon as the two brothers were in the room, he questioned them with\\nhis usual precision:\\n\\n\"I know what the newspapers have said about the disappearance of\\nLenormand and Gourel. Do you know any more?\"\\n\\n\"No. The deputy-chief, M. Weber, has taken the case in hand. We have\\nbeen searching the garden of the House of Retreat for the past week; and\\nnobody is able to explain how they can have disappeared. The whole force\\nis in a flutter. . . . No one has ever seen the like . . . a chief of\\nthe detective-service disappearing, without leaving a trace behind him!\"\\n\\n\"The two maids?\"\\n\\n\"Gertrude has gone. She is being looked for.\"\\n\\n\"Her sister Suzanne?\"\\n\\n\"M. Weber and M. Formerie have questioned her. There is nothing against\\nher.\"\\n\\n\"Is that all you have to tell me?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, there are other things, all the things which we did not tell\\nthe papers.\"\\n\\nThey then described the incidents that had marked M. Lenormand\\'s last\\ntwo days: the night visit of the two ruffians to Pierre Leduc\\'s villa;\\nnext day, Ribeira\\'s attempt to kidnap Geneviève and the chase through\\nthe Saint-Cucufa woods; old Steinweg\\'s arrival, his examination at the\\ndetective-office in Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s presence, his escape from the\\nPalais. . . .\\n\\n\"And no one knows these details except yourselves?\"\\n\\n\"Dieuzy knows about the Steinweg incident: he told us of it.\"\\n\\n\"And they still trust you at the Prefecture of Police?\"\\n\\n\"So much so that they employ us openly. M. Weber swears by us.\"\\n\\n\"Come,\" said the prince, \"all is not lost. If M. Lenormand has committed\\nan imprudence that has cost him his life, as I suppose he did, at any\\nrate he performed some good work first; and we have only to continue it.\\nThe enemy has the start of us, but we will catch him up.\"\\n\\n\"It won\\'t be an easy job, governor.\"\\n\\n\"Why not? It is only a matter of finding old Steinweg again, for the\\nanswer to the riddle is in his hands.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but where has Ribeira got old Steinweg tucked away?\"\\n\\n\"At his own place, of course.\"\\n\\n\"Then we should have to know where Ribeira hangs out.\"\\n\\n\"Well, of course!\"\\n\\nHe dismissed them and went to the House of Retreat. Motor-cars were\\nawaiting outside the door and two men were walking up and down, as\\nthough mounting guard.\\n\\nIn the garden, near Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s house, he saw Geneviève sitting on\\na bench with Pierre Leduc and a thick-set gentleman wearing a single\\neye-glass. The three were talking and none of them saw him. But several\\npeople came out of the house: M. Formerie, M. Weber, a magistrate\\'s\\nclerk, and two inspectors. Geneviève went indoors and the gentleman with\\nthe eye-glass went up and spoke to the examining-magistrate and the\\ndeputy-chief of the detective-service and walked away with them slowly.\\n\\nSernine came beside the bench where Pierre Leduc was sitting and\\nwhispered:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t move, Pierre Leduc; it\\'s I.\"\\n\\n\"You! . . . you! . . .\"\\n\\nIt was the third time that the young man saw Sernine since the awful\\nnight at Versailles; and each time it upset him.\\n\\n\"Tell me . . . who is the fellow with the eye-glass?\"\\n\\nPierre Leduc turned pale and jabbered. Sernine pinched his arm:\\n\\n\"Answer me, confound it! Who is he?\"\\n\\n\"Baron Altenheim.\"\\n\\n\"Where does he come from?\"\\n\\n\"He was a friend of Mr. Kesselbach\\'s. He arrived from Austria, six days\\nago, and placed himself at Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s disposal.\"\\n\\nThe police authorities had, meanwhile, gone out of the garden; Baron\\nAltenheim also.\\n\\nThe prince rose and, turning towards the Pavillon de l\\'Impératrice,\\ncontinued:\\n\\n\"Has the baron asked you many questions?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a great many. He is interested in my case. He wants to help me\\nfind my family. He appealed to my childhood memories.\"\\n\\n\"And what did you say?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, because I know nothing. What memories have I? You put me in\\nanother\\'s place and I don\\'t even know who that other is.\"\\n\\n\"No more do I!\" chuckled the prince. \"And that\\'s just what makes your\\ncase so quaint.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s all very well for you to laugh . . . you\\'re always laughing!\\n. . . But I\\'m beginning to have enough of it. . . . I\\'m mixed up in a\\nheap of nasty matters . . . to say nothing of the danger which I run in\\npretending to be somebody that I am not.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean . . . that you are not? You\\'re quite as much a duke as\\nI am a prince . . . perhaps even more so. . . . Besides, if you\\'re not a\\nduke, hurry up and become one, hang it all! Geneviève can\\'t marry any\\none but a duke! Look at her: isn\\'t she worth selling your soul for?\"\\n\\nHe did not even look at Leduc, not caring what he thought. They had\\nreached the house by this time; and Geneviève appeared at the foot of\\nthe steps, comely and smiling:\\n\\n\"So you have returned?\" she said to the prince. \"Ah, that\\'s a good\\nthing! I am so glad. . . . Do you want to see Dolores?\"\\n\\nAfter a moment, she showed him into Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s room. The prince\\nwas taken aback. Dolores was paler still and thinner than on the day\\nwhen he saw her last. Lying on a sofa, wrapped up in white stuffs, she\\nlooked like one of those sick people who have ceased to struggle against\\ndeath. As for her, she had ceased to struggle against life, against the\\nfate that was overwhelming her with its blows.\\n\\nSernine gazed at her with deep pity and with an emotion which he did not\\nstrive to conceal. She thanked him for the sympathy which he showed her.\\nShe also spoke of Baron Altenheim, in friendly terms.\\n\\n\"Did you know him before?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes, by name, and through his intimacy with my husband.\"\\n\\n\"I have met an Altenheim who lives in the Rue de Rivoli. Do you think\\nit\\'s the same?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, this one lives in . . . As a matter of fact, I don\\'t quite\\nknow; he gave me his address, but I can\\'t say that I remember it. . . .\"\\n\\nAfter a few minutes\\' conversation, Sernine took his leave. Geneviève was\\nwaiting for him in the hall:\\n\\n\"I want to speak to you,\" she said eagerly, \"on a serious matter. . . .\\nDid you see him?\"\\n\\n\"Whom?\"\\n\\n\"Baron Altenheim. . . . But that\\'s not his name . . . or, at least, he\\nhas another. . . . I recognized him . . . he does not know it.\"\\n\\nShe dragged him out of doors and walked on in great excitement.\\n\\n\"Calm yourself, Geneviève. . . .\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s the man who tried to carry me off. . . . But for that poor M.\\nLenormand, I should have been done for. . . . Come, you must know, for\\nyou know everything. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Then his real name is . . .\"\\n\\n\"Ribeira.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n\"It was no use his changing his appearance, his accent, his manner: I\\nknew him at once, by the horror with which he inspires me. But I said\\nnothing . . . until you returned.\"\\n\\n\"You said nothing to Mrs. Kesselbach either?\"\\n\\n\"No. She seemed so happy at meeting a friend of her husband\\'s. But you\\nwill speak to her about it, will you not? You will protect her. . . . I\\ndon\\'t know what he is preparing against her, against myself. . . . Now\\nthat M. Lenormand is no longer there, he has nothing to fear, he does as\\nhe pleases. Who can unmask him?\"\\n\\n\"I can. I will be responsible for everything. But not a word to\\nanybody.\"\\n\\nThey had reached the porter\\'s lodge. The gate was opened. The prince\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"Good-bye, Geneviève, and be quite easy in your mind. I am there.\"\\n\\nHe shut the gate, turned round and gave a slight start. Opposite him\\nstood the man with the eye-glass, Baron Altenheim, with his head held\\nwell up, his broad shoulders, his powerful frame.\\n\\nThey looked at each other for two or three seconds, in silence. The\\nbaron smiled.\\n\\nThen the baron said:\\n\\n\"I was waiting for you, Lupin.\"\\n\\nFor all his self-mastery, Sernine felt a thrill pass over him. He had\\ncome to unmask his adversary; and his adversary had unmasked him at the\\nfirst onset. And, at the same time, the adversary was accepting the\\ncontest boldly, brazenly, as though he felt sure of victory. It was a\\nswaggering thing to do and gave evidence of no small amount of pluck.\\n\\nThe two men, violently hostile one to the other, took each other\\'s\\nmeasure with their eyes.\\n\\n\"And what then?\" asked Sernine.\\n\\n\"What then? Don\\'t you think we have occasion for a meeting?\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"I want to talk to you.\"\\n\\n\"What day will suit you?\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow. Let us lunch together at a restaurant.\"\\n\\n\"Why not at your place?\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know my address.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do.\"\\n\\nWith a swift movement, the prince pulled out a newspaper protruding from\\nAltenheim\\'s pocket, a paper still in its addressed wrapper, and said:\\n\\n\"No. 29, Villa Dupont.\"\\n\\n\"Well played!\" said the other. \"Then we\\'ll say, to-morrow, at my place.\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow, at your place. At what time?\"\\n\\n\"One o\\'clock.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be there. Good-bye.\"\\n\\nThey were about to walk away. Altenheim stopped:\\n\\n\"Oh, one word more, prince. Bring a weapon with you.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"I keep four men-servants and you will be alone.\"\\n\\n\"I have my fists,\" said Sernine. \"We shall be on even terms.\"\\n\\nHe turned his back on him and then, calling him back:\\n\\n\"Oh, one word more, baron. Engage four more servants.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"I have thought it over. I shall bring my whip.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAt one o\\'clock the next day, precisely, a horseman rode through the gate\\nof the so-called Villa Dupont, a peaceful, countrified private road,\\nthe only entrance to which is in the Rue Pergolèse, close to the Avenue\\ndu Bois.\\n\\nIt is lined with gardens and handsome private houses; and, right at the\\nend, it is closed by a sort of little park containing a large old house,\\nbehind which runs the Paris circular railway. It was here, at No. 29,\\nthat Baron Altenheim lived.\\n\\nSernine flung the reins of his horse to a groom whom he had sent on\\nahead and said:\\n\\n\"Bring him back at half-past two.\"\\n\\nHe rang the bell. The garden-gate opened and he walked to the front-door\\nsteps, where he was awaited by two tall men in livery who ushered him\\ninto an immense, cold, stone hall, devoid of any ornament. The door\\nclosed behind him with a heavy thud; and, great and indomitable as his\\ncourage was, he nevertheless underwent an unpleasant sensation at\\nfeeling himself alone, surrounded by enemies, in that isolated prison.\\n\\n\"Say Prince Sernine.\"\\n\\nThe drawing-room was near and he was shown straight in.\\n\\n\"Ah, there you are, my dear prince!\" said the baron, coming toward him.\\n\"Well, will you believe--Dominique, lunch in twenty minutes. Until then,\\ndon\\'t let us be interrupted--will you believe, my dear prince, that I\\nhardly expected to see you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, really? Why?\"\\n\\n\"Well, your declaration of war, this morning, is so plain that an\\ninterview becomes superfluous.\"\\n\\n\"My declaration of war?\"\\n\\nThe baron unfolded a copy of the _Grand Journal_ and pointed to a\\nparagraph which ran as follows:\\n\\n      \"We are authoritatively informed that M. Lenormand\\'s\\n      disappearance has roused Arsène Lupin into taking\\n      action. After a brief enquiry and following on his\\n      proposal to clear up the Kesselbach case, Arsène Lupin\\n      has decided that he will find M. Lenormand, alive or\\n      dead, and that he will deliver the author or authors\\n      of that heinous series of crimes to justice.\"\\n\\n\"This authoritative pronouncement comes from you, my dear prince, of\\ncourse?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it comes from me.\"\\n\\n\"Therefore, I was right: it means war.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nAltenheim gave Sernine a chair, sat down himself and said, in a\\nconciliatory tone:\\n\\n\"Well, no, I cannot allow that. It is impossible that two men like\\nourselves should fight and injure each other. We have only to come to an\\nexplanation, to seek the means: you and I were made to understand each\\nother.\"\\n\\n\"I think, on the contrary, that two men like ourselves are not made to\\nunderstand each other.\"\\n\\nThe baron suppressed a movement of impatience and continued:\\n\\n\"Listen to me, Lupin. . . . By the way, do you mind my calling you\\nLupin?\"\\n\\n\"What shall I call you? Altenheim, Ribeira, or Parbury?\"\\n\\n\"Oho! I see that you are even better posted than I thought! . . . Hang\\nit all, but you\\'re jolly smart! . . . All the more reason why we should\\nagree.\" And, bending toward him, \"Listen, Lupin, and ponder my words\\nwell; I have weighed them carefully, every one. Look here. . . . We two\\nare evenly matched. . . . Does that make you smile? You are wrong: it\\nmay be that you possess resources which I do not; but I have others of\\nwhich you know nothing. Moreover, as you are aware, I have few scruples,\\nsome skill and a capacity for changing my personality which an expert\\nlike yourself ought to appreciate. In short, the two adversaries are\\neach as good as the other. But one question remains unanswered: why are\\nwe adversaries? We are pursuing the same object, you will say? And what\\nthen? Do you know what will come of our rivalry? Each of us will\\nparalyze the efforts and destroy the work of the other; and we shall\\nboth miss our aim! And for whose benefit? Some Lenormand or other, a\\nthird rogue! . . . It\\'s really too silly.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s really too silly, as you say,\" Sernine admitted. \"But there is a\\nremedy.\"\\n\\n\"What is that?\"\\n\\n\"For you to withdraw.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t chaff. I am serious. The proposal which I am going to make is not\\none to be rejected without examination. Here it is, in two words: let\\'s\\nbe partners!\"\\n\\n\"I say!\"\\n\\n\"Of course, each of us will continue free where his own affairs are\\nconcerned. But, for the business in question, let us combine our\\nefforts. Does that suit you? Hand in hand and share alike.\"\\n\\n\"What do you bring?\"\\n\\n\"I?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you know what I\\'m worth; I\\'ve delivered my proofs. In the alliance\\nwhich you are proposing, you know the figure, so to speak of my\\nmarriage-portion. What\\'s yours?\"\\n\\n\"Steinweg.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not much.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s immense. Through Steinweg, we learn the truth about Pierre Leduc.\\nThrough Steinweg, we get to know what the famous Kesselbach plan is all\\nabout.\"\\n\\nSernine burst out laughing:\\n\\n\"And you need me for that?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand.\"\\n\\n\"Come, old chap, your offer is childish. You have Steinweg in your\\nhands. If you wish for my collaboration, it is because you have not\\nsucceeded in making him speak. But for that fact, you would do without\\nmy services.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what of it?\"\\n\\n\"I refuse.\"\\n\\nThe two men stood up to each other once more, violent and implacable.\\n\\n\"I refuse,\" said Sernine. \"Lupin requires nobody, in order to act. I am\\none of those who walk alone. If you were my equal, as you pretend, the\\nidea of a partnership would never have entered your head. The man who\\nhas the stature of a leader commands. Union implies obedience. I do not\\nobey.\"\\n\\n\"You refuse? You refuse?\" repeated Altenheim, turning pale under the\\ninsult.\\n\\n\"All that I can do for you, old chap, is to offer you a place in my\\nband. You\\'ll be a private soldier, to begin with. Under my orders, you\\nshall see how a general wins a battle . . . and how he pockets the\\nbooty, by himself and for himself. Does that suit you . . . Tommy?\"\\n\\nAltenheim was beside himself with fury. He gnashed his teeth:\\n\\n\"You are making a mistake, Lupin,\" he mumbled, \"you are making a\\nmistake. . . . I don\\'t want anybody either; and this business gives me\\nno more difficulty than plenty of others which I have pulled off. . . .\\nWhat I said was said in order to effect our object more quickly and\\nwithout inconveniencing each other.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re not inconveniencing me,\" said Lupin, scornfully.\\n\\n\"Look here! If we don\\'t combine, only one of us will succeed.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s good enough for me.\"\\n\\n\"And he will only succeed by passing over the other\\'s body. Are you\\nprepared for that sort of duel, Lupin? A duel to the death, do you\\nunderstand? . . . The knife is a method which you despise; but suppose\\nyou received one, Lupin, right in the throat?\"\\n\\n\"Aha! So, when all is said, that\\'s what you propose?\"\\n\\n\"No, I am not very fond of shedding blood. . . . Look at my fists: I\\nstrike . . . and my man falls. . . . I have special blows of my own.\\n. . . But _the other one_ kills . . . remember . . . the little wound in\\nthe throat. . . . Ah, Lupin, beware of him, beware of that one! . . . He\\nis terrible, he is implacable. . . . Nothing stops him.\"\\n\\nHe spoke these words in a low voice and with such excitement that\\nSernine shuddered at the hideous thought of the unknown murderer:\\n\\n\"Baron,\" he sneered, \"one would think you were afraid of your\\naccomplice!\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid for the others, for those who bar our road, for you,\\nLupin. Accept, or you are lost. I shall act myself, if necessary. The\\ngoal is too near . . . I have my hand on it. . . . Get out of my way,\\nLupin!\"\\n\\nHe was all energy and exasperated will. He spoke forcibly and so\\nbrutally that he seemed ready to strike his enemy then and there.\\n\\nSernine shrugged his shoulders:\\n\\n\"Lord, how hungry I am!\" he said, yawning. \"What a time to lunch at!\"\\n\\nThe door opened.\\n\\n\"Lunch is served, sir,\" said the butler.\\n\\n\"Ah, that\\'s good hearing!\"\\n\\nIn the doorway, Altenheim caught Sernine by the arm and, disregarding\\nthe servant\\'s presence:\\n\\n\"If you take my advice . . . accept. This is a serious moment in your\\nlife . . . and you will do better, I swear to you, you will do better\\n. . . to accept. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Caviare!\" cried Sernine. \"Now, that\\'s too sweet of you. . . . You\\nremembered that you were entertaining a Russian prince!\"\\n\\nThey sat down facing each other, with the baron\\'s greyhound, a large\\nanimal with long, silver hair, between them.\\n\\n\"Let me introduce Sirius, my most faithful friend.\"\\n\\n\"A fellow-countryman,\" said Sernine. \"I shall never forget the one which\\nthe Tsar was good enough to give me when I had the honor to save his\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you had that honor . . . a terrorist conspiracy, no doubt?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a conspiracy got up by myself. You must know, this dog--its name,\\nby the way, was Sebastopol. . . .\"\\n\\nThe lunch continued merrily. Altenheim had recovered his good humor and\\nthe two men vied with each other in wit and politeness. Sernine told\\nanecdotes which the baron capped with others; and it was a succession of\\nstories of hunting, sport and travel, in which the oldest names in\\nEurope were constantly cropping up: Spanish grandees, English lords,\\nHungarian magyars, Austrian archdukes.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said Sernine, \"what a fine profession is ours! It brings us into\\ntouch with all the best people. Here, Sirius, a bit of this truffled\\nchicken!\"\\n\\nThe dog did not take his eyes off him, and snapped at everything that\\nSernine gave it.\\n\\n\"A glass of Chambertin, prince?\"\\n\\n\"With pleasure, baron.\"\\n\\n\"I can recommend it. It comes from King Leopold\\'s cellar.\"\\n\\n\"A present?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a present I made myself.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s delicious. . . . What a bouquet! . . . With this _pâté de foie\\ngras_, it\\'s simply wonderful! . . . I must congratulate you, baron; you\\nhave a first-rate chef.\"\\n\\n\"My chef is a woman-cook, prince. I bribed her with untold gold to leave\\nLevraud, the socialist deputy. I say, try this hot chocolate-ice; and\\nlet me call your special attention to the little dry cakes that go with\\nit. They\\'re an invention of genius, those cakes.\"\\n\\n\"The shape is charming, in any case,\" said Sernine, helping himself. \"If\\nthey taste as good as they look. . . . Here, Sirius, you\\'re sure to like\\nthis. Locusta herself could not have done better.\"\\n\\nHe took one of the cakes and gave it to the dog. Sirius swallowed it at\\na gulp, stood motionless for two or three seconds, as though dazed,\\nthen turned in a circle and fell to the floor dead.\\n\\nSernine started back from his chair, lest one of the footmen should fall\\nupon him unawares. Then he burst out laughing:\\n\\n\"Look here, baron, next time you want to poison one of your friends, try\\nto steady your voice and to keep your hands from shaking. . . .\\nOtherwise, people suspect you. . . . But I thought you disliked murder?\"\\n\\n\"With the knife, yes,\" said Altenheim, quite unperturbed. \"But I have\\nalways had a wish to poison some one. I wanted to see what it was like.\"\\n\\n\"By Jove, old chap, you choose your subjects well! A Russian prince!\"\\n\\nHe walked up to Altenheim and, in a confidential tone, said:\\n\\n\"Do you know what would have happened if you had succeeded, that is to\\nsay, if my friends had not seen me return at three o\\'clock at the\\nlatest? Well, at half-past three the prefect of police would have known\\nexactly all that there was to know about the so-called Baron Altenheim;\\nand the said baron would have been copped before the day was out and\\nclapped into jail.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh!\" said Altenheim. \"Prison one escapes from . . . whereas one does\\nnot come back from the kingdom where I was sending you.\"\\n\\n\"True, but you would have to send me there first; and that\\'s not so\\neasy.\"\\n\\n\"I only wanted a mouthful of one of those cakes.\"\\n\\n\"Are you quite sure?\"\\n\\n\"Try.\"\\n\\n\"One thing\\'s certain, my lad: you haven\\'t the stuff yet which great\\nadventurers are made of; and I doubt if you\\'ll ever have it,\\nconsidering the sort of traps you lay for me. A man who thinks himself\\nworthy of leading the life which you and I have the honor to lead must\\nalso be fit to lead it, and, for that, must be prepared for every\\neventuality: he must even be prepared not to die if some ragamuffin or\\nother tries to poison him. . . . An undaunted soul in an unassailable\\nbody: that is the ideal which he must set before himself . . . and\\nattain. Try away, old chap. As for me, I am undaunted and unassailable.\\nRemember King Mithridates!\"\\n\\nHe went back to his chair:\\n\\n\"Let\\'s finish our lunch. But as I like proving the virtues to which I\\nlay claim, and as, on the other hand, I don\\'t want to hurt your cook\\'s\\nfeelings, just pass me that plate of cakes.\"\\n\\nHe took one of them, broke it in two and held out one half to the baron:\\n\\n\"Eat that!\"\\n\\nThe other gave a movement of recoil.\\n\\n\"Funk!\" said Sernine.\\n\\nAnd, before the wondering eyes of the baron and his satellites, he began\\nto eat the first and then the second half of the cake, quietly,\\nconscientiously, as a man eats a dainty of which he would hate to miss\\nthe smallest morsel.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThey met again.\\n\\nThat same evening, Prince Sernine invited Baron Altenheim to dinner at\\nthe Cabaret Vatel, with a party consisting of a poet, a musician, a\\nfinancier and two pretty actresses, members of the Théâtre Français.\\n\\nThe next day, they lunched together in the Bois and, at night, they met\\nat the Opéra.\\n\\nThey saw each other every day for a week. One would have thought that\\nthey could not do without each other and that they were united by a\\ngreat friendship, built up of mutual confidence, sympathy and esteem.\\n\\nThey had a capital time, drinking good wine, smoking excellent cigars,\\nand laughing like two madmen.\\n\\nIn reality, they were watching each other fiercely. Mortal enemies,\\nseparated by a merciless hatred, each feeling sure of winning and\\nlonging for victory with an unbridled will, they waited for the\\npropitious moment: Altenheim to do away with Sernine; and Sernine to\\nhurl Altenheim into the pit which he was digging for him.\\n\\nEach knew that the catastrophe could not be long delayed. One or other\\nof them must meet with his doom; and it was a question of hours, or, at\\nmost, of days.\\n\\nIt was an exciting tragedy, and one of which a man like Sernine was\\nbound to relish the strange and powerful zest. To know your adversary\\nand to live by his side; to feel that death is waiting for you at the\\nleast false step, at the least act of thoughtlessness: what a joy, what\\na delight!\\n\\nOne evening, they were alone together in the garden of the Rue Cambon\\nClub, to which Altenheim also belonged. It was the hour before dusk, in\\nthe month of June, at which men begin to dine before the members come in\\nfor the evening\\'s card-play. They were strolling round a little lawn,\\nalong which ran a wall lined with shrubs. Beyond the shrubs was a small\\ndoor. Suddenly, while Altenheim was speaking, Sernine received the\\nimpression that his voice became less steady, that it was almost\\ntrembling. He watched him out of the corner of his eye. Altenheim had\\nhis hand in the pocket of his jacket; and Sernine _saw_ that hand,\\nthrough the cloth, clutch the handle of a dagger, hesitating, wavering,\\nresolute and weak by turns.\\n\\nO exquisite moment! Was he going to strike? Which would gain the day:\\nthe timid instinct that dare not, or the conscious will, intense upon\\nthe act of killing?\\n\\nHis chest flung out, his arms behind his back, Sernine waited, with\\nalternate thrills of pleasure and of pain. The baron had ceased talking;\\nand they now walked on in silence, side by side.\\n\\n\"Well, why don\\'t you strike?\" cried the prince, impatiently. He had\\nstopped and, turning to his companion: \"Strike!\" he said. \"This is the\\ntime or never. There is no one to see you. You can slip out through that\\nlittle door; the key happens to be hanging on the wall; and good-bye,\\nbaron . . . unseen and unknown! . . . But, of course, all this was\\narranged . . . you brought me here. . . . And you\\'re hesitating! Why on\\nearth don\\'t you strike?\"\\n\\nHe looked him straight in the eyes. The other was livid, quivering with\\nimpotent strength.\\n\\n\"You milksop!\" Sernine sneered. \"I shall never make anything of you.\\nShall I tell you the truth? Well, you\\'re afraid of me. Yes, old chap,\\nyou never feel quite sure what may happen to you when you\\'re face to\\nface with me. You want to act, whereas it\\'s my acts, my possible acts\\nthat govern the situation. No, it\\'s quite clear that you\\'re not the man\\nyet to put out my star!\"\\n\\nHe had not finished speaking when he felt himself seized round the\\nthroat and dragged backward. Some one hiding in the shrubbery, near the\\nlittle door, had caught him by the head. He saw a hand raised, armed\\nwith a knife with a gleaming blade. The hand fell; the point of the\\nknife caught him right in the throat.\\n\\nAt the same moment Altenheim sprang upon him to finish him off; and they\\nrolled over into the flower-borders. It was a matter of twenty or thirty\\nseconds at most. Powerful and experienced wrestler as he was, Altenheim\\nyielded almost immediately, uttering a cry of pain. Sernine rose and ran\\nto the little door, which had just closed upon a dark form. It was too\\nlate. He heard the key turn in the lock. He was unable to open it.\\n\\n\"Ah, you scoundrel!\" he said. \"The day on which I catch you will be the\\nday on which I shed my first blood! That I swear to God! . . .\"\\n\\nHe went back, stooped and picked up the pieces of the knife, which had\\nbroken as it struck him.\\n\\nAltenheim was beginning to move. Sernine asked:\\n\\n\"Well, baron, feeling better? You didn\\'t know that blow, eh? It\\'s what I\\ncall the direct blow in the solar plexus; that is to say, it snuffs out\\nyour vital sun like a candle. It\\'s clean, quick, painless . . . and\\ninfallible. Whereas a blow with a dagger . . . ? Pooh! A man has only to\\nwear a little steel-wove gorget, as I do, and he can set the whole world\\nat defiance, especially your little pal in black, seeing that he always\\nstrikes at the throat, the silly monster! . . . Here, look at his\\nfavorite plaything . . . smashed to atoms!\"\\n\\nHe offered him his hand:\\n\\n\"Come, get up, baron. You shall dine with me. And do please remember\\nthe secret of my superiority: an undaunted soul in an unassailable\\nbody.\"\\n\\nHe went back to the club rooms, reserved a table for two, sat down on a\\nsofa, and while waiting for dinner, soliloquized, under his breath:\\n\\n\"It\\'s certainly an amusing game, but it\\'s becoming dangerous. I must get\\nit over . . . otherwise those beggars will send me to Paradise earlier\\nthan I want to go. The nuisance is that I can\\'t do anything before I\\nfind old Steinweg, for, when all is said, old Steinweg is the only\\ninteresting factor in the whole business; and my one reason for sticking\\nto the baron is that I keep on hoping to pick up some clue or other.\\nWhat the devil have they done with him? Altenheim is in daily\\ncommunication with him: that is beyond a doubt; it is equally beyond a\\ndoubt that he is doing his utmost to drag out of him what he knows about\\nthe Kesselbach scheme. But where does he see him? Where has he got him\\nshut up? With friends? In his own house, at 29, Villa Dupont?\"\\n\\nHe reflected for some time, then lit a cigarette, took three puffs at it\\nand threw it away. This was evidently a signal, for two young men came\\nand sat down beside him. He did not seem to know them, but he conversed\\nwith them by stealth. It was the brothers Doudeville, got up that day\\nlike men of fashion.\\n\\n\"What is it, governor?\"\\n\\n\"Take six of our men, go to 29, Villa Dupont and make your way in.\"\\n\\n\"The devil! How?\"\\n\\n\"In the name of the law. Are you not detective-inspectors? A search.\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"But we haven\\'t the right. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Take it.\"\\n\\n\"And the servants? If they resist?\"\\n\\n\"There are only four of them.\"\\n\\n\"If they call out?\"\\n\\n\"They won\\'t call out.\"\\n\\n\"If Altenheim returns?\"\\n\\n\"He won\\'t return before ten o\\'clock. I\\'ll see to it. That gives you two\\nhours and a half, which is more than you require to explore the house\\nfrom top to bottom. If you find old Steinweg, come and tell me.\"\\n\\nBaron Altenheim came up. Sernine went to meet him:\\n\\n\"Let\\'s have some dinner, shall we? That little incident in the garden\\nhas made me feel hungry. By the way, my dear baron, I have a few bits of\\nadvice to give you. . . .\"\\n\\nThey sat down to table.\\n\\nAfter dinner, Sernine suggested a game of billiards. Altenheim accepted.\\nWhen the game was over, they went to the baccarat-room. The croupier was\\njust shouting:\\n\\n\"There are fifty louis in the bank. Any bids?\"\\n\\n\"A hundred louis,\" said Altenheim.\\n\\nSernine looked at his watch. Ten o\\'clock. The Doudevilles had not\\nreturned. The search, therefore, had been fruitless.\\n\\n\"Banco,\" he said.\\n\\nAltenheim sat down and dealt the cards:\\n\\n\"I give.\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Seven.\"\\n\\n\"Six. I lose,\" said Sernine. \"Shall I double the stakes?\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said the baron.\\n\\nHe dealt out the cards.\\n\\n\"Eight,\" said Sernine.\\n\\n\"Nine,\" said the baron, laying his cards down.\\n\\nSernine turned on his heels, muttering:\\n\\n\"That costs me three hundred louis, but I don\\'t mind; it fixes him\\nhere.\"\\n\\nTen minutes later his motor set him down in front of 29, Villa Dupont;\\nand he found the Doudevilles and their men collected in the hall:\\n\\n\"Have you hunted out the old boy?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Dash it! But he must be somewhere or other. Where are the four\\nservants?\"\\n\\n\"Over there, in the pantry, tied up, with the cook as well.\"\\n\\n\"Good. I would as soon they did not see me. Go all you others. Jean,\\nstay outside and keep watch: Jacques, show me over the house.\"\\n\\nHe quickly ran through the cellar, the ground floor, the first and\\nsecond floors and the attic. He practically stopped nowhere, knowing\\nthat he would not discover in a few minutes what his men had not been\\nable to discover in three hours. But he carefully noted the shape and\\nthe arrangement of the rooms, and looked for some little detail which\\nwould put him on the scent.\\n\\nWhen he had finished, he returned to a bedroom which Doudeville had told\\nhim was Altenheim\\'s, and examined it attentively:\\n\\n\"This will do,\" he said, raising a curtain that concealed a dark closet,\\nfull of clothes. \"From here I can see the whole of the room.\"\\n\\n\"But if the baron searches the house?\"\\n\\n\"Why should he?\"\\n\\n\"He will know that we have been here, through his servants.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but he will never dream that one of us is putting up here for the\\nnight. He will think that the attempt failed, that is all, so I shall\\nstay.\"\\n\\n\"And how will you get out?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s asking me more than I can tell you! The great thing was to\\nget in. Here I am, and here I stay. Go, Doudeville, and shut the doors\\nas you go.\"\\n\\nHe sat down on a little box at the back of the cupboard. Four rows of\\nhanging clothes protected him. Except in the case of a close\\ninvestigation, he was evidently quite safe.\\n\\nTwo hours passed. He heard the dull sound of a horse\\'s hoofs and the\\ntinkling of a collar-bell. A carriage stopped, the front door slammed\\nand almost immediately he heard voices, exclamations, a regular outcry\\nthat increased, probably, as each of the prisoners was released from his\\ngag.\\n\\n\"They are explaining the thing to him,\" he thought. \"The baron must be\\nin a tearing rage. He now understands the reason for my conduct at the\\nclub to-night and sees that I have dished him nicely. . . . Dished? That\\ndepends. . . . After all, I haven\\'t got Steinweg yet. . . . That is the\\nfirst thing that he will want to know: did they get Steinweg? To find\\nthis out, he will go straight to the hiding-place. If he goes up, it\\nmeans that the hiding-place is upstairs. If he goes down, then it is in\\nthe basement.\"\\n\\nHe listened. The sound of voices continued in the rooms on the ground\\nfloor, but it did not seem as if any one were moving. Altenheim must be\\ncross-examining his confederates. It was half an hour before Sernine\\nheard steps mounting the staircase.\\n\\n\"Then it must be upstairs,\" he said to himself. \"But why did they wait\\nso long?\"\\n\\n\"Go to bed, all of you,\" said Altenheim\\'s voice.\\n\\nThe baron entered his room with one of his men and shut the door:\\n\\n\"And I am going to bed, too, Dominique. We should be no further if we\\nsat arguing all night.\"\\n\\n\"My opinion is,\" said the other, \"that he came to fetch Steinweg.\"\\n\\n\"That is my opinion, too; and that\\'s why I\\'m really enjoying myself,\\nseeing that Steinweg isn\\'t here.\"\\n\\n\"But where is he, after all? What have you done with him?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s my secret; and you know I keep my secrets to myself. All that I\\ncan tell you is that he is in safe keeping, and that he won\\'t get out\\nbefore he has spoken.\"\\n\\n\"So the prince is sold?\"\\n\\n\"Sold is the word. And he has had to fork out to attain this fine\\nresult! Oh, I\\'ve had a good time to-night! . . . Poor prince!\"\\n\\n\"For all that,\" said the other, \"we shall have to get rid of him.\"\\n\\n\"Make your mind easy, old man; that won\\'t take long. Before a week\\'s out\\nyou shall have a present of a pocket-book made out of Lupin-skin. But\\nlet me go to bed now. I\\'m dropping with sleep.\"\\n\\nThere was a sound of the door closing. Then Sernine heard the baron push\\nthe bolt, empty his pockets, wind up his watch and undress. He seemed in\\na gay mood, whistling and singing, and even talking aloud:\\n\\n\"Yes, a Lupin-skin pocket-book . . . in less than a week . . . in less\\nthan four days! . . . Otherwise he\\'ll eat us up, the bully! . . . No\\nmatter, he missed his shot to-night. . . . His calculation was right\\nenough, though . . . Steinweg was bound to be here. . . . Only, there\\nyou are! . . .\"\\n\\nHe got into bed and at once switched off the light.\\n\\nSernine had come forward as far as the dividing curtain, which he now\\nlifted slightly, and he saw the vague light of the night filtering\\nthrough the windows, leaving the bed in profound darkness.\\n\\nHe hesitated. Should he leap out upon the baron, take him by the throat\\nand obtain from him by force and threats what he had not been able to\\nobtain by craft? Absurd? Altenheim would never allow himself to be\\nintimidated.\\n\\n\"I say, he\\'s snoring now,\" muttered Sernine. \"Well, I\\'m off. At the\\nworst, I shall have wasted a night.\"\\n\\nHe did not go. He felt that it would be impossible for him to go, that\\nhe must wait, that chance might yet serve his turn.\\n\\nWith infinite precautions, he took four or five coats and great-coats\\nfrom their hooks, laid them on the floor, made himself comfortable and,\\nwith his back to the wall, went peacefully to sleep.\\n\\nThe baron was not an early riser. A clock outside was striking nine when\\nhe got out of bed and rang for his servant.\\n\\nHe read the letters which his man brought him, splashed about in his\\ntub, dressed without saying a word and sat down to his table to write,\\nwhile Dominique was carefully hanging up the clothes of the previous day\\nin the cupboard and Sernine asking himself, with his fists ready to\\nstrike:\\n\\n\"I wonder if I shall have to stave in this fellow\\'s solar plexus?\"\\n\\nAt ten o\\'clock the baron was ready:\\n\\n\"Leave me,\" said he to the servant.\\n\\n\"There\\'s just this waistcoat. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Leave me, I say. Come back when I ring . . . not before.\"\\n\\nHe shut the door himself, like a man who does not trust others, went to\\na table on which a telephone was standing and took down the receiver:\\n\\n\"Hullo! . . . Put me on to Garches, please, mademoiselle. . . . Very\\nwell, I\\'ll wait till you ring me up. . . .\"\\n\\nHe sat down to the instrument.\\n\\nThe telephone-bell rang.\\n\\n\"Hullo!\" said Altenheim. \"Is that Garches? . . . Yes, that\\'s right.\\n. . . Give me number 38, please, mademoiselle. . . .\"\\n\\nA few seconds later, in a lower voice, as low and as distinct as he\\ncould make it, he began:\\n\\n\"Are you 38? . . . It\\'s I speaking; no useless words. . . . Yesterday?\\n. . . Yes, you missed him in the garden. . . . Another time, of course;\\nbut the thing\\'s becoming urgent. . . . He had the house searched last\\nnight. . . . I\\'ll tell you about it. . . . Found nothing, of course.\\n. . . What? . . . Hullo! . . . No, old Steinweg refuses to speak. . . .\\nThreats, promises, nothing\\'s any good. . . . Hullo! . . . Yes, of\\ncourse, he sees that we can do nothing. . . . We know just a part of the\\nKesselbach scheme and of the story of Pierre Leduc. . . . He\\'s the only\\none who has the answer to the riddle. . . . Oh, he\\'ll speak all right;\\nthat I\\'ll answer for . . . this very night, too . . . If not . . . What?\\n. . . Well, what can we do? Anything rather than let him escape! Do you\\nwant the prince to bag him from us? As for the prince, we shall have to\\ncook his goose in three days from now. . . . You have an idea? . . .\\nYes, that\\'s a good idea. . . . Oh, oh, excellent! I\\'ll see to it. . . .\\nWhen shall we meet? Will Tuesday do? Right you are. I\\'ll come on Tuesday\\n. . . at two o\\'clock. . . . Good-bye.\"\\n\\nHe replaced the receiver and went out.\\n\\nA few hours later, while the servants were at lunch, Prince Sernine\\nstrolled quietly out of the Villa Dupont, feeling rather faint in the\\nhead and weak in the knees, and, while making for the nearest\\nrestaurant, he thus summed up the situation:\\n\\n\"So, on Tuesday next, Altenheim and the Palace Hotel murderer have an\\nappointment at Garches, in a house with the telephone number 38. On\\nTuesday, therefore, I shall hand over the two criminals to the police\\nand set M. Lenormand at liberty. In the evening, it will be old\\nSteinweg\\'s turn; and I shall learn, at last, whether Pierre Leduc is the\\nson of a pork-butcher or not and whether he will make a suitable husband\\nfor Geneviève. So be it!\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock on Tuesday morning Valenglay, the prime minister, sent\\nfor the prefect of police and M. Weber, the deputy-chief of the\\ndetective-service, and showed them an express letter which he had just\\nreceived:\\n\\n      \"MONSIEUR LE PRÉSIDENT DU CONSEIL,\\n\\n      \"Knowing the interest which you take in M. Lenormand,\\n      I am writing to inform you of certain facts which\\n      chance has revealed to me.\\n\\n      \"M. Lenormand is locked up in the cellars of the Villa\\n      des Glycines at Garches, near the House of Retreat.\\n\\n      \"The ruffians of the Palace Hotel have resolved to\\n      murder him at two o\\'clock to-day.\\n\\n      \"If the police require my assistance, they will find\\n      me at half-past one in the garden of the House of\\n      Retreat, or at the garden-house occupied by Mrs.\\n      Kesselbach, whose friend I have the honor to be.\\n\\n        \"I am, Monsieur le Président du Conseil,\\n                      \"Your obedient servant,\\n                                 \"PRINCE SERNINE.\"\\n\\n\"This is an exceedingly grave matter, my dear M.

He is a serious,\\nintelligent man. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Will you allow me, Monsieur le Président,\" asked the deputy-chief\\ndetective, \"to show you another letter which I also received this\\nmorning?\"\\n\\n\"About the same case?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Let me see it.\"\\n\\nHe took the letter and read:\\n\\n      \"SIR,\\n\\n      \"This is to inform you that Prince Paul Sernine, who\\n      calls himself Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s friend, is really\\n      Arsène Lupin.\\n\\n      \"One proof will be sufficient: _Paul Sernine_ is the\\n      anagram of _Arsène Lupin_.

Weber added, while Valenglay stood amazed:\\n\\n\"This time, our friend Lupin has found an adversary who is a match for\\nhim. While he denounces the other, the other betrays him to us. And the\\nfox is caught in the trap.\"\\n\\n\"What do you propose to do?\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Président, I shall take two hundred men with me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nTHE OLIVE-GREEN FROCK-COAT\\n\\n\\nA quarter past twelve, in a restaurant near the Madeleine. The prince is\\nat lunch. Two young men sit down at the next table. He bows to them and\\nbegins to speak to them, as to friends whom he has met by chance.\\n\\n\"Are you going on the expedition, eh?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"How many men altogether?\"\\n\\n\"Six, I think. Each goes down by himself. We\\'re to meet M. Weber at a\\nquarter to two, near the House of Retreat.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, I shall be there.\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"Am I not leading the expedition? And isn\\'t it my business to find M.\\nLenormand, seeing that I\\'ve announced it publicly?\"\\n\\n\"Then you believe that M. Lenormand is not dead, governor?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure of it.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know anything?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, since yesterday I know for certain that Altenheim and his gang\\ntook M. Lenormand and Gourel to the bridge at Bougival and heaved them\\noverboard. Gourel sank, but M. Lenormand managed to save himself. I\\nshall furnish all the necessary proofs when the time comes.\"\\n\\n\"But, then, if he\\'s alive, why doesn\\'t he show himself?\"\\n\\n\"Because he\\'s not free.\"\\n\\n\"Is what you said true, then? Is he in the cellars of the Villa des\\nGlycines?\"\\n\\n\"I have every reason to think so.\"\\n\\n\"But how do you know? . . . What clue? . . .\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s my secret. I can tell you one thing: the revelation will\\nbe--what shall I say--sensational. Have you finished?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"My car is behind the Madeleine. Join me there.\"\\n\\nAt Garches, Sernine sent the motor away, and they walked to the path\\nthat led to Geneviève\\'s school. There he stopped:\\n\\n\"Listen to me, lads. This is of the highest importance. You will ring at\\nthe House of Retreat. As inspectors, you have your right of entry, have\\nyou not? You will then go to the Pavillon Hortense, the empty one. There\\nyou will run down to the basement and you will find an old shutter,\\nwhich you have only to lift to see the opening of a tunnel which I\\ndiscovered lately and which forms a direct communication with the Villa\\ndes Glycines. It was by means of this that Gertrude and Baron Altenheim\\nused to meet. And it was this way that M. Lenormand passed, only to end\\nby falling into the hands of his enemies.\"\\n\\n\"You think so, governor?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I think so. And now the point is this: you must go and make sure\\nthat the tunnel is exactly in the condition in which I left it last\\nnight; that the two doors which bar it are open; and that there is\\nstill, in a hole near the second door, a parcel wrapped in a piece of\\nblack cloth which I put there myself.\"\\n\\n\"Are we to undo the parcel?\"\\n\\n\"No, that\\'s not necessary. It\\'s a change of clothes. Go; and don\\'t let\\nyourselves be seen more than you can help. I will wait for you.\"\\n\\nTen minutes later, they were back:\\n\\n\"The two doors are open,\" said one of the Doudevilles.\\n\\n\"And the black cloth parcel?\"\\n\\n\"In its place near the second door.\"\\n\\n\"Capital! It is twenty-five past one. Weber will be arriving with his\\nchampions. They are to watch the villa. They will surround it as soon as\\nAltenheim is inside. I have arranged with Weber that I shall ring the\\nbell; the door will be opened; and I shall have my foot inside the\\ncitadel. Once there, I have my plan. Come, I\\'ve an idea that we shall\\nsee some fun.\"\\n\\nAnd Sernine, after dismissing them, walked down the path to the school,\\nsoliloquizing as he went:\\n\\n\"All bodes well. The battle will be fought on the ground chosen by\\nmyself. I am bound to win. I shall get rid of my two adversaries and I\\nshall find myself alone engaged in the Kesselbach case . . . alone, with\\ntwo whacking trump-cards: Pierre Leduc and Steinweg. . . . Besides the\\nking . . . that is to say, Bibi. Only, there\\'s one thing: what is\\nAltenheim up to? Obviously, he has a plan of attack of his own. On which\\nside does he mean to attack me? And how does it come that he has not\\nattacked me yet? It\\'s rather startling. Can he have denounced me to the\\npolice?\"\\n\\nHe went along the little playground of the school. The pupils were at\\ntheir lessons. He knocked at the door.\\n\\n\"Ah, is that you?\" said Mme. Ernemont, opening the door. \"So you have\\nleft Geneviève in Paris?\"\\n\\n\"For me to do that, Geneviève would have to be in Paris,\" he replied.\\n\\n\"So she has been, seeing that you sent for her.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" he exclaimed catching hold of her arm.\\n\\n\"Why, you know better than I!\"\\n\\n\"I know nothing. . . . I know nothing. . . . Speak! . . .\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you write to Geneviève to meet you at the Gare Saint-Lazare?\"\\n\\n\"And did she go?\"\\n\\n\"Why, of course. . . . You were to lunch together at the Hôtel Ritz.\"\\n\\n\"The letter. . . . Show me the letter.\"\\n\\nShe went to fetch it and gave it to him.\\n\\n\"But, wretched woman, couldn\\'t you see that it was a forgery? The\\nhandwriting is a good imitation . . . but it\\'s a forgery. . . . Any one\\ncan see that.\" He pressed his clenched hands to his temples with rage.\\n\"That\\'s the move I was wondering about. Oh, the dirty scoundrel! He\\'s\\nattacking me through her . . . . But how does he know? No, he does not\\nknow. . . . He\\'s tried it on twice now . . . and it\\'s because of\\nGeneviève, because he\\'s taken a fancy to her. . . . Oh, not that! Never!\\nListen, Victoire, are you sure that she doesn\\'t love him? . . . Oh, I\\'m\\nlosing my head! . . . Wait . . . wait! . . . I must think . . . this\\nisn\\'t the moment. . . .\"\\n\\nHe looked at his watch:\\n\\n\"Twenty-five minutes to two. . . . I have time. . . . Idiot that I am!\\nTime to do what? How do I know where she is?\"\\n\\nHe walked up and down like a madman; and his old nurse seemed astounded\\nat seeing him so excited, with so little control of himself:\\n\\n\"After all,\" she said, \"there is nothing to prove that she did not\\nsuspect the trap at the last moment. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Where could she be?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know . . . perhaps at Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true . . . that\\'s true. . . . You\\'re right,\" he cried, filled\\nwith sudden hope.\\n\\nAnd he set out at a run for the House of Retreat.\\n\\nOn the way, near the gate, he met the brothers Doudeville, who were\\nentering the porter\\'s lodge. The lodge looked out on the road; and this\\nenabled them to watch the approaches to the Villa des Glycines. Without\\nstopping, he went straight to the Pavillon de l\\'Impératrice, called\\nSuzanne and told her to take him to Mrs. Kesselbach.\\n\\n\"Geneviève?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Geneviève?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; hasn\\'t she been here?\"\\n\\n\"No, not for several days. . . .\"\\n\\n\"But she is to come, is she not?\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I\\'m certain of it. Where do you think she is? Can you remember?\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s no use my trying. I assure you that Geneviève and I had made no\\narrangement to see each other.\" And, suddenly alarmed: \"But you\\'re not\\nanxious, are you? Has anything happened to Geneviève?\"\\n\\n\"No, nothing.\"\\n\\nHe had already left the room. An idea had occurred to him. Suppose\\nAltenheim were not at the Villa des Glycines? Suppose the hour of the\\nmeeting had been changed!\\n\\n\"I must see him,\" he said to himself. \"I must, at all costs.\"\\n\\nAnd he ran along with a disordered air, indifferent to everything. But,\\nin front of the lodge, he at once recovered his composure: he had caught\\nsight of the deputy-chief of the detective-service talking to the\\nbrothers Doudeville in the garden.\\n\\nHad he commanded his usual acute discernment, he would have perceived\\nthe little start which M. Weber gave as he approached; but he saw\\nnothing:\\n\\n\"M. Weber, I believe?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes. . . . To whom have I the honor . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"Prince Sernine.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, very good! Monsieur le Préfet de Police has told me of the great\\nservice which you are doing us, monsieur.\"\\n\\n\"That service will not be complete until I have handed the ruffians over\\nto you.\"\\n\\n\"That won\\'t take long. I believe that one of those ruffians has just\\ngone in; a powerful-looking man, with a swarthy complexion. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s Baron Altenheim. Are your men here, M. Weber?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, concealed along the road, at two hundred yards from this.\"\\n\\n\"Well, M. Weber, it seems to me that you might collect them and bring\\nthem to this lodge. From here we will go to the villa. As Baron\\nAltenheim knows me, I presume they will open the door to me and I will\\ngo in . . . with you.\"\\n\\n\"It is an excellent plan,\" said M. Weber. \"I shall come back at once.\"\\n\\nHe left the garden and walked down the road, in the opposite direction\\nto the Villa des Glycines.\\n\\nSernine quickly took one of the brothers Doudeville by the arm:\\n\\n\"Run after him, Jacques . . . keep him engaged . . . long enough for me\\nto get inside the Glycines. . . . And then delay the attack as long as\\nyou can. . . . Invent pretexts. . . . I shall want ten minutes. . . .\\nLet the villa be surrounded . . . but not entered. And you, Jean, go and\\npost yourself in the Pavillon Hortense, at the entrance to the\\nunderground passage. If the baron tries to go out that way, break his\\nhead.\"\\n\\nThe Doudevilles moved away, as ordered. The prince slipped out and ran\\nto a tall gate, barred with iron, which was the entrance to the\\nGlycines.\\n\\nShould he ring? . . .\\n\\nThere was no one in sight. With one bound, he leapt upon the gate,\\nplacing his foot on the lock; and, hanging on to the bars, getting a\\npurchase with his knees and hoisting himself up with his wrists, he\\nmanaged, at the risk of falling on the sharp points of the bars, to\\nclimb over the gate and jump down.\\n\\nHe found a paved courtyard, which he crossed briskly, and mounted the\\nsteps of a pillared peristyle, on which the windows looked out. These\\nwere all closed to the very top, with full shutters. As he stood\\nthinking how he should make his way into the house, the door was half\\nopened, with a noise of iron that reminded him of the door in the Villa\\nDupont, and Altenheim appeared:\\n\\n\"I say, prince, is that the way you trespass on private property? I\\nshall be forced to call in the gendarmes, my dear fellow!\"\\n\\nSernine caught him by the throat and, throwing him down on a bench:\\n\\n\"Geneviève? . . . Where is Geneviève? If you don\\'t tell me what you\\'ve\\ndone with her, you villain. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Please observe,\" stammered the baron, \"that you are making it\\nimpossible for me to speak.\"\\n\\nSernine released his hold of him:\\n\\n\"To the point! . . . And look sharp! . . . Answer. . . . Geneviève?\"\\n\\n\"There is one thing,\" replied the baron, \"which is much more urgent,\\nespecially where fellows like you and me are concerned, and that is to\\nfeel one\\'s self at home. . . .\"\\n\\nAnd he carefully closed the front door, which he barricaded with bolts.\\nThen, leading Sernine to the adjoining drawing-room, a room without\\nfurniture or curtains, he said:\\n\\n\"Now I\\'m your man. What can I do for you, prince?\"\\n\\n\"Geneviève?\"\\n\\n\"She is in perfect health.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, so you confess . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"Of course! I may even tell you that your imprudence in this respect\\nsurprised me. Why didn\\'t you take a few precautions? It was inevitable.\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"Enough! Where is she?\"\\n\\n\"You are not very polite.\"\\n\\n\"Where is she?\"\\n\\n\"Between four walls, free. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Free?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, free to go from one wall to another.\"\\n\\n\"Where? Where?\"\\n\\n\"Come, prince, do you think I should be fool enough to tell you the\\nsecret by which I hold you? You love the little girl . . .\"\\n\\n\"Hold your tongue!\" shouted Sernine, beside himself. \"I forbid you.\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"What next? Is there anything to be ashamed of? I love her myself and I\\nhave risked . . .\"\\n\\nHe did not complete his sentence, frightened by the terrific anger of\\nSernine, a restrained, dumb anger that distorted the prince\\'s features.\\n\\nThey looked at each other for a long time, each of them seeking for the\\nadversary\\'s weak point. At last, Sernine stepped forward and, speaking\\nvery distinctly, like a man who is threatening rather than proposing a\\ncompact:\\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" he said. \"You remember the offer of partnership which\\nyou made me? The Kesselbach business for the two of us . . . we were to\\nact together . . . we were to share the profits. . . . I refused. . . .\\nTo-day, I accept. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Too late.\"\\n\\n\"Wait! I accept more than that: I give the whole business up. . . . I\\nshall take no further part in it. . . . You shall have it all. . . . If\\nnecessary, I\\'ll help you.\"\\n\\n\"What is the condition?\"\\n\\n\"Tell me where Geneviève is.\"\\n\\nThe baron shrugged his shoulders:\\n\\n\"You\\'re driveling, Lupin. I\\'m sorry for you . . . at your age. . . .\"\\n\\nThere was a fresh silence between the two enemies, a terrible silence.\\nThen the baron sneered:\\n\\n\"All the same, it\\'s a holy joy to see you like that, sniveling and\\nbegging. I say, it seems to me that the private soldier is giving his\\ngeneral a sound beating!\"\\n\\n\"You ass!\" muttered Sernine.\\n\\n\"Prince, I shall send you my seconds this evening . . . if you are still\\nin this world.\"\\n\\n\"You ass!\" repeated Sernine, with infinite contempt.\\n\\n\"You would rather settle the matter here and now? As you please, prince:\\nyour last hour has struck. You can commend your soul to God. You smile!\\nThat\\'s a mistake. I have one immense advantage over you! I kill . . .\\nwhen it\\'s necessary. . . .\"\\n\\n\"You ass!\" said Sernine once more. He took out his watch. \"It is two\\no\\'clock, baron. You have only a few minutes left. At five past two, ten\\npast at the very latest, M. Weber and half-a-dozen sturdy men, without a\\nscruple amongst them, will lay hands on you. . . . Don\\'t you smile,\\neither. The outlet on which you\\'re reckoning is discovered; I know it:\\nit is guarded. So you are thoroughly caught. It means the scaffold, old\\nchap.\"\\n\\nAltenheim turned livid. He stammered:\\n\\n\"You did this? . . . You have had the infamy . . .\"\\n\\n\"The house is surrounded. The assault is at hand. Speak . . . and I will\\nsave you.\"\\n\\n\"How?\"\\n\\n\"The men watching the outlet in the Pavillon Hortense belong to me. I\\nhave only to give you a word for them and you are saved. Speak!\"\\n\\nAltenheim reflected for a few seconds and seemed to hesitate; but,\\nsuddenly, resolutely, declared:\\n\\n\"This is all bluff. You would never have been simple enough to rush into\\nthe lion\\'s mouth.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re forgetting Geneviève. But for her, do you think I should be\\nhere? Speak!\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. Let us wait,\" said Sernine. \"A cigarette?\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.\"\\n\\nA few seconds passed.\\n\\n\"Do you hear?\" asked Sernine.\\n\\n\"Yes . . . yes . . .\" said Altenheim, rising.\\n\\nBlows rang against the gate. Sernine observed:\\n\\n\"Not even the usual summons . . . no preliminaries. . . . Your mind is\\nstill made up?\"\\n\\n\"More so than ever.\"\\n\\n\"You know that, with the tools they carry, they won\\'t take long?\"\\n\\n\"If they were inside this room I should still refuse.\"\\n\\nThe gate yielded. They heard it creak on its hinges.\\n\\n\"To allow one\\'s self to get nabbed,\" said Sernine, \"is admissible. But\\nto hold out one\\'s own hands to the handcuffs is too silly. Come, don\\'t\\nbe obstinate. Speak . . . and bolt!\"\\n\\n\"And you?\"\\n\\n\"I shall remain. What have I to be afraid of?\"\\n\\n\"Look!\"\\n\\nThe baron pointed to a chink between the shutters. Sernine put his eye\\nto it and jumped back with a start:\\n\\n\"Oh, you scoundrel, so you have denounced me, too! It\\'s not ten men that\\nWeber\\'s bringing, but fifty men, a hundred, two hundred. . . .\"\\n\\nThe baron laughed open-heartedly:\\n\\n\"And, if there are so many of them, it\\'s because they\\'re after Lupin;\\nthat\\'s obvious! Half-a-dozen would have been enough for me.\"\\n\\n\"You informed the police?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"What proof did you give?\"\\n\\n\"Your name: _Paul Sernine_, that is to say, _Arsène Lupin_.\"\\n\\n\"And you found that out all by yourself, did you? . . . A thing which\\nnobody else thought of? . . . Nonsense! It was the other one. Admit\\nit!\"\\n\\nHe looked out through the chink. Swarms of policemen were spreading\\nround the villa; and the blows were now sounding on the door. He must,\\nhowever, think of one of two things: either his escape, or else the\\nexecution of the plan which he had contrived. But to go away, even for a\\nmoment, meant leaving Altenheim; and who could guarantee that the baron\\nhad not another outlet at his disposal to escape by? This thought\\nparalyzed Sernine. The baron free! The baron at liberty to go back to\\nGeneviève and torture her and make her subservient to his odious love!\\n\\nThwarted in his designs, obliged to improvise a new plan on the very\\nsecond, while subordinating everything to the danger which Geneviève was\\nrunning, Sernine passed through a moment of cruel indecision. With his\\neyes fixed on the baron\\'s eyes, he would have liked to tear his secret\\nfrom him and to go away; and he no longer even tried to convince him, so\\nuseless did all words seem to him. And, while pursuing his own thoughts,\\nhe asked himself what the baron\\'s thoughts could be, what his weapons,\\nwhat his hope of safety?\\n\\nThe hall-door, though strongly bolted, though sheeted with iron, was\\nbeginning to give way.\\n\\nThe two men stood behind that door, motionless. The sound of voices, the\\nsense of words reached them.\\n\\n\"You seem very sure of yourself,\" said Sernine.\\n\\n\"I should think so!\" cried the other, suddenly tripping him to the floor\\nand running away.\\n\\nSernine sprang up at once, dived through a little door under the\\nstaircase, through which Altenheim had disappeared, and ran down the\\nstone steps to the basement. . . .\\n\\nA passage led to a large, low, almost pitch-dark room, where he found\\nthe baron on his knees, lifting the flap of a trap-door.\\n\\n\"Idiot!\" shouted Sernine, flinging himself upon him. \"You know that you\\nwill find my men at the end of this tunnel and that they have orders to\\nkill you like a dog. . . . Unless . . . unless you have an outlet that\\njoins on to this. . . . Ah, there, of course, I\\'ve guessed it! . . . And\\nyou imagine . . .\"\\n\\nThe fight was a desperate one. Altenheim, a real colossus, endowed with\\nexceptional muscular force, had caught his adversary round the arms and\\nbody and was pressing him against his own chest, numbing his arms and\\ntrying to smother him.\\n\\n\"Of course . . . of course,\" Sernine panted, with difficulty, \"of course\\n. . . that\\'s well thought out. . . . As long as I can\\'t use my arms to\\nbreak some part of you, you will have the advantage . . . Only . . . can\\nyou . . . ?\"\\n\\nHe gave a shudder. The trap-door, which had closed again and on the flap\\nof which they were bearing down with all their weight, the trap-door\\nseemed to move beneath them. He felt the efforts that were being made to\\nraise it; and the baron must have felt them too, for he desperately\\ntried to shift the ground of the contest so that the trap-door might\\nopen.\\n\\n\"It\\'s \\'the other one\\'!\" thought Sernine, with the sort of unreasoning\\nterror which that mysterious being caused him. \"It\\'s the other one.\\n. . . If he gets through, I\\'m done for.\"\\n\\nBy dint of imperceptible movements, Altenheim had succeeded in shifting\\nhis own position; and he tried to drag his adversary after him. But\\nSernine clung with his legs to the baron\\'s legs and, at the same time,\\nvery gradually, tried to release one of his hands.\\n\\nAbove their heads great blows resounded, like the blows of a\\nbattering-ram. . . .\\n\\n\"I have five minutes,\" thought Sernine. \"In one minute this fellow will\\nhave to . . .\" Then, speaking aloud, \"Look out, old chap. Stand tight!\"\\n\\nHe brought his two knees together with incredible force. The baron\\nyelled, with a twisted thigh. Then Sernine, taking advantage of his\\nadversary\\'s pain, made an effort, freed his right arm and seized him by\\nthe throat:\\n\\n\"That\\'s capital! . . . We shall be more comfortable like this. . . . No,\\nit\\'s not worth while getting out your knife. . . . If you do, I\\'ll wring\\nyour neck like a chicken\\'s. You see, I\\'m polite and considerate. . . .\\nI\\'m not pressing too hard . . . just enough to keep you from even\\nwanting to kick about.\"\\n\\nWhile speaking he took from his pocket a very thin cord and, with one\\nhand, with extreme skill, fastened his wrists. For that matter, the\\nbaron, now at his last gasp, offered not the least resistance. With a\\nfew accurate movements, Sernine tied him up firmly:\\n\\n\"How well you\\'re behaving! What a good thing! I should hardly know you.\\nHere, in case you were thinking of escaping, I have a roll of wire that\\nwill finish off my little work. . . . The wrists first. . . . Now the\\nankles. . . . That\\'s it! . . . By Jove, how nice you look!\"\\n\\nThe baron had gradually come to himself again. He spluttered:\\n\\n\"If you give me up, Geneviève will die.\"\\n\\n\"Really? . . . And how? . . . Explain yourself.\"\\n\\n\"She is locked up. No one knows where she is. If I\\'m put away, she will\\ndie of starvation.\"\\n\\nSernine shuddered. He retorted:\\n\\n\"Yes, but you will speak.\"\\n\\n\"Never!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you will speak. Not now; it\\'s too late. But to-night.\" He bent\\ndown over him and, whispering in his ear, said, \"Listen, Altenheim, and\\nunderstand what I say. You\\'ll be caught presently. To-night, you\\'ll\\nsleep at the Dépôt. That is fatal, irrevocable. I myself can do nothing\\nto prevent it now. And, to-morrow, they will take you to the Santé; and\\nlater, you know where. . . . Well, I\\'m giving you one more chance of\\nsafety. To-night, you understand, I shall come to your cell, at the\\nDépôt, and you shall tell me where Geneviève is. Two hours later, if you\\nhave told the truth, you shall be free. If not . . . it means that you\\ndon\\'t attach much value to your head.\"\\n\\nThe other made no reply. Sernine stood up and listened. There was a\\ngreat crash overhead. The entrance-door yielded. Footsteps beat the\\nflags of the hall and the floor of the drawing room. M. Weber and his\\nmen were searching.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, baron. Think it over until this evening. The prison-cell is a\\ngood counsellor.\"\\n\\nHe pushed his prisoner aside, so as to uncover the trap-door, and lifted\\nit. As he expected, there was no longer any one below on the steps of\\nthe staircase.\\n\\nHe went down, taking care to leave the trap-door open behind him, as\\nthough he meant to come back.\\n\\nThere were twenty steps, at the bottom of which began the passage\\nthrough which M. Lenormand and Gourel had come in the opposite\\ndirection. He entered it and gave an exclamation. He thought he felt\\nsomebody\\'s presence there.\\n\\nHe lit his pocket-lantern. The passage was empty.\\n\\nThen he cocked his revolver and said aloud:\\n\\n\"All right. . . . I\\'m going to fire.\"\\n\\nNo reply. Not a sound.\\n\\n\"It\\'s an illusion, no doubt,\" he thought. \"That creature is becoming an\\nobsession. . . . Come, if I want to pull off my stroke and win the game,\\nI must hurry. . . . The hole in which I hid the parcel of clothes is not\\nfar off. I shall take the parcel . . . and the trick is done. . . . And\\nwhat a trick! One of Lupin\\'s best! . . .\"\\n\\nHe came to a door that stood open and at once stopped. To the right was\\nan excavation, the one which M. Lenormand had made to escape from the\\nrising water. He stooped and threw his light into the opening:\\n\\n\"Oh!\" he said, with a start. \"No, it\\'s not possible . . . Doudeville\\nmust have pushed the parcel farther along.\"\\n\\nBut, search and pry into the darkness as he might, the parcel was gone;\\nand he had no doubt but that it was once more the mysterious being who\\nhad taken it.\\n\\n\"What a pity! The thing was so neatly arranged! The adventure would have\\nresumed its natural course, and I should have achieved my aim with\\ngreater certainty. . . . As it is, I must push along as fast as I can.\\n. . . Doudeville is at the Pavillon Hortense. . . . My retreat is\\ninsured. . . . No more nonsense. . . . I must hurry and set things\\nstraight again, if I can. . . . And we\\'ll attend to \\'him\\' afterward.\\n. . . Oh, he\\'d better keep clear of my claws, that one!\"\\n\\nBut an exclamation of stupor escaped his lips; he had come to the other\\ndoor; and this door, the last before the garden-house, was shut. He\\nflung himself upon it. What was the good? What could he do?\\n\\n\"This time,\" he muttered, \"I\\'m badly done!\"\\n\\nAnd, seized with a sort of lassitude, he sat down. He had a sense of his\\nweakness in the face of the mysterious being. Altenheim hardly counted.\\nBut the other, that person of darkness and silence, the other loomed up\\nbefore him, upset all his plans and exhausted him with his cunning and\\ninfernal attacks.\\n\\nHe was beaten.\\n\\nWeber would find him there, like an animal run to earth, at the bottom\\nof his cave.\\n\\n\"Ah, no!\" he cried, springing up with a bound. \"No! If there were only\\nmyself, well and good! . . . But there is Geneviève, Geneviève, who must\\nbe saved to-night. . . . After all, the game is not yet lost. . . . If\\nthe other one vanished just now, it proves that there is a second outlet\\nsomewhere near. . . . Come, come, Weber and his merry men haven\\'t got me\\nyet. . . .\"\\n\\nHe had already begun to explore the tunnel and, lantern in hand, was\\nexamining the bricks of which the horrible walls were formed, when a\\nyell reached his ears, a dreadful yell that made his flesh creep with\\nanguish.\\n\\nIt came from the direction of the trap-door. And he suddenly remembered\\nthat he had left the trap-door open, at the time when he intended to\\nreturn to the Villa des Glycines.\\n\\nHe hurried back and passed through the first door. His lantern went out\\non the road; and he felt something, or rather somebody, brush past his\\nknees, somebody crawl along the wall. And, at that same moment, he had a\\nfeeling that this being was disappearing, vanishing, he knew not which\\nway.\\n\\nJust then his foot knocked against a step.\\n\\n\"This is the outlet,\" he thought, \"the second outlet through which \\'he\\'\\npasses.\"\\n\\nOverhead, the cry sounded again, less loud, followed by moans, by a\\nhoarse gurgling. . . .\\n\\nHe ran up the stairs, came out in the basement room, and rushed to the\\nbaron.\\n\\nAltenheim lay dying, with the blood streaming from his throat! His bonds\\nwere cut, but the wire that fastened his wrists and ankles was intact.\\n_His accomplice, being unable to release him, had cut his throat._\\n\\nSernine gazed upon the sight with horror. An icy perspiration covered\\nhis whole body. He thought of Geneviève, imprisoned, helpless, abandoned\\nto the most awful of deaths, because the baron alone knew where she was\\nhidden.\\n\\nHe distinctly heard the policemen open the little back door in the hall.\\nHe distinctly heard them come down the kitchen stairs.\\n\\nThere was nothing between him and them save one door, that of the\\nbasement room in which he was. He bolted the door at the very moment\\nwhen the aggressors were laying hold of the handle.\\n\\nThe trap-door was open beside him; it meant possible safety, because\\nthere remained the second outlet.\\n\\n\"No,\" he said to himself, \"Geneviève first. Afterward, if I have time, I\\nwill think of myself.\"\\n\\nHe knelt down and put his hand on the baron\\'s breast. The heart was\\nstill beating.\\n\\nHe stooped lower still:\\n\\n\"You can hear me, can\\'t you?\"\\n\\nThe eyelids flickered feebly.\\n\\nThe dying man was just breathing. Was there anything to be obtained from\\nthis faint semblance of life?\\n\\nThe policemen were attacking the door, the last rampart.\\n\\nSernine whispered.\\n\\n\"I will save you. . . . I have infallible remedies. . . . One word only\\n. . . Geneviève? . . .\"\\n\\nIt was as though this word of hope revived the man\\'s strength. Altenheim\\ntried to utter articulate sounds.\\n\\n\"Answer,\" said Sernine, persisting. \"Answer, and I will save you. . . .\\nAnswer. . . . It means your life to-day . . . your liberty to-morrow.\\n. . . Answer! . . .\"\\n\\nThe door shook under the blows that rained upon it.\\n\\nThe baron gasped out unintelligible syllables. Leaning over him,\\naffrighted, straining all his energy, all his will to the utmost,\\nSernine panted with anguish. He no longer gave a thought to the\\npolicemen, his inevitable capture, prison. . . . But Geneviève. . . .\\nGeneviève dying of hunger, whom one word from that villain could set\\nfree! . . .\\n\\n\"Answer! . . . You must! . . .\"\\n\\nHe ordered and entreated by turns. Altenheim stammered, as though\\nhypnotized and defeated by that indomitable imperiousness:\\n\\n\"Ri . . . Rivoli. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Rue de Rivoli, is that it? You have locked her up in a house in that\\nstreet . . . eh? Which number?\"\\n\\nA loud din . . . followed by shouts of triumph. . . . The door was down.\\n\\n\"Jump on him, lads!\" cried M. Weber. \"Seize him . . . seize both of\\nthem!\"\\n\\nAnd Sernine, on his knees:\\n\\n\"The number . . . answer. . . . If you love her, answer. . . . Why keep\\nsilence now?\"\\n\\n\"Twenty . . . twenty-seven,\" whispered the baron.\\n\\nHands were laid on Sernine. Ten revolvers were pointed at him.\\n\\nHe rose and faced the policemen, who fell back with instinctive dread.\\n\\n\"If you stir, Lupin,\" cried M. Weber, with his revolver leveled at him,\\n\"I\\'ll blow out your brains.\"\\'\\n\\n\"Don\\'t shoot.\" said Sernine, solemnly. \"It\\'s not necessary. I\\nsurrender.\"\\n\\n\"Humbug! This is another of your tricks!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Sernine, \"the battle is lost. You have no right to shoot.\\nI am not defending myself.\"\\n\\nHe took out two revolvers and threw them on the floor.\\n\\n\"Humbug!\" M. Weber repeated, implacably. \"Aim straight at his heart,\\nlads! At the least movement, fire! At the least word, fire!\"\\n\\nThere were ten men there. He placed five more in position. He pointed\\ntheir fifteen right arms at the mark. And, raging, shaking with joy and\\nfear, he snarled:\\n\\n\"At his heart! At his head! And no pity! If he stirs, if he speaks . . .\\nshoot him where he stands!\"\\n\\nSernine smiled, impassively, with his hands in his pockets. Death was\\nthere, waiting for him, at two inches from his chest, at two inches from\\nhis temples. Fifteen fingers were curled round the triggers.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" chuckled M. Weber, \"this is nice, this is very nice! . . . And I\\nthink that this time we\\'ve scored . . . and it\\'s a nasty look-out for\\nyou, Master Lupin! . . .\"\\n\\nHe made one of his men draw back the shutters of a large air-hole, which\\nadmitted a sudden burst of daylight, and he turned toward Altenheim.\\nBut, to his great amazement, the baron, whom he thought dead, opened his\\neyes, glazed, awful eyes, already filled with all the signs of the\\ncoming dissolution. He stared at M. Weber. Then he seemed to look for\\nsomebody and, catching sight of Sernine, had a convulsion of anger. He\\nseemed to be waking from his torpor; and his suddenly reviving hatred\\nrestored a part of his strength.\\n\\nHe raised himself on his two wrists and tried to speak.\\n\\n\"You know him, eh?\" asked M. Weber.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s Lupin, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. . . . Lupin. . . .\"\\n\\nSernine, still smiling, listened:\\n\\n\"Heavens, how I\\'m amusing myself!\" he declared.\\n\\n\"Have you anything more to say?\" asked M. Weber, who saw the baron\\'s\\nlips making desperate attempts to move.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"About M. Lenormand, perhaps?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Have you shut him up? Where? Answer! . . .\"\\n\\nWith all his heaving body, with all his tense glance, Altenheim pointed\\nto a cupboard in the corner of the room.\\n\\n\"There . . . there . . .\" he said.\\n\\n\"Ah, we\\'re burning!\" chuckled Lupin.\\n\\nM. Weber opened the cupboard. On one of the shelves was a parcel wrapped\\nin black cloth. He opened it and found a hat, a little box, some\\nclothes. . . . He gave a start. He had recognized M. Lenormand\\'s\\nolive-green frock-coat.\\n\\n\"Oh, the villains!\" he cried. \"They have murdered him!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Altenheim, shaking his head.\\n\\n\"Then . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s he . . . he . . .\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean by \\'he\\'? . . . Did Lupin kill the chief?\"\\n\\n\"No. . . .\"\\n\\nAltenheim was clinging to existence with fierce obstinacy, eager to\\nspeak and to accuse. . . . The secret which he wished to reveal was at\\nthe tip of his tongue and he was not able, did not know how to translate\\nit into words.\\n\\n\"Come,\" the deputy-chief insisted. \"M. Lenormand is dead, surely?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s alive?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand. . . . Look here, these clothes? This frock-coat?\\n. . .\"\\n\\nAltenheim turned his eyes toward Sernine. An idea struck M. Weber:\\n\\n\"Ah, I see! Lupin stole M. Lenormand\\'s clothes and reckoned upon using\\nthem to escape with. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes . . . yes. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Not bad,\" cried the deputy-chief. \"It\\'s quite a trick in his style. In\\nthis room, we should have found Lupin disguised as M. Lenormand, chained\\nup, no doubt. It would have meant his safety; only he hadn\\'t time.\\nThat\\'s it, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes . . . yes . . .\"\\n\\nBut, by the appearance of the dying man\\'s eyes, M. Weber felt that there\\nwas more, and that the secret was not exactly that. What was it, then?\\nWhat was the strange and unintelligible puzzle which Altenheim wanted to\\nexplain before dying?\\n\\nHe questioned him again:\\n\\n\"And where is M. Lenormand himself?\"\\n\\n\"There. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean? Here?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But there are only ourselves here!\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s . . . there\\'s . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh, speak!\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s . . . Ser . . . Sernine.\"\\n\\n\"Sernine! . . . Eh, what?\"\\n\\n\"Sernine . . . Lenormand. . . .\"\\n\\nM. Weber gave a jump. A sudden light flashed across him.\\n\\n\"No, no, it\\'s not possible,\" he muttered. \"This is madness.\"\\n\\nHe gave a side-glance at his prisoner. Sernine seemed to be greatly\\ndiverted and to be watching the scene with the air of a playgoer who is\\nthoroughly amused and very anxious to know how the piece is going to\\nend.\\n\\nAltenheim, exhausted by his efforts, had fallen back at full length.\\nWould he die before revealing the solution of the riddle which his\\nstrange words had propounded? M. Weber, shaken by an absurd, incredible\\nsurmise, which he did not wish to entertain and which persisted in his\\nmind in spite of him, made a fresh, determined attempt:\\n\\n\"Explain the thing to us. . . . What\\'s at the bottom of it? What\\nmystery?\"\\n\\nThe other seemed not to hear and lay lifeless, with staring eyes.\\n\\nM. Weber lay down beside him, with his body touching him, and, putting\\ngreat stress upon his words, so that each syllable should sink down to\\nthe very depths of that brain already merged in darkness, said:\\n\\n\"Listen. . . . I have understood you correctly, have I not? Lupin and M.\\nLenormand. . . .\"\\n\\nHe needed an effort to continue, so monstrous did the words appear to\\nhim. Nevertheless, the baron\\'s dimmed eyes seemed to contemplate him\\nwith anguish. He finished the sentence, shaking with excitement, as\\nthough he were speaking blasphemy:\\n\\n\"That\\'s it, isn\\'t it? You\\'re sure? The two are one and the same? . . .\"\\n\\nThe eyes did not move. A little blood trickled from one corner of the\\nman\\'s mouth. . . . He gave two or three sobs. . . . A last spasm; and\\nall was over . . .\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nA long silence reigned in that basement room filled with people.\\n\\nAlmost all the policemen guarding Sernine had turned round and,\\nstupefied, not understanding or not willing to understand, they still\\nlistened to the incredible accusation which the dying scoundrel had been\\nunable to put into words.\\n\\nM. Weber took the little box which was in the parcel and opened it. It\\ncontained a gray wig, a pair of spectacles, a maroon-colored neckerchief\\nand, in a false bottom, a pot or two of make-up and a case containing\\nsome tiny tufts of gray hair: in short, all that was needed to complete\\na perfect disguise in the character of M. Lenormand.\\n\\nHe went up to Sernine and, looking at him for a few seconds without\\nspeaking, thoughtfully reconstructing all the phases of the adventure,\\nhe muttered:\\n\\n\"So it\\'s true?\"\\n\\nSernine, who had retained his smiling calmness, replied:\\n\\n\"The suggestion is a pretty one and a bold one. But, before I answer,\\ntell your men to stop worrying me with those toys of theirs.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said M. Weber, making a sign to his men. \"And now answer.\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"Are you M. Lenormand?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nExclamations arose. Jean Doudeville, who was there, while his brother\\nwas watching the secret outlet, Jean Doudeville, Sernine\\'s own\\naccomplice, looked at him in dismay. M. Weber stood undecided.\\n\\n\"That takes your breath away, eh?\" said Sernine. \"I admit that it\\'s\\nrather droll. . . . Lord, how you used to make me laugh sometimes, when\\nwe were working together, you and I, the chief and the deputy-chief!\\n. . . And the funniest thing is that you thought our worthy M. Lenormand\\ndead . . . as well as poor Gourel. But no, no, old chap: there\\'s life in\\nthe old dog yet!\" He pointed to Altenheim\\'s corpse. \"There, it was that\\nscoundrel who pitched me into the water, in a sack, with a paving-stone\\nround my waist. Only, he forgot to take away my knife. And with a knife\\none rips open sacks and cuts ropes. So you see, you unfortunate\\nAltenheim: if you had thought of that, you wouldn\\'t be where you are!\\n. . . But enough said. . . . Peace to your ashes!\"\\n\\nM. Weber listened, not knowing what to think. At last, he made a gesture\\nof despair, as though he gave up the idea of forming a reasonable\\nopinion.\\n\\n\"The handcuffs,\" he said, suddenly alarmed.\\n\\n\"If it amuses you,\" said Sernine.\\n\\nAnd, picking out Doudeville in the front row of his assailants, he put\\nout his wrists:\\n\\n\"There, my friend, you shall have the honour . . . and don\\'t trouble to\\nexert yourself. . . . I\\'m playing square . . . as it\\'s no use doing\\nanything else. . . .\"\\n\\nHe said this in a tone that gave Doudeville to understand that the\\nstruggle was finished for the moment and that there was nothing to do\\nbut submit.\\n\\nDoudeville fastened the handcuffs.\\n\\nWithout moving his lips or contracting a muscle of his face, Sernine\\nwhispered:\\n\\n\"27, Rue de Rivoli . . . Geneviève. . . .\"\\n\\nM. Weber could not suppress a movement of satisfaction at the sight:\\n\\n\"Come along!\" he said. \"To the detective-office!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s it, to the detective-office!\" cried Sernine. \"M. Lenormand will\\nenter Arsène Lupin in the jail-book; and Arsène Lupin will enter Prince\\nSernine.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re too clever, Lupin.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true, Weber; we shall never get on, you and I.\"\\n\\nDuring the drive in the motor-car, escorted by three other cars filled\\nwith policemen, he did not utter a word.\\n\\nThey did not stay long at the detective office. M. Weber, remembering\\nthe escapes effected by Lupin, sent him up at once to the finger-print\\ndepartment and then took him to the Dépôt, whence he was sent on to the\\nSanté Prison.\\n\\nThe governor had been warned by telephone and was waiting for him. The\\nformalities of the entry of commitment and of the searching were soon\\ngot over; and, at seven o\\'clock in the evening, Prince Paul Sernine\\ncrossed the threshold of cell 14 in the second division:\\n\\n\"Not half bad, your rooms,\" he declared, \"not bad at all! . . . Electric\\nlight, central heating, every requisite . . . capital! Mr. Governor,\\nI\\'ll take this room.\"\\n\\nHe flung himself on the bed:\\n\\n\"Oh, Mr. Governor, I have one little favor to ask of you!\"\\n\\n\"What is that?\"\\n\\n\"Tell them not to bring me my chocolate before ten o\\'clock in the\\nmorning. . . . I\\'m awfully sleepy.\"\\n\\nHe turned his face to the wall. Five minutes later he was sound asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\"SANTÉ PALACE\"\\n\\n\\nThere was one wild burst of laughter over the whole face of the world.\\n\\nTrue, the capture of Arsène Lupin made a big sensation; and the public\\ndid not grudge the police the praise which they deserved for this\\nrevenge so long hoped-for and now so fully obtained. The great\\nadventurer was caught. That extraordinary, genial, invisible hero was\\nshivering, like any ordinary criminal, between the four walls of a\\nprison cell, crushed in his turn by that formidable power which is\\ncalled the law and which, sooner or later, by inevitable necessity\\nshatters the obstacles opposed to it and destroys the work of its\\nadversaries.\\n\\nAll this was said, printed, repeated and discussed _ad nauseam_. The\\nprefect of police was created a commander, M. Weber an officer of the\\nLegion of Honor. The skill and courage of their humblest coadjutors were\\nextolled to the skies. Cheers were raised and pæans of victory struck\\nup. Articles were written and speeches made.\\n\\nVery well. But one thing, nevertheless, rose above the wonderful concert\\nof praise, these noisy demonstrations of satisfaction; and that was an\\nimmense, spontaneous, inextinguishable and tumultuous roar of laughter.\\n\\nArsène Lupin had been chief of the detective-service for four years!!!\\n\\nHe had been chief detective for four years and, really, legally, he was\\nchief detective still, with all the rights which the title confers,\\nenjoying the esteem of his chiefs, the favor of the government and the\\nadmiration of the public.\\n\\nFor four years, the public peace and the defence of property had been\\nentrusted to Arsène Lupin. He saw that the law was carried out. He\\nprotected the innocent and pursued the guilty.\\n\\nAnd what services he had rendered! Never was order less disturbed, never\\nwas crime discovered with greater certainty and rapidity. The reader\\nneed but take back his mind to the Denizou case, the robbery at the\\nCrédit Lyonnais, the attack on the Orléans express, the murder of Baron\\nDorf, forming a series of unforeseen and overwhelming triumphs, of\\nmagnificent feats of prowess fit to compare with the most famous\\nvictories of the most renowned detectives.[6]\\n\\n[Footnote 6: The murder of Baron Dorf, that mysterious and disconcerting\\naffair, will one day be the subject of a story which will give an idea\\nof Arsène Lupin\\'s astonishing qualities as a detective.]\\n\\nNot so very long before, in a speech delivered at the time of the fire\\nat the Louvre and the capture of the incendiaries, Valenglay, the prime\\nminister, had said, speaking in defence of the somewhat arbitrary manner\\nin which M. Lenormand had acted on that occasion:\\n\\n\"With his great powers of discernment, his energy, his qualities of\\ndecision and execution, his unexpected methods, his inexhaustible\\nresources, M. Lenormand reminds us of the only man who, if he were still\\nalive, could hope to hold his own against him: I mean Arsène Lupin. M.\\nLenormand is an Arsène Lupin in the service of society.\"\\n\\nAnd, lo and behold, M. Lenormand was none other than Arsène Lupin!\\n\\nThat he was a Russian prince, who cared! Lupin was an old hand at such\\nchanges of personality as that. But chief detective! What a delicious\\nirony! What a whimsical humor in the conduct of that extraordinary life!\\n\\nM. Lenormand! . . . Arsène Lupin! . . .\\n\\nPeople were now able to explain to themselves the apparently miraculous\\nfeats of intelligence which had quite recently bewildered the crowd and\\nbaffled the police. They understood how his accomplice had been juggled\\naway in the middle of the Palais de Justice itself, in broad daylight\\nand on the appointed day. Had he himself not said:\\n\\n\"My process is so ingenious and so simple. . . . How surprised people\\nwill be on the day when I am free to speak! \\'Is that all?\\' I shall be\\nasked. That is all; but it had to be thought of.\"\\n\\nIt was, indeed, childishly simple: all you had to do was to be chief of\\nthe detective-service.\\n\\nWell, Lupin was chief of the detective-service; and every police-officer\\nobeying his orders had made himself the involuntary and unconscious\\naccomplice of Arsène Lupin.\\n\\nWhat a comedy! What admirable bluff! It was the monumental and consoling\\nfarce of these drab times of ours. Lupin in prison, Lupin irretrievably\\nconquered was, in spite of himself, the great conqueror. From his cell\\nhe shone over Paris. He was more than ever the idol, more than ever the\\nmaster.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nWhen Arsène Lupin awoke next morning, in his room at the \"Santé Palace,\"\\nas he at once nicknamed it, he had a very clear vision of the enormous\\nsensation which would be produced by his arrest under the double name of\\nSernine and Lenormand and the double title of prince and chief of the\\ndetective-service.\\n\\nHe rubbed his hands and gave vent to his thoughts:\\n\\n\"A man can have no better companion in his loneliness than the approval\\nof his contemporaries. O fame! The sun of all living men! . . .\"\\n\\nSeen by daylight, his cell pleased him even better than at night. The\\nwindow, placed high up in the wall, afforded a glimpse of the branches\\nof a tree, through which peeped the blue of the sky above. The walls\\nwere white. There was only one table and one chair, both fastened to the\\nfloor. But everything was quite nice and clean.\\n\\n\"Come,\" he said, \"a little rest-cure here will be rather charming. . . .\\nBut let us see to our toilet. . . . Have I all I want? . . . No. . . .\\nIn that case, ring twice for the chambermaid.\"\\n\\nHe pressed the button of an apparatus beside the door, which released a\\nsignaling-disc in the corridor.\\n\\nAfter a moment, bolts and bars were drawn outside, a key turned in the\\nlock and a warder appeared.\\n\\n\"Hot water, please,\" said Lupin.\\n\\nThe other looked at him with an air of mingled amazement and rage.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Lupin, \"and a bath-towel! By Jove, there\\'s no bath-towel!\"\\n\\nThe man growled:\\n\\n\"You\\'re getting at me, aren\\'t you? You\\'d better be careful!\"\\n\\nHe was going away, when Lupin caught him roughly by the arm:\\n\\n\"Here! A hundred francs if you\\'ll post a letter for me.\"\\n\\nHe took out a hundred-franc note, which he had concealed during the\\nsearch, and offered it to him.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the letter?\" said the warder, taking the money.\\n\\n\"Just give me a moment to write it.\"\\n\\nHe sat down at the table, scribbled a few words in pencil on a sheet of\\npaper, put it in an envelope and addressed the letter:\\n\\n      _\"To Monsieur S. B. 42,_\\n               _\"Poste Restante,_\\n                         \"PARIS.\"\\n\\nThe warder took the letter and walked away.\\n\\n\"That letter,\" said Lupin to himself, \"will reach destination as safely\\nas if I delivered it myself. I shall have the reply in an hour at\\nlatest: just the time I want to take a good look into my position.\"\\n\\nHe sat down on his chair and, in an undertone, summed up the situation\\nas follows:\\n\\n\"When all is said and done, I have two adversaries to fight at the\\npresent moment. There is, first, society, which holds me and which I can\\nafford to laugh at. Secondly, there is a person unknown, who does not\\nhold me, but whom I am not inclined to laugh at in the very least. It is\\nhe who told the police that I was Sernine. It was he who guessed that I\\nwas M. Lenormand. It was he who locked the door of the underground\\npassage and it was he who had me clapped into prison.\"\\n\\nArsène Lupin reflected for a second and then continued:\\n\\n\"So, at long last, the struggle lies between him and me. And, to keep up\\nthat struggle, that is to say, to discover and get to the bottom of the\\nKesselbach case, here am I, a prisoner, while he is free, unknown, and\\ninaccessible, and holds the two trump-cards which I considered mine:\\nPierre Leduc and old Steinweg. . . . In short, he is near the goal,\\nafter finally pushing me back.\"\\n\\nA fresh contemplative pause, followed by a fresh soliloquy:\\n\\n\"The position is far from brilliant. On the one side, everything; on the\\nother, nothing. Opposite me, a man of my own strength, or stronger,\\nbecause he has not the same scruples that hamper me. And I am without\\nweapons to attack him with.\"\\n\\nHe repeated the last sentence several times, in a mechanical voice, and\\nthen stopped and, taking his forehead between his hands, sat for a long\\ntime wrapped in thought.\\n\\n\"Come in, Mr. Governor,\" he said, seeing the door open.\\n\\n\"Were you expecting me?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I wrote to you, Mr. Governor, asking you to come! I felt certain\\nthat the warder would give you my letter. I was so certain of it that I\\nput your initials, S. B., and your age, forty-two, on the envelope!\"\\n\\nThe governor\\'s name, in point of fact, was Stanislas Borély, and he was\\nforty-two years of age. He was a pleasant-looking man, with a very\\ngentle character, who treated the prisoners with all the indulgence\\npossible.\\n\\nHe said to Lupin:\\n\\n\"Your opinion of my subordinate\\'s integrity was quite correct. Here is\\nyour money. It shall be handed to you at your release. . . . You will\\nnow go through the searching-room again.\"\\n\\nLupin went with M. Borély to the little room reserved for this purpose,\\nundressed and, while his clothes were inspected with justifiable\\nsuspicion, himself underwent a most fastidious examination.\\n\\nHe was then taken back to his cell and M. Borély said:\\n\\n\"I feel easier. That\\'s done.\"\\n\\n\"And very well done, Mr. Governor. Your men perform this sort of duty\\nwith a delicacy for which I should like to thank them by giving them a\\nsmall token of my satisfaction.\"\\n\\nHe handed a hundred-franc note to M. Borély, who jumped as though he had\\nbeen shot:\\n\\n\"Oh! . . . But . . . where does that come from?\"\\n\\n\"No need to rack your brains, Mr. Governor. A man like myself, leading\\nthe life that I do, is always prepared for any eventuality: and no\\nmishap, however painful--not even imprisonment--can take him unawares.\"\\n\\nSeizing the middle finger of his left hand between the thumb and\\nforefinger of the right, he pulled it off smartly and presented it\\ncalmly to M. Borély:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t start like that, Mr. Governor. This is not my finger, but just a\\ntube, made of gold-beater\\'s skin and cleverly colored, which fits\\nexactly over my middle finger and gives the illusion of a real finger.\"\\nAnd he added, with a laugh, \"In such a way, of course, as to conceal a\\nthird hundred-franc note. . . . What is a poor man to do? He must carry\\nthe best purse he can . . . and must needs make use of it on occasions.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nHe stopped at the sight of M. Borély\\'s startled face:\\n\\n\"Please don\\'t think, Mr. Governor, that I wish to dazzle you with my\\nlittle parlor-tricks. I only wanted to show you that you have to do with\\na . . . client of a rather . . . special nature and to tell you that you\\nmust not be surprised if I venture, now and again, to break the ordinary\\nrules and regulations of your establishment.\"\\n\\nThe governor had recovered himself. He said plainly:\\n\\n\"I prefer to think that you will conform to the rules and not compel me\\nto resort to harsh measures. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Which you would regret to have to enforce: isn\\'t that it, Mr. Governor?\\nThat\\'s just what I should like to spare you, by proving to you in\\nadvance that they would not prevent me from doing as I please: from\\ncorresponding with my friends, from defending the grave interests\\nconfided to me outside these walls, from writing to the newspapers that\\naccept my inspiration, from pursuing the fulfilment of my plans and,\\nlastly, from preparing my escape.\"\\n\\n\"Your escape!\"\\n\\nLupin began to laugh heartily:\\n\\n\"But think, Mr. Governor, my only excuse for being in prison is . . . to\\nleave it!\"\\n\\nThe argument did not appear to satisfy M. Borély. He made an effort to\\nlaugh in his turn:\\n\\n\"Forewarned is forearmed,\" he said.\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I wanted,\" Lupin replied. \"Take all your precautions, Mr.\\nGovernor, neglect nothing, so that later they may have nothing to\\nreproach you with. On the other hand, I shall arrange things in such a\\nway that, whatever annoyance you may have to bear in consequence of my\\nescape, your career, at least, shall not suffer. That is all I had to\\nsay to you, Mr. Governor. You can go.\"\\n\\nAnd, while M. Borély walked away, greatly perturbed by his singular\\ncharge and very anxious about the events in preparation, the prisoner\\nthrew himself on his bed, muttering:\\n\\n\"What cheek, Lupin, old fellow, what cheek! Really, any one would think\\nthat you had some idea as to how you were going to get out of this!\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe Santé prison is built on the star plan. In the centre of the main\\nportion is a round hall, upon which all the corridors converge, so that\\nno prisoner is able to leave his cell without being at once perceived by\\nthe overseers posted in the glass box which occupies the middle of that\\ncentral hall.\\n\\nThe thing that most surprises the visitor who goes over the prison is\\nthat, at every moment, he will meet prisoners without a guard of any\\nkind, who seem to move about as though they were absolutely free. In\\nreality, in order to go from one point to another--for instance, from\\ntheir cell to the van waiting in the yard to take them to the Palais de\\nJustice for the magistrate\\'s examination--they pass along straight lines\\neach of which ends in a door that is opened to them by a warder. The\\nsole duty of the warder is to open and shut this door and to watch the\\ntwo straight lines which it commands. And thus the prisoners, while\\napparently at liberty to come and go as they please, are sent from door\\nto door, from eye to eye, like so many parcels passed from hand to hand.\\n\\nOutside, municipal guards receive the object and pack it into one of\\nthe compartments of the \"salad-basket.\"[7]\\n\\n[Footnote 7: The French slang expression for its prison-van or \"black\\nMaria.\"--_Translator\\'s Note._]\\n\\nThis is the ordinary routine.\\n\\nIn Lupin\\'s case it was disregarded entirely. The police were afraid of\\nthat walk along the corridors. They were afraid of the prison-van. They\\nwere afraid of everything.\\n\\nM. Weber came in person, accompanied by twelve constables--the best he\\nhad, picked men, armed to the teeth--fetched the formidable prisoner at\\nthe door of his cell and took him in a cab, the driver of which was one\\nof his own men, with mounted municipal guards trotting on each side, in\\nfront and behind.\\n\\n\"Bravo!\" cried Lupin. \"I am quite touched by the compliment paid me. A\\nguard of honor. By Jove, Weber, you have the proper hierarchical\\ninstinct! You don\\'t forget what is due to your immediate chief.\" And,\\ntapping him on the shoulder: \"Weber, I intend to send in my resignation.\\nI shall name you as my successor.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s almost done,\" said Weber.\\n\\n\"That\\'s good news! I was a little anxious about my escape. Now I am easy\\nin my mind. From the moment when Weber is chief of the detective-service\\n. . . !\"\\n\\nM. Weber did not reply to the gibe. At heart, he had a queer, complex\\nfeeling in the presence of his adversary, a feeling made up of the fear\\nwith which Lupin inspired him, the deference which he entertained for\\nPrince Sernine and the respectful admiration which he had always shown\\nto M. Lenormand. All this was mingled with spite, envy and satisfied\\nhatred.\\n\\nThey arrived at the Palais de Justice. At the foot of the \"mouse-trap,\"\\na number of detectives were waiting, among whom M. Weber rejoiced to see\\nhis best two lieutenants, the brothers Doudeville.\\n\\n\"Has M. Formerie come?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes, chief, Monsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction is in his room.\"\\n\\nM. Weber went up the stairs, followed by Lupin, who had the Doudevilles\\non either side of him.\\n\\n\"Geneviève?\" whispered the prisoner.\\n\\n\"Saved. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Where is she?\"\\n\\n\"With her grandmother.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Kesselbach?\"\\n\\n\"In Paris, at the Bristol.\"\\n\\n\"Suzanne?\"\\n\\n\"Disappeared.\"\\n\\n\"Steinweg?\"\\n\\n\"Released.\"\\n\\n\"What has he told you?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing. Won\\'t make any revelations except to you.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"We told him he owed his release to you.\"\\n\\n\"Newspapers good this morning?\"\\n\\n\"Excellent.\"\\n\\n\"Good. If you want to write to me, here are my instructions.\"\\n\\nThey had reached the inner corridor on the first floor and Lupin slipped\\na pellet of paper into the hand of one of the brothers.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nM. Formerie uttered a delicious phrase when Lupin entered his room\\naccompanied by the deputy-chief:\\n\\n\"Ah, there you are! I knew we should lay hands on you some day or\\nother!\"\\n\\n\"So did I, Monsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction,\" said Lupin, \"and I am glad\\nthat you have been marked out by fate to do justice to the honest man\\nthat I am.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s getting at me,\" thought M. Formerie. And, in the same ironical and\\nserious tone as Lupin, he retorted, \"The honest man that you are, sir,\\nwill be asked what he has to say about three hundred and forty-four\\nseparate cases of larceny, burglary, swindling and forgery, blackmail,\\nreceiving and so on. Three hundred and forty-four!\"\\n\\n\"What! Is that all?\" cried Lupin. \"I really feel quite ashamed.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t distress yourself! I shall discover more. But let us proceed in\\norder. Arsène Lupin, in spite of all our inquiries, we have no definite\\ninformation as to your real name.\"\\n\\n\"How odd! No more have I!\"\\n\\n\"We are not even in a position to declare that you are the same Arsène\\nLupin who was confined in the Santé a few years back, and from there\\nmade his first escape.\"\\n\\n\"\\'His first escape\\' is good, and does you credit.\"\\n\\n\"It so happens, in fact,\" continued M. Formerie, \"that the Arsène Lupin\\ncard in the measuring department gives a description of Arsène Lupin\\nwhich differs at all points from your real description.\"\\n\\n\"How more and more odd!\"\\n\\n\"Different marks, different measurements, different finger-prints. . . .\\nThe two photographs even are quite unlike. I will therefore ask you to\\nsatisfy us as to your exact identity.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just what I was going to ask you. I have lived under so many\\ndistinct names that I have ended by forgetting my own. I don\\'t know\\nwhere I am.\"\\n\\n\"So I must enter a refusal to answer?\"\\n\\n\"An inability.\"\\n\\n\"Is this a thought-out plan? Am I to expect the same silence in reply to\\nall my questions?\"\\n\\n\"Very nearly.\"\\n\\n\"And why?\"\\n\\nLupin struck a solemn attitude and said:\\n\\n\"M. le Juge d\\'Instruction, my life belongs to history. You have only to\\nturn over the annals of the past fifteen years and your curiosity will\\nbe satisfied. So much for my part. As to the rest, it does not concern\\nme: it is an affair between you and the murderers at the Palace Hotel.\"\\n\\n\"Arsène Lupin, the honest man that you are will have to-day to explain\\nthe murder of Master Altenheim.\"\\n\\n\"Hullo, this is new! Is the idea yours, Monsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction?\"\\n\\n\"Exactly.\"\\n\\n\"Very clever! Upon my word, M. Formerie, you\\'re getting on!\"\\n\\n\"The position in which you were captured leaves no doubt.\"\\n\\n\"None at all; only, I will venture to ask you this: what sort of wound\\ndid Altenheim die of?\"\\n\\n\"Of a wound in the throat caused by a knife.\"\\n\\n\"And where is the knife?\"\\n\\n\"It has not been found.\"\\n\\n\"How could it not have been found, if I had been the assassin,\\nconsidering that I was captured beside the very man whom I am supposed\\nto have killed?\"\\n\\n\"Who killed him, according to you?\"\\n\\n\"The same man that killed Mr. Kesselbach, Chapman, and Beudot. The\\nnature of the wound is a sufficient proof.\"\\n\\n\"How did he get away?\"\\n\\n\"Through a trap-door, which you will discover in the room where the\\ntragedy took place.\"\\n\\nM. Formerie assumed an air of slyness:\\n\\n\"And how was it that you did not follow that useful example?\"\\n\\n\"I tried to follow it. But the outlet was blocked by a door which I\\ncould not open. It was during this attempt that \\'the other one\\' came\\nback to the room and killed his accomplice for fear of the revelations\\nwhich he would have been sure to make. At the same time, he hid in a\\ncupboard, where it was subsequently found, the parcel of clothes which I\\nhad prepared.\"\\n\\n\"What were those clothes for?\"\\n\\n\"To disguise myself. When I went to the Glycines my plan was this: to\\nhand Altenheim over to the police, to suppress my own identity as Prince\\nSernine and to reappear under the features. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Of M. Lenormand, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Exactly.\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"What!\"\\n\\nM. Formerie gave a knowing smile and wagged his forefinger from left to\\nright and right to left:\\n\\n\"No,\" he repeated.\\n\\n\"What do you mean by \\'no\\'?\"\\n\\n\"That story about M. Lenormand. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"Will do for the public, my friend. But you won\\'t make M. Formerie\\nswallow that Lupin and Lenormand were one and the same man.\" He burst\\nout laughing. \"Lupin, chief of the detective-service! No, anything you\\nlike, but not that! . . . There are limits. . . . I am an easy-going\\nfellow. . . . I\\'ll believe anything . . . but still. . . . Come, between\\nourselves, what was the reason of this fresh hoax? . . . I confess I\\ncan\\'t see . . .\"\\n\\nLupin looked at him in astonishment. In spite of all that he knew of M.\\nFormerie, he could not conceive such a degree of infatuation and\\nblindness. There was at that moment only one person in the world who\\nrefused to believe in Prince Sernine\\'s double personality; and that was\\nM. Formerie! . . .\\n\\nLupin turned to the deputy-chief, who stood listening open-mouthed:\\n\\n\"My dear Weber, I fear your promotion is not so certain as I thought.\\nFor, you see, if M. Lenormand is not myself, then he exists . . . and,\\nif he exists, I have no doubt that M. Formerie, with all his acumen,\\nwill end by discovering him . . . in which case . . .\"\\n\\n\"We shall discover him all right, M. Lupin,\" cried the\\nexamining-magistrate. \"I\\'ll undertake that, and I tell you that, when\\nyou and he are confronted, we shall see some fun.\" He chuckled and\\ndrummed with his fingers on the table. \"How amusing! Oh, one\\'s never\\nbored when you\\'re there, that I\\'ll say for you! So you\\'re M. Lenormand,\\nand it\\'s you who arrested your accomplice Marco!\"\\n\\n\"Just so! Wasn\\'t it my duty to please the prime minister and save the\\ncabinet? The fact is historical.\"\\n\\nM. Formerie held his sides:\\n\\n\"Oh, I shall die of laughing, I know I shall! Lord, what a joke! That\\nanswer will travel round the world. So, according to your theory, it was\\nwith you that I made the first enquiries at the Palace Hotel after the\\nmurder of Mr. Kesselbach? . . .\"\\n\\n\"Surely it was with me that you investigated the case of the stolen\\ncoronet when I was Duc de Chamerace,\"[8] retorted Lupin, in a sarcastic\\nvoice.\\n\\n[Footnote 8: See _Arsène Lupin_ by Edgar Jepson and Maurice Leblanc.]\\n\\nM. Formerie gave a start. All his merriment was dispelled by that odious\\nrecollection. Turning suddenly grave, he asked:\\n\\n\"So you persist in that absurd theory?\"\\n\\n\"I must, because it is the truth. It would be easy for you to take a\\nsteamer to Cochin-China and to find at Saigon the proofs of the death of\\nthe real M. Lenormand, the worthy man whom I replaced and whose\\ndeath-certificate I can show you.\"\\n\\n\"Humbug!\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Monsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction, I don\\'t care one way or\\nthe other. If it annoys you that I should be M. Lenormand, don\\'t let\\'s\\ntalk about it. We won\\'t talk about myself; we won\\'t talk about anything\\nat all, if you prefer. Besides, of what use can it be to you? The\\nKesselbach case is such a tangled affair that I myself don\\'t know where\\nI stand. There\\'s only one man who might help you. I have not succeeded\\nin discovering him. And I don\\'t think that you . . .\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the man\\'s name?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s an old man, a German called Steinweg. . . . But, of course, you\\'ve\\nheard about him, Weber, and the way in which he was carried off in the\\nmiddle of the Palais de Justice?\"\\n\\nM. Formerie threw an inquiring glance at the deputy-chief. M. Weber\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"I undertake to bring that person to you, Monsieur le Juge\\nd\\'Instruction.\"\\n\\n\"So that\\'s done,\" said M. Formerie, rising from his chair. \"As you see,\\nLupin, this was merely a formal examination to bring the two duelists\\ntogether. Now that we have crossed swords, all that we need is the\\nnecessary witness of our fencing-match, your counsel.\"\\n\\n\"Tut! Is it indispensable?\"\\n\\n\"Indispensable.\"\\n\\n\"Employ counsel in view of such an unlikely trial?\"\\n\\n\"You must.\"\\n\\n\"In that case, I\\'ll choose Maître Quimbel.\"\\n\\n\"The president of the corporation of the bar. You are wise, you will be\\nwell defended.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe first sitting was over. M. Weber led the prisoner away.\\n\\nAs he went down the stairs of the \"mouse-trap,\" between the two\\nDoudevilles, Lupin said, in short, imperative sentences:\\n\\n\"Watch Steinweg. . . . Don\\'t let him speak to anybody. . . . Be there\\nto-morrow. . . . I\\'ll give you some letters . . . one for you . . .\\nimportant.\"\\n\\nDownstairs, he walked up to the municipal guards surrounding the\\ntaxi-cab:\\n\\n\"Home, boys,\" he exclaimed, \"and quick about it! I have an appointment\\nwith myself for two o\\'clock precisely.\"\\n\\nThere were no incidents during the drive. On returning to his cell,\\nLupin wrote a long letter, full of detailed instructions, to the\\nbrothers Doudeville and, two other letters.\\n\\nOne was for Geneviève:\\n\\n      \"Geneviève, you now know who I am and you will\\n      understand why I concealed from you the name of him\\n      who twice carried you away in his arms when you were a\\n      little girl.\\n\\n      \"Geneviève, I was your mother\\'s friend, a distant\\n      friend, of whose double life she knew nothing, but\\n      upon whom she thought that she could rely. And that is\\n      why, before dying, she wrote me a few lines asking me\\n      to watch over you.\\n\\n      \"Unworthy as I am of your esteem, Geneviève, I shall\\n      continue faithful to that trust. Do not drive me from\\n      your heart entirely.\\n\\n                                   \"ARSÈNE LUPIN.\"\\n\\nThe other letter was addressed to Dolores Kesselbach:\\n\\n      \"Prince Sernine was led to seek Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s\\n      acquaintance by motives of self-interest alone. But a\\n      great longing to devote himself to her was the cause\\n      of his continuing it.\\n\\n      \"Now that Prince Sernine has become merely Arsène\\n      Lupin, he begs Mrs. Kesselbach not to deprive him of\\n      the right of protecting her, at a distance and as a\\n      man protects one whom he will never see again.\"\\n\\nThere were some envelopes on the table. He took up one and took up a\\nsecond; then, when he took up the third, he noticed a sheet of white\\npaper, the presence of which surprised him and which had words stuck\\nupon it, evidently cut out of a newspaper. He read:\\n\\n      \"You have failed in your fight with the baron. Give up\\n      interesting yourself in the case, and I will not\\n      oppose your escape.\\n\\n                                           \"L. M.\"\\n\\nOnce more, Lupin had that sense of repulsion and terror with which this\\nnameless and fabulous being always inspired him, a sense of disgust\\nwhich one feels at touching a venomous animal, a reptile:\\n\\n\"He again,\" he said. \"Even here!\"\\n\\nThat also scared him, the sudden vision which he at times received of\\nthis hostile power, a power as great as his own and disposing of\\nformidable means, the extent of which he himself was unable to realize.\\n\\nHe at once suspected his warder. But how had it been possible to corrupt\\nthat hard-featured, stern-eyed man?\\n\\n\"Well, so much the better, after all!\" he cried. \"I have never had to do\\nexcept with dullards. . . . In order to fight myself, I had to chuck\\nmyself into the command of the detective-service. . . . This time, I\\nhave some one to deal with! . . . Here\\'s a man who puts me in his pocket\\n. . . by sleight of hand, one might say. . . . If I succeed, from my\\nprison cell, in avoiding his blows and smashing him, in seeing old\\nSteinweg and dragging his confession from him, in setting the Kesselbach\\ncase on its legs and turning the whole of it into cash, in defending\\nMrs. Kesselbach and winning fortune and happiness for Geneviève . . .\\nwell, then Lupin will be Lupin still! . . .\"\\n\\nEleven days passed. On the twelfth day, Lupin woke very early and\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n\"Let me see, if my calculations are correct and if the gods are on my\\nside, there will be some news to-day. I have had four interviews with\\nFormerie. The fellow must be worked up to the right point now. And the\\nDoudevilles, on their side, must have been busy. . . . We shall have\\nsome fun!\"\\n\\nHe flung out his fists to right and left, brought them back to his\\nchest, then flung them out again and brought them back again.\\n\\nThis movement, which executed thirty times in succession, was followed\\nby a bending of his body backwards and forwards. Next came an alternate\\nlifting of the legs and then an alternate swinging of the arms.\\n\\nThe whole performance occupied a quarter of an hour, the quarter of an\\nhour which he devoted every morning to Swedish exercises to keep his\\nmuscles in condition.\\n\\nThen he sat down to his table, took up some sheets of white paper, which\\nwere arranged in numbered packets, and, folding one of them, made it\\ninto an envelope, a work which he continued to do with a series of\\nsuccessive sheets. It was the task which he had accepted and which he\\nforced himself to do daily, the prisoners having the right to choose the\\nlabor which they preferred: sticking envelopes, making paper fans, metal\\npurses, and so on. . . .\\n\\nAnd, in this way, while occupying his hands with an automatic exercise\\nand keeping his muscles supple with mechanical bendings, Lupin was able\\nto have his thoughts constantly fixed on his affairs. . . .\\n\\nAnd his affairs were complicated enough, in all conscience!\\n\\nThere was one, for instance, which surpassed all the others in\\nimportance, and for which he had to employ all the resources of his\\ngenius. How was he to have a long, quiet conversation with old Steinweg?\\nThe necessity was immediate. In a few days, Steinweg would have\\nrecovered from his imprisonment, would receive interviews, might blab\\n. . . to say nothing of the inevitable interference of the enemy, \\'the\\nother one.\\' And it was essential that Steinweg\\'s secret, Pierre Leduc\\'s\\nsecret, should be revealed to no one but Lupin. Once published, the\\nsecret lost all its value. . . .\\n\\nThe bolts grated, the key turned noisily in the lock.\\n\\n\"Ah, it\\'s you, most excellent of jailers! Has the moment come for the\\nlast toilet? The hair-cut that precedes the great final cut of all?\"\\n\\n\"Magistrate\\'s examination,\" said the man, laconically.\\n\\nLupin walked through the corridors of the prison and was received by the\\nmunicipal guards, who locked him into the prison-van.\\n\\nHe reached the Palais de Justice twenty minutes later. One of the\\nDoudevilles was waiting near the stairs. As they went up, he said to\\nLupin:\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be confronted to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Everything settled?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Weber?\"\\n\\n\"Busy elsewhere.\"\\n\\nLupin walked into M. Formerie\\'s room and at once recognized old\\nSteinweg, sitting on a chair, looking ill and wretched. A municipal\\nguard was standing behind him.\\n\\nM. Formerie scrutinized the prisoner attentively, as though he hoped to\\ndraw important conclusions from his contemplation of him, and said:\\n\\n\"You know who this gentleman is?\"\\n\\n\"Why, Steinweg, of course! . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, thanks to the active inquiries of M. Weber and of his two\\nofficers, the brothers Doudeville, we have found Mr. Steinweg, who,\\naccording to you, knows the ins and outs of the Kesselbach case, the\\nname of the murderer and all the rest of it.\"\\n\\n\"I congratulate you, Monsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction. Your examination\\nwill go swimmingly.\"\\n\\n\"I think so. There is only one \\'but\\': Mr. Steinweg refuses to reveal\\nanything, except in your presence.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I never! How odd of him! Does Arsène Lupin inspire him with so\\nmuch affection and esteem?\"\\n\\n\"Not Arsène Lupin, but Prince Sernine, who, he says, saved his life, and\\nM. Lenormand, with whom, he says, he began a conversation. . . .\"\\n\\n\"At the time when I was chief of the detective-service,\" Lupin broke in.\\n\"So you consent to admit.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Steinweg,\" said the magistrate, \"do you recognize M. Lenormand?\"\\n\\n\"No, but I know that Arsène Lupin and he are one.\"\\n\\n\"So you consent to speak?\"\\n\\n\"Yes . . . but . . . we are not alone.\"\\n\\n\"How do you mean? There is only my clerk here . . . and the guard . . .\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction, the secret which I am about to reveal\\nis so important that you yourself would be sorry . . .\"\\n\\n\"Guard, go outside, please,\" said M. Formerie. \"Come back at once, if I\\ncall. Do you object to my clerk, Steinweg?\"\\n\\n\"No, no . . . it might be better . . . but, however . . .\"\\n\\n\"Then speak. For that matter, nothing that you reveal will be put down\\nin black on white. One word more, though: I ask you for the last time,\\nis it indispensable that the prisoner should be present at this\\ninterview?\"\\n\\n\"Quite indispensable. You will see the reason for yourself.\"\\n\\nHe drew the chair up to the magistrate\\'s desk, Lupin remained standing,\\nnear the clerk. And the old man, speaking in a loud voice, said:\\n\\n\"It is now ten years since a series of circumstances, which I need not\\nenter into, made me acquainted with an extraordinary story in which two\\npersons are concerned.\"\\n\\n\"Their names, please.\"\\n\\n\"I will give the names presently. For the moment, let me say that one of\\nthese persons occupies an exceptional position in France, and that the\\nother, an Italian, or rather a Spaniard . . . yes, a Spaniard . . .\"\\n\\nA bound across the room, followed by two formidable blows of the fist.\\n. . . Lupin\\'s two arms had darted out to right and left, as though\\nimpelled by springs and his two fists, hard as cannon balls, caught the\\nmagistrate and his clerk on the jaw, just below the ear.\\n\\nThe magistrate and the clerk collapsed over their tables, in two lumps,\\nwithout a moan.\\n\\n\"Well hit!\" said Lupin. \"That was a neat bit of work.\"\\n\\nHe went to the door and locked it softly. Then returning:\\n\\n\"Steinweg, have you the chloroform?\"\\n\\n\"Are you quite sure that they have fainted?\" asks the old man, trembling\\nwith fear.\\n\\n\"What do you think! But it will only last for three or four minutes.\\n. . . And that is not long enough.\"\\n\\nThe German produced from his pocket a bottle and two pads of\\ncotton-wool, ready prepared.\\n\\nLupin uncorked the bottle, poured a few drops of the chloroform on the\\ntwo pads and held them to the noses of the magistrate and his clerk.\\n\\n\"Capital! We have ten minutes of peace and quiet before us. That will\\ndo, but let\\'s make haste, all the same; and not a word too much, old\\nman, do you hear?\" He took him by the arm. \"You see what I am able to\\ndo. Here we are, alone in the very heart of the Palais de Justice,\\nbecause I wished it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the old man.\\n\\n\"So you are going to tell me your secret?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I told it to Kesselbach, because he was rich and could turn it to\\nbetter account than anybody I knew; but, prisoner and absolutely\\npowerless though you are, I consider you a hundred times as strong as\\nKesselbach with his hundred millions.\"\\n\\n\"In that case, speak; and let us take things in their proper order. The\\nname of the murderer?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s impossible.\"\\n\\n\"How do you mean, impossible? I thought you knew it and were going to\\ntell me everything!\"\\n\\n\"Everything, but not that.\"\\n\\n\"But . . .\"\\n\\n\"Later on.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re mad! Why?\"\\n\\n\"I have no proofs. Later, when you are free, we will hunt together.\\nBesides, what\\'s the good? And then, really, I can\\'t tell you.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re afraid of him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Lupin. \"After all, that\\'s not the most urgent matter.\\nAs to the rest, you\\'ve made up your mind to speak?\"\\n\\n\"Without reserve.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, answer. Who is Pierre Leduc?\"\\n\\n\"Hermann IV., Grand Duke of Zweibrucken-Veldenz, Prince of Berncastel,\\nCount of Fistingen, Lord of Wiesbaden and other places.\"\\n\\nLupin felt a thrill of joy at learning that his _protégé_ was definitely\\nnot the son of a pork-butcher!\\n\\n\"The devil!\" he muttered. \"So we have a handle to our name! . . . As far\\nas I remember, the Grand-duchy of Zweibrucken-Veldenz is in Prussia?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, on the Moselle. The house of Veldenz is a branch of the Palatine\\nhouse of Zweibrucken. The grand-duchy was occupied by the French after\\nthe peace of Luneville and formed part of the department of\\nMont-Tonnerre. In 1814, it was restored in favor of Hermann I., the\\ngreat grandfather of Pierre Leduc. His son, Hermann II., spent a riotous\\nyouth, ruined himself, squandered the finances of his country and made\\nhimself impossible to his subjects, who ended by partly burning the old\\ncastle at Veldenz and driving their sovereign out of his dominions. The\\ngrand-duchy was then administered and governed by three regents, in the\\nname of Hermann II., who, by a curious anomaly, did not abdicate, but\\nretained his title as reigning grand-duke. He lived, rather short of\\ncash, in Berlin; later, he fought in the French war, by the side of\\nBismarck, of whom he was a friend. He was killed by a shell at the siege\\nof Paris and, in dying, entrusted Bismarck with the charge of his son\\nHermann, that is, Hermann III.\"\\n\\n\"The father, therefore, of our Leduc,\" said Lupin.\\n\\n\"Yes. The chancellor took a liking to Hermann III., and used often to\\nemploy him as a secret envoy to persons of distinction abroad. At the\\nfall of his patron Hermann III., left Berlin, travelled about and\\nreturned and settled in Dresden. When Bismarck died, Hermann III., was\\nthere. He himself died two years later. These are public facts, known to\\neverybody in Germany; and that is the story of the three Hermanns,\\nGrand-dukes of Zweibrucken-Veldenz in the nineteenth century.\"\\n\\n\"But the fourth, Hermann IV., the one in whom we are interested?\"\\n\\n\"We will speak of him presently. Let us now pass on to unknown facts.\"\\n\\n\"Facts known to you alone,\" said Lupin.\\n\\n\"To me alone and to a few others.\"\\n\\n\"How do you mean, a few others? Hasn\\'t the secret been kept?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, the secret has been well kept by all who know it. Have no\\nfear; it is very much to their interest, I assure you, not to divulge\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Then how do you know it?\"\\n\\n\"Through an old servant and private secretary of the Grand-duke Hermann,\\nthe last of the name. This servant, who died in my arms in South Africa,\\nbegan by confiding to me that his master was secretly married and had\\nleft a son behind him. Then he told me the great secret.\"\\n\\n\"The one which you afterwards revealed to Kesselbach.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"One second . . . Will you excuse me? . . .\"\\n\\nLupin bent over M. Formerie, satisfied himself that all was well and the\\nheart beating normally, and said:\\n\\n\"Go on.\"\\n\\nSteinweg resumed:\\n\\n\"On the evening of the day on which Bismarck died, the Grand-duke\\nHermann III. and his faithful manservant--my South African friend--took\\na train which brought them to Munich in time to catch the express for\\nVienna. From Vienna, they went to Constantinople, then to Cairo, then to\\nNaples, then to Tunis, then to Spain, then to Paris, then to London, to\\nSt. Petersburg, to Warsaw . . . and in none of these towns did they\\nstop. They took a cab, had their two bags put on the top, rushed through\\nthe streets, hurried to another station or to the landing-stage, and\\nonce more took the train or the steamer.\"\\n\\n\"In short, they were being followed and were trying to put their\\npursuers off the scent,\" Arsène Lupin concluded.\\n\\n\"One evening, they left the city of Treves, dressed in workmen\\'s caps\\nand linen jackets, each with a bundle slung over his shoulder at the end\\nof a stick. They covered on foot the twenty-two miles to Veldenz, where\\nthe old Castle of Zweibrucken stands, or rather the ruins of the old\\ncastle.\"\\n\\n\"No descriptions, please.\"\\n\\n\"All day long, they remained hidden in a neighboring forest. At night,\\nthey went up to the old walls. Hermann ordered his servant to wait for\\nhim and himself scaled the wall at a breach known as the Wolf\\'s Gap. He\\nreturned in an hour\\'s time. In the following week, after more\\nperegrinations, he went back home to Dresden. The expedition was over.\"\\n\\n\"And what was the object of the expedition?\"\\n\\n\"The grand-duke never breathed a word about it to his servant. But\\ncertain particulars and the coincidence of facts that ensued enabled the\\nman to build up the truth, at least, in part.\"\\n\\n\"Quick, Steinweg, time is running short now: and I am eager to know.\"\\n\\n\"A fortnight after the expedition, Count von Waldemar, an officer in the\\nEmperor\\'s body-guard and one of his personal friends, called on the\\ngrand-duke, accompanied by six men. He was there all day, locked up with\\nthe grand-duke in his study. There were repeated sounds of altercations,\\nof violent disputes. One phrase even was overheard by the servant, who\\nwas passing through the garden, under the windows: \\'Those papers were\\nhanded to you; His imperial Majesty is sure of it. If you refuse to give\\nthem to me of your own free will . . .\\' The rest of the sentence, the\\nmeaning of the threat and, for that matter, the whole scene can be\\neasily guessed by what followed; Hermann\\'s house was ransacked from top\\nto bottom.\"\\n\\n\"But that is against the law.\"\\n\\n\"It would have been against the law if the grand-duke had objected; but\\nhe himself accompanied the count in his search.\"\\n\\n\"And what were they looking for? The chancellor\\'s memoirs?\"\\n\\n\"Something better than that. They were looking for a parcel of secret\\ndocuments which were known to exist, owing to indiscretions that had\\nbeen committed, and which were known for certain to have been entrusted\\nto the Grand-duke Hermann\\'s keeping.\"\\n\\nLupin muttered, excitedly:\\n\\n\"Secret documents . . . and very important ones, no doubt?\"\\n\\n\"Of the highest importance. The publication of those papers would lead\\nto results which it would be impossible to foresee, not only from the\\npoint of view of home politics, but also from that of Germany\\'s\\nrelations with the foreign powers.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Lupin, throbbing with emotion. \"Oh, can it be possible? What\\nproof have you?\"\\n\\n\"What proof? The evidence of the grand-duke\\'s wife, the confidences\\nwhich she made to the servant after her husband\\'s death.\"\\n\\n\"Yes . . . yes . . .\" stammered Lupin. \"We have the evidence of the\\ngrand-duke himself.\"\\n\\n\"Better still,\" said Steinweg.\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"A document, a document written in his own hand, signed by him and\\ncontaining . . .\"\\n\\n\"Containing what?\"\\n\\n\"A list of the secret papers confided to his charge.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me, in two words. . . .\"\\n\\n\"In two words? That can\\'t be done. The document is a very long one,\\nscattered all over with annotations and remarks which are sometimes\\nimpossible to understand. Let me mention just two titles which obviously\\nrefer to two bundles of secret papers: _Original letters of the Crown\\nPrince to Bismarck_ is one. The dates show that these letters were\\nwritten during the three months of the reign of Frederick III. To\\npicture what the letters may contain, you have only to think of the\\nEmperor Frederick\\'s illness, his quarrels with his son . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I know. . . . And the other title?\"\\n\\n\"_Photographs of the letters of Frederick III., and the Empress Victoria\\nto the Queen of England._\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean to say that that\\'s there?\" asked Lupin, in a choking voice.\\n\\n\"Listen to the grand-duke\\'s notes: _Text of the treaty with Great\\nBritain and France._ And these rather obscure words: \\'Alsace-Lorraine.\\n. . . Colonies. . . . Limitation of naval armaments. . . .\"\\n\\n\"It says that?\" blurted Lupin. \"And you call that obscure? . . . Why,\\nthe words are dazzling with light! . . . Oh, can it be possible? . . .\\nAnd what next, what next?\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a noise at the door. Some one was knocking.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t come in,\" said Lupin. \"I am busy. . . . Go on, Steinweg.\"\\n\\n\"But . . .\" said the old man, in a great state of alarm.\\n\\nThe door was shaken violently and Lupin recognized Weber\\'s voice. He\\nshouted:\\n\\n\"A little patience, Weber. I shall have done in five minutes.\"\\n\\nHe gripped the old man\\'s arm and, in a tone of command:\\n\\n\"Be easy and go on with your story. So, according to you, the expedition\\nof the grand duke and his servant to Veldenz Castle had no other object\\nthan to hide those papers?\"\\n\\n\"There can be no question about that.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. But the grand-duke may have taken them away since.\"\\n\\n\"No, he did not leave Dresden until his death.\"\\n\\n\"But the grand-duke\\'s enemies, the men who had everything to gain by\\nrecovering them and destroying them: can\\'t they have tried to find out\\nwhere the papers were?\"\\n\\n\"They have tried.\"\\n\\n\"How do you know?\"\\n\\n\"You can understand that I did not remain inactive and that my first\\ncare, after receiving those revelations, was to go to Veldenz and make\\ninquiries for myself in the neighboring villages. Well, I learnt that,\\non two separate occasions, the castle was invaded by a dozen men, who\\ncame from Berlin furnished with credentials to the regents.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"Well, they found nothing, for, since that time, the castle has been\\nfound closed to the public.\"\\n\\n\"But what prevents anybody from getting in?\"\\n\\n\"A garrison of fifty soldiers, who keep watch day and night.\"\\n\\n\"Soldiers of the grand-duchy?\"\\n\\n\"No, soldiers drafted from the Emperor\\'s own body-guard.\"\\n\\nThe din in the passage increased:\\n\\n\"Open the door!\" a voice cried. \"I order you to open the door!\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t. Weber, old chap; the lock has stuck. If you take my advice,\\nyou had better cut the door all round the lock.\"\\n\\n\"Open the door!\"\\n\\n\"And what about the fate of Europe, which we are discussing?\"\\n\\nHe turned to the old man:\\n\\n\"So you were not able to enter the castle?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"But you are persuaded that the papers in question are hidden there?\"\\n\\n\"Look here, haven\\'t I given you proofs enough? Aren\\'t you convinced?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" muttered Lupin, \"that\\'s where they are hidden . . . there\\'s\\nno doubt about it . . . that\\'s where they are hidden. . . .\"\\n\\nHe seemed to see the castle. He seemed to conjure up the mysterious\\nhiding-place. And the vision of an inexhaustible treasure, the dream of\\nchests filled with riches and precious stones could not have excited him\\nmore than the idea of those few scraps of paper watched over by the\\nKaiser\\'s guards. What a wonderful conquest to embark upon! And how\\nworthy of his powers! And what a proof of perspicacity and intuition he\\nhad once more given by throwing himself at a venture upon that unknown\\ntrack!\\n\\nOutside, the men were \"working\" at the lock.\\n\\nLupin asked of old Steinweg:\\n\\n\"What did the grand-duke die of?\"\\n\\n\"An attack of pleurisy, which carried him off in a few days. He hardly\\nrecovered consciousness before the end; and the horrible thing appears\\nto have been that he was seen to make violent efforts, between his fits\\nof delirium, to collect his thoughts and utter connected words. From\\ntime to time, he called his wife, looked at her in a desperate way and\\nvainly moved his lips.\"\\n\\n\"In a word, he spoke?\" said Lupin, cutting him short, for the \"working\"\\nat the lock was beginning to make him anxious.\\n\\n\"No, he did not speak. But, in a comparatively lucid moment, he summoned\\nup the energy to make some marks on a piece of paper which his wife\\ngave him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, those marks . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"They were illegible, for the most part.\"\\n\\n\"For the most part? But the others?\" asked Lupin, greedily. \"The\\nothers?\"\\n\\n\"There were, first, three perfectly distinct figures: an 8, a 1, and a\\n3. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, 813, I know . . . and next?\"\\n\\n\"And next, there were some letters . . . several letters, of which all\\nthat can be made out for certain are a group of three followed,\\nimmediately after, by a group of two letters.\"\\n\\n\"\\'APO ON,\\' is that it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, so you know! . . .\"\\n\\nThe lock was yielding; almost all the screws had been taken out. Lupin,\\nsuddenly alarmed at the thought of being interrupted, asked:\\n\\n\"So that this incomplete word \\'APO ON\\' and the number 813 are the\\nformulas which the grand-duke bequeathed to his wife and son to enable\\nthem to find the secret papers?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"What became of the grand-duke\\'s wife?\"\\n\\n\"She died soon after her husband, of grief, one might say.\"\\n\\n\"And was the child looked after by the family?\"\\n\\n\"What family? The grand-duke had no brothers or sisters. Moreover, he\\nwas only morganatically and secretly married. No, the child was taken\\naway by Hermann\\'s old man-servant, who brought him up under the name of\\nPierre Leduc. He was a bad type of boy, self-willed, capricious and\\ntroublesome. One day, he went off and was never seen again.\"\\n\\n\"Did he know the secret of his birth?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and he was shown the sheet of paper on which Hermann III. had\\nwritten the letters and figures.\"\\n\\n\"And after that this revelation was made to no one but yourself?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\"And you confided only in Mr. Kesselbach?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. But, out of prudence, while showing him the sheet of letters and\\nfigures and the list of which I spoke to you, I kept both those\\ndocuments in my own possession. Events have proved that I was right.\"\\n\\nLupin was now clinging to the door with both hands:\\n\\n\"Weber,\" he roared, \"you\\'re very indiscreet! I shall report you! . . .\\nSteinweg, have you those documents?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Are they in a safe place?\"\\n\\n\"Absolutely.\"\\n\\n\"In Paris?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better. Don\\'t forget that your life is in danger and that\\nyou have people after you.\"\\n\\n\"I know. The least false step and I am done for.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. So take your precautions, throw the enemy off the scent, go\\nand fetch your papers and await my instructions. The thing is cut and\\ndried. In a month, at latest, we will go to Veldenz Castle together.\"\\n\\n\"Suppose I\\'m in prison?\"\\n\\n\"I will take you out.\"\\n\\n\"Can you?\"\\n\\n\"The very day after I come out myself. No, I\\'m wrong: the same evening\\n. . . an hour later.\"\\n\\n\"You have the means?\"\\n\\n\"Since the last ten minutes, an infallible means. You have nothing more\\nto say to me?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll open the door.\"\\n\\nHe pulled back the door, and bowing to M. Weber:\\n\\n\"My poor old Weber, I don\\'t know what excuse to make . . .\"\\n\\nHe did not finish his sentence. The sudden inrush of the deputy-chief\\nand three policeman left him no time.\\n\\nM. Weber was white with rage and indignation. The sight of the two men\\nlying outstretched quite unsettled him.\\n\\n\"Dead!\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\"Not a bit of it, not a bit of it,\" chuckled Lupin, \"only asleep!\\nFormerie was tired out . . . so I allowed him a few moments\\' rest.\"\\n\\n\"Enough of this humbug!\" shouted M. Weber. And, turning to the\\npolicemen, \"Take him back to the Santé. And keep your eyes open, damn\\nit! As for this visitor . . .\"\\n\\nLupin learnt nothing more as to Weber\\'s intentions with regard to old\\nSteinweg. A crowd of municipal guards and police constables hustled him\\ndown to the prison-van.\\n\\nOn the stairs Doudeville whispered:\\n\\n\"Weber had a line to warn him. It told him to mind the confrontation and\\nto be on his guard with Steinweg. The note was signed \\'L. M.\\'\"\\n\\nBut Lupin hardly bothered his head about all this. What did he care for\\nthe murderer\\'s hatred or old Steinweg\\'s fate? He possessed Rudolf\\nKesselbach\\'s secret!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nLUPIN\\'S GREAT SCHEME\\n\\n\\nContrary to his expectations, Lupin had no sort of annoyance to undergo\\nin consequence of his assault on M. Formerie.\\n\\nThe examining-magistrate came to the Santé in person, two days later,\\nand told him, with some embarrassment and with an affectation of\\nkindness, that he did not intend to pursue the matter further.\\n\\n\"Nor I, either,\" retorted Lupin.\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I mean that I shall send no communication to the press about this\\nparticular matter nor do anything that might expose you to ridicule,\\nMonsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction. The scandal shall not be made public, I\\npromise. That is what you want, is it not?\"\\n\\nM. Formerie blushed and, without replying, continued:\\n\\n\"Only, henceforth, your examinations will take place here.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite right that the law should put itself out for Lupin!\" said\\nthat gentleman.\\n\\nThe announcement of this decision, which interrupted his almost daily\\nmeetings with the Doudevilles, did not disturb Lupin. He had taken his\\nprecautions from the first day, by giving the Doudevilles all the\\nnecessary instructions and, now that the preparations were nearly\\ncompleted, reckoned upon being able to turn old Steinweg\\'s confidences\\nto the best account without delay and to obtain his liberty by one of\\nthe most extraordinary and ingenious schemes that had ever entered his\\nbrain.\\n\\nHis method of correspondence was a simple one; and he had devised it at\\nonce. Every morning he was supplied with sheets of paper in numbered\\npackets. He made these into envelopes; and, every evening, the\\nenvelopes, duly folded and gummed, were fetched away. Now Lupin,\\nnoticing that his packet always bore the same number, had drawn the\\ninference that the distribution of the numbered packets was always\\naffected in the same order among the prisoners who had chosen that\\nparticular kind of work. Experience showed that he was right.\\n\\nIt only remained for the Doudevilles to bribe one of the employees of\\nthe private firm entrusted with the supply and dispatch of the\\nenvelopes. This was easily done; and, thenceforward, Lupin, sure of\\nsuccess, had only to wait quietly until the sign agreed upon between him\\nand his friends appeared upon the top sheet of the packet.\\n\\nOn the sixth day, he gave an exclamation of delight:\\n\\n\"At last!\" he said.\\n\\nHe took a tiny bottle from a hiding-place, uncorked it, moistened the\\ntip of his forefinger with the liquid which it contained and passed his\\nfinger over the third sheet in the packet.\\n\\nIn a moment, strokes appeared, then letters, then words and sentences.\\n\\nHe read:\\n\\n      \"All well. Steinweg free. Hiding in country. Geneviève\\n      Ernemont good health. Often goes Hôtel Bristol to see\\n      Mrs. Kesselbach, who is ill. Meets Pierre Leduc there\\n      every time. Answer by same means. No danger.\"\\n\\nSo communications were established with the outside. Once more, Lupin\\'s\\nefforts were crowned with success. All that he had to do now was to\\nexecute his plan and lead the press campaign which he had prepared in\\nthe peaceful solitude of his prison.\\n\\nThree days later, these few lines appeared in the _Grand Journal_:\\n\\n      \"Quite apart from Prince Bismarck\\'s _Memoirs_, which,\\n      according to well-informed people, contain merely the\\n      official history of the events in which the great\\n      chancellor was concerned, there exists a series of\\n      confidential letters of no little interest.\\n\\n      \"These letters have been recently discovered. We hear,\\n      on good authority, that they will be published almost\\n      immediately.\"\\n\\nMy readers will remember the noise which these mysterious sentences made\\nthroughout the civilized world, the comments in which people indulged,\\nthe suggestions put forward and, in particular, the controversy that\\nfollowed in the German press. Who had inspired those lines? What were\\nthe letters in question? Who had written them to the chancellor or who\\nhad received them from him? Was it an act of posthumous revenge? Or was\\nit an indiscretion committed by one of Bismarck\\'s correspondents?\\n\\nA second note settled public opinion as to certain points, but, at the\\nsame time, worked it up to a strange pitch of excitement. It ran as\\nfollows:\\n\\n      \"_To the Editor of the Grand Journal_,\\n                                  \"SANTÉ PALACE,\\n                           \"Cell 14, Second Division.\\n\\n      \"SIR,\\n\\n      \"You inserted in your issue of Tuesday last a\\n      paragraph based upon a few words which I let fall, the\\n      other evening, in the course of a lecture, which I was\\n      delivering at the Santé on foreign politics. Your\\n      correspondent\\'s paragraph, although accurate in all\\n      essential particulars, requires a slight correction.\\n      The letters exist, as stated, and it is impossible to\\n      deny their exceptional importance, seeing that, for\\n      ten years, they have been the object of an\\n      uninterrupted search on the part of the government\\n      interested. But nobody knows where they are hidden and\\n      nobody knows a single word of what they contain.\\n\\n      \"The public, I am convinced, will bear me no ill-will\\n      if I keep it waiting for some time before satisfying\\n      its legitimate curiosity. Apart from the fact that I\\n      am not in possession of all the elements necessary for\\n      the pursuit of the truth, my present occupation does\\n      not allow me to devote so much time as I could wish to\\n      this matter.\\n\\n      \"All that I can say for the moment is that the letters\\n      were entrusted by the dying statesman to one of his\\n      most faithful friends and that this friend had\\n      eventually to suffer the serious consequences of his\\n      loyalty. Constant spying, domiciliary visits, nothing\\n      was spared him.\\n\\n      \"I have given orders to two of the best agents of my\\n      secret police to take up this scent from the start in\\n      a position to get to the bottom of this exciting\\n      mystery.\\n\\n            \"I have the honor to be Sir,\\n                     \"Your obedient servant,\\n                                   \"ARSÈNE LUPIN.\"\\n\\nSo it was Arsène Lupin who was conducting the case! It was he who, from\\nhis prison cell, was stage-managing the comedy or the tragedy announced\\nin the first note. What luck! Everybody was delighted. With an artist\\nlike Lupin, the spectacle could not fail to be both picturesque and\\nstartling.\\n\\nThree days later the _Grand Journal_ contained the following letter from\\nArsène Lupin:\\n\\n      \"The name of the devoted friend to whom I referred has\\n      been imparted to me. It was the Grand-Duke Hermann\\n      III., reigning (although dispossessed) sovereign of\\n      the Grand-duchy of Zweibrucken-Veldenz and a confidant\\n      of Prince Bismarck, whose entire friendship he\\n      enjoyed.\\n\\n      \"A thorough search was made of his house by Count von\\n      W----, at the head of twelve men. The result of this\\n      search was purely negative, but the grand-duke was\\n      nevertheless proved to be in possession of the papers.\\n\\n      \"Where had he hidden them? This was a problem which\\n      probably nobody in the world would be able to solve at\\n      the present moment.\\n\\n      \"I must ask for twenty-four hours in which to solve\\n      it.\\n\\n                                   \"ARSÈNE LUPIN.\"\\n\\nAnd, twenty-four hours later, the promised note appeared:\\n\\n      \"The famous letters are hidden in the feudal castle of\\n      Veldenz, the capital of the Grand-duchy of\\n      Zweibrucken. The castle was partly destroyed in the\\n      course of the nineteenth century.\\n\\n      \"Where exactly are they hidden? And what are the\\n      letters precisely? These are the two problems which I\\n      am now engaged in unravelling; and I shall publish the\\n      solution in four days\\' time.\\n\\n                                   \"ARSÈNE LUPIN.\"\\n\\nOn the day stated, men scrambled to obtain copies of the _Grand\\nJournal_. To the general disappointment, the promised information was\\nnot given. The same silence followed on the next day and the day after.\\n\\nWhat had happened?\\n\\nIt leaked out through an indiscretion at the Prefecture of Police. The\\ngovernor of the Santé, it appeared, had been warned that Lupin was\\ncommunicating with his accomplices by means of the packets of envelopes\\nwhich he made. Nothing had been discovered; but it was thought best, in\\nany case, to forbid all work to the insufferable prisoner.\\n\\nTo this the insufferable prisoner replied:\\n\\n\"As I have nothing to do now, I may as well attend to my trial. Please\\nlet my counsel, Maître Quimbel, know.\"\\n\\nIt was true. Lupin, who, hitherto, had refused to hold any intercourse\\nwith Maître Quimbel, now consented to see him and to prepare his\\ndefence.\\n\\nOn the next day Maître Quimbel, in cheery tones, asked for Lupin to be\\nbrought to the barristers\\' room. He was an elderly man, wearing a pair\\nof very powerful spectacles, which made his eyes seem enormous. He put\\nhis hat on the table, spread out his brief-case and at once began to put\\na series of questions which he had carefully prepared.\\n\\nLupin replied with extreme readiness and even volunteered a host of\\nparticulars, which Maître Quimbel took down, as he spoke, on slips\\npinned one to the other.\\n\\n\"And so you say,\" continued the barrister, with his head over his\\npapers, \"that, at that time . . .\"\\n\\n\"I say that, at that time . . .\" Lupin answered.\\n\\nLittle by little, with a series of natural and hardly perceptible\\nmovements, he leant elbows on the table. He gradually lowered his arms,\\nslipped his hand under Maître Quimbel\\'s hat, put his finger into the\\nleather band and took out one of those strips of paper, folded\\nlengthwise, which the hatter inserts between the leather and the lining\\nwhen the hat is a trifle too large.\\n\\nHe unfolded the paper. It was a message from Doudeville, written in a\\ncipher agreed upon beforehand:\\n\\n      \"I am engaged as indoor servant at Maître Quimbel\\'s.\\n      You can answer by the same means without fear.\\n\\n      \"It was L. M., the murderer, who gave away the\\n      envelope trick. A good thing that you foresaw this\\n      move!\"\\n\\nHereupon followed a minute report of all the facts and comments caused\\nby Lupin\\'s revelations.\\n\\nLupin took from his pocket a similar strip of paper containing his\\ninstructions, quietly substituted it in the place of the other and drew\\nhis hand back again. The trick was played.\\n\\nAnd Lupin\\'s correspondence with the _Grand Journal_ was resumed without\\nfurther delay.\\n\\n      \"I apologize to the public for not keeping my promise.\\n      The postal arrangements at the Santé Palace are\\n      woefully inadequate.\\n\\n      \"However, we are near the end. I have in hand all the\\n      documents that establish the truth upon an\\n      indisputable basis. I shall not publish them for the\\n      moment. Nevertheless, I will say this: among the\\n      letters are some that were addressed to the chancellor\\n      by one who, at that time, declared himself his\\n      disciple and his admirer and who was destined, several\\n      years after, to rid himself of that irksome tutor and\\n      to govern alone.\\n\\n      \"I trust that I make myself sufficiently clear.\"\\n\\nAnd, on the next day:\\n\\n      \"The letters were written during the late Emperor\\'s\\n      illness. I need hardly add more to prove their\\n      importance.\"\\n\\nFour days of silence, and then this final note, which caused a stir that\\nhas not yet been forgotten:\\n\\n      \"My investigation is finished. I now know everything.\\n\\n      \"By dint of reflection, I have guessed the secret of\\n      the hiding-place.\\n\\n      \"My friends are going to Veldenz and, in spite of\\n      every obstacle, will enter the castle by a way which I\\n      am pointing out to them.\\n\\n      \"The newspapers will then publish photographs of the\\n      letters, of which I already know the tenor; but I\\n      prefer to reproduce the whole text.\\n\\n      \"This certain, inevitable publication will take place\\n      in a fortnight from to-day precisely, on the 22nd of\\n      August next.\\n\\n      \"Between this and then I will keep silence . . . and\\n      wait.\"\\n\\nThe communications to the _Grand Journal_ did, in fact, stop for a time,\\nbut Lupin never ceased corresponding with his friends, \"_via_ the hat,\"\\nas they said among themselves. It was so simple! There was no danger.\\nWho could ever suspect that Maître Quimbel\\'s hat served Lupin as a\\nletter-box?\\n\\nEvery two or three mornings, whenever he called, in fact, the celebrated\\nadvocate faithfully brought his client\\'s letters: letters from Paris,\\nletters from the country, letters from Germany; all reduced and\\ncondensed by Doudeville into a brief form and cipher language. And, an\\nhour later, Maître Quimbel solemnly walked away, carrying Lupin\\'s\\norders.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nNow, one day, the governor of the Santé received a telephone message,\\nsigned, \"L. M.,\" informing him that Maître Quimbel was, in all\\nprobability, serving Lupin as his unwitting postman and that it would be\\nadvisable to keep an eye upon the worthy man\\'s visits. The governor told\\nMaître Quimbel, who thereupon resolved to bring his junior with him.\\n\\nSo, once again, in spite of all Lupin\\'s efforts, in spite of his fertile\\npowers of invention, in spite of the marvels of ingenuity which he\\nrenewed after each defeat, once again Lupin found himself cut off from\\ncommunication with the outside world by the infernal genius of his\\nformidable adversary. And he found himself thus cut off at the most\\ncritical moment, at the solemn minute when, from his cell, he was\\nplaying his last trump-card against the coalesced forces that were\\noverwhelming him so terribly.\\n\\n             *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOn the 13th of August, as he sat facing the two counsels, his attention\\nwas attracted by a newspaper in which some of Maître Quimbel\\'s papers\\nwere wrapped up.\\n\\nHe saw a heading in very large type\\n\\n                            \"813\"\\n\\nThe sub-headings were:\\n\\n                       \"A FRESH MURDER\\n\\n                  \"THE EXCITEMENT IN GERMANY\\n\\n       \"HAS THE SECRET OF THE \\'APOON\\' BEEN DISCOVERED?\"\\n\\nLupin turned pale with anguish. Below he read the words:\\n\\n      \"Two sensational telegrams reach us at the moment of\\n      going to press.\\n\\n      \"The body of an old man has been found near Augsburg,\\n      with his throat cut with a knife. The police have\\n      succeeded in identifying the victim: it is Steinweg,\\n      the man mentioned in the Kesselbach case.\\n\\n      \"On the other hand, a correspondent telegraphs that\\n      the famous English detective, Holmlock Shears, has\\n      been hurriedly summoned to Cologne. He will there meet\\n      the Emperor; and they will both proceed to Veldenz\\n      Castle.\\n\\n      \"Holmlock Shears is said to have undertaken to\\n      discover the secret of the \\'APOON.\\'\\n\\n      \"If he succeeds, it will mean the pitiful failure of\\n      the incomprehensible campaign which Arsène Lupin has\\n      been conducting for the past month in so strange a\\n      fashion.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nPerhaps public curiosity was never so much stirred as by the duel\\nannounced to take place between Shears and Lupin, an invisible duel in\\nthe circumstances, an anonymous duel, one might say, in which everything\\nwould happen in the dark, in which people would be able to judge only by\\nthe final results, and yet an impressive duel, because of all the\\nscandal that circled around the adventure and because of the stakes in\\ndispute between the two irreconcilable enemies, now once more opposed to\\neach other.\\n\\nAnd it was a question not of small private interests, of insignificant\\nburglaries, of trumpery individual passions, but of a matter of really\\nworld-wide importance, involving the politics of the three great western\\nnations and capable of disturbing the peace of the world.\\n\\nPeople waited anxiously; and no one knew exactly what he was waiting\\nfor. For, after all, if the detective came out victorious in the duel,\\nif he found the letters, who would ever know? What proof would any one\\nhave of his triumph?\\n\\nIn the main, all hopes were centred on Lupin, on his well-known habit\\nof calling the public to witness his acts. What was he going to do? How\\ncould he avert the frightful danger that threatened him? Was he even\\naware of it?\\n\\nThose were the questions which men asked themselves.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nBetween the four walls of his cell, prisoner 14 asked himself pretty\\nnearly the same questions; and he for his part, was not stimulated by\\nidle curiosity, but by real uneasiness, by constant anxiety. He felt\\nhimself irrevocably alone, with impotent hands, an impotent will, an\\nimpotent brain. It availed him nothing that he was able, ingenious,\\nfearless, heroic. The struggle was being carried on without him. His\\npart was now finished. He had joined all the pieces and set all the\\nsprings of the great machine that was to produce, that was, in a manner\\nof speaking, automatically to manufacture his liberty; and it was\\nimpossible for him to make a single movement to improve and supervise\\nhis handiwork.\\n\\nAt the date fixed, the machine would start working. Between now and\\nthen, a thousand adverse incidents might spring up, a thousand obstacles\\narise, without his having the means to combat those incidents or remove\\nthose obstacles.\\n\\nLupin spent the unhappiest hours of his life at that time. He doubted\\nhimself. He wondered whether his existence would be buried for good in\\nthe horror of a jail. Had he not made a mistake in his calculations? Was\\nit not childish to believe that the event that was to set him free would\\nhappen on the appointed date?\\n\\n\"Madness!\" he cried. \"My argument is false. . . . How can I expect such\\na concurrence of circumstances? There will be some little fact that\\nwill destroy all . . . the inevitable grain of sand. . . .\"\\n\\nSteinweg\\'s death and the disappearance of the documents which the old\\nman was to make over to him did not trouble him greatly. The documents\\nhe could have done without in case of need; and, with the few words\\nwhich Steinweg had told him, he was able, by dint of guess-work and his\\nnative genius, to reconstruct what the Emperor\\'s letters contained and\\nto draw up the plan of battle that would lead to victory. But he thought\\nof Holmlock Shears, who was over there now, in the very centre of the\\nbattlefield, and who was seeking and who would find the letters, thus\\ndemolishing the edifice so patiently built up.\\n\\nAnd he thought of \"the other one,\" the implacable enemy, lurking round\\nthe prison, hidden in the prison, perhaps, who guessed his most secret\\nplans even before they were hatched in the mystery of his thought.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe 17th of August! . . . The 18th of August! . . . The 19th! . . . Two\\nmore days. . . . Two centuries rather! Oh, the interminable minutes!\\n. . .\\n\\nLupin, usually so calm, so entirely master of himself, so ingenious at\\nproviding matter for his own amusement, was feverish, exultant and\\ndepressed by turns, powerless against the enemy, mistrusting everything\\nand everybody, morose.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe 20th of August! . . . .\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nHe would have wished to act and he could not. Whatever he did, it was\\nimpossible for him to hasten the hour of the catastrophe. This\\ncatastrophe would take place or would not take place; but Lupin would\\nnot know for certain until the last hour of the last day was spent to\\nthe last minute. Then--and then alone--he would know of the definite\\nfailure of his scheme.\\n\\n\"The inevitable failure,\" he kept on repeating to himself. \"Success\\ndepends upon circumstances far too subtle and can be obtained only by\\nmethods far too psychological. . . . There is no doubt that I am\\ndeceiving myself as to the value and the range of my weapons. . . . And\\nyet . . .\"\\n\\nHope returned to him. He weighed his chances. They suddenly seemed to\\nhim real and formidable. The fact was going to happen as he had foreseen\\nit happening and for the very reasons which he had expected. It was\\ninevitable. . . .\\n\\nYes, inevitable. Unless, indeed, Shears discovered the hiding-place.\\n. . .\\n\\nAnd again he thought of Shears; and again an immense sense of\\ndiscouragement overwhelmed him.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe last day. . . .\\n\\nHe woke late, after a night of bad dreams.\\n\\nHe saw nobody that day, neither the examining magistrate nor his\\ncounsel.\\n\\nThe afternoon dragged along slowly and dismally, and the evening came,\\nthe murky evening of the cells. . . . He was in a fever. His heart beat\\nin his chest like the clapper of a bell.\\n\\nAnd the minutes passed, irretrievably. . . .\\n\\nAt nine o\\'clock, nothing. At ten o\\'clock, nothing.\\n\\nWith all his nerves tense as the string of a bow, he listened to the\\nvague prison sounds, tried to catch through those inexorable walls all\\nthat might trickle in from the life outside.\\n\\nOh, how he would have liked to stay the march of time and to give\\ndestiny a little more leisure!\\n\\nBut what was the good? Was everything not finished? . . .\\n\\n\"Oh,\" he cried, \"I am going mad! If all this were only over . . . that\\nwould be better. I can begin again, differently. . . . I shall try\\nsomething else . . . but I can\\'t go on like this, I can\\'t go on. . . .\"\\n\\nHe held his head in his hands, pressing it with all his might, locking\\nhimself within himself and concentrating his whole mind upon one\\nsubject, as though he wished to provoke, as though he wished to create\\nthe formidable, stupefying, inadmissible event to which he had attached\\nhis independence and his fortune:\\n\\n\"It must happen,\" he muttered, \"it must; and it must, not because I wish\\nit, but because it is logical. And it shall happen . . . it shall\\nhappen. . . .\"\\n\\nHe beat his skull with his fists; and delirious words rose to his lips.\\n. . .\\n\\nThe key grated in the lock. In his frenzy, he had not heard the sound of\\nfootsteps in the corridor; and now, suddenly, a ray of light penetrated\\ninto his cell and the door opened.\\n\\nThree men entered.\\n\\nLupin had not a moment of surprise.\\n\\nThe unheard-of miracle was being worked; and this at once seemed to him\\nnatural and normal, in perfect agreement with truth and justice.\\n\\nBut a rush of pride flooded his whole being. At this minute he really\\nreceived a clear sensation of his own strength and intelligence. . . .\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Shall I switch on the light?\" asked one of the three men, in whom\\nLupin recognized the governor of the prison.\\n\\n\"No,\" replied the taller of his companions, speaking in a foreign\\naccent. \"This lantern will do.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I go?\"\\n\\n\"Act according to your duty, sir,\" said the same individual.\\n\\n\"My instructions from the prefect of police are to comply entirely with\\nyour wishes.\"\\n\\n\"In that case, sir, it would be preferable that you should withdraw.\"\\n\\nM. Borély went away, leaving the door half open, and remained outside,\\nwithin call.\\n\\nThe visitor exchanged a few words with the one who had not yet spoken;\\nand Lupin vainly tried to distinguish his features in the shade. He saw\\nonly two dark forms, clad in wide motoring-cloaks and wearing caps with\\nthe flaps lowered.\\n\\n\"Are you Arsène Lupin?\" asked the man, turning the light of the lantern\\nfull on his face.\\n\\nHe smiled:\\n\\n\"Yes, I am the person known as Arsène Lupin, at present a prisoner in\\nthe Santé, cell 14, second division.\"\\n\\n\"Was it you,\" continued the visitor, \"who published in the _Grand\\nJournal_ a series of more or less fanciful notes, in which there is a\\nquestion of a so-called collection of letters . . . ?\"\\n\\nLupin interrupted him.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, but, before pursuing this conversation, the\\nobject of which, between ourselves, is none too clear to me, I should be\\nmuch obliged if you would tell me to whom I have the honour of\\nspeaking.\"\\n\\n\"Absolutely unnecessary,\" replied the stranger.\\n\\n\"Absolutely essential,\" declared Lupin.\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"For reasons of politeness, sir. You know my name and I do not know\\nyours; this implies a disregard of good form which I cannot suffer.\"\\n\\nThe stranger lost patience:\\n\\n\"The mere fact that the governor of the prison brought us here shows\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"That M. Borély does not know his manners,\" said Lupin. \"M. Borély\\nshould have introduced us to each other. We are equals here, sir: it is\\nno case of a superior and an inferior, of a prisoner and a visitor who\\ncondescends to come and see him. There are two men here; and one of\\nthose two men has a hat on his head, which he ought not to have.\"\\n\\n\"Now look here . . .\"\\n\\n\"Take the lesson as you please, sir,\" said Lupin.\\n\\nThe stranger came closer to him and tried to speak.\\n\\n\"The hat first,\" said Lupin, \"the hat. . . .\"\\n\\n\"You shall listen to me!\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\nMatters were becoming virulent, stupidly. The second stranger, the one\\nwho had kept silent, placed his hand on his companion\\'s shoulder and\\nsaid, in German:\\n\\n\"Leave him to me.\"\\n\\n\"Why, it was understood . . .\"\\n\\n\"Hush . . . and go away!\"\\n\\n\"Leaving you alone?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But the door?\"\\n\\n\"Shut it and walk away.\"\\n\\n\"But this man . . . you know who he is. . . . Arsène Lupin. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Go away!\"\\n\\nThe other went out, cursing under his breath.\\n\\n\"Pull the door!\" cried the second visitor. \"Harder than that. . . .\\nAltogether! . . . That\\'s right. . . .\"\\n\\nThen he turned, took the lantern and raised it slowly:\\n\\n\"Shall I tell you who I am?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Lupin.\\n\\n\"And why?\"\\n\\n\"Because I know.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\"\\n\\n\"You are the visitor I was expecting.\"\\n\\n\"I?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nCHARLEMAGNE\\n\\n\\n\"Silence!\" said the stranger, sharply. \"Don\\'t use that word.\"\\n\\n\"Then what shall I call Your . . .\"\\n\\n\"Call me nothing.\"\\n\\nThey were both silent; and this moment of respite was not one of those\\nwhich go before the struggle of two adversaries ready for the fray. The\\nstranger strode to and fro with the air of a master accustomed to\\ncommand and to be obeyed. Lupin stood motionless. He had abandoned his\\nusual provocative attitude and his sarcastic smile. He waited, gravely\\nand deferentially. But, down in the depths of his being, he revelled,\\neagerly, madly, in the marvellous situation in which he found himself\\nplaced: here, in his cell, he, a prisoner; he, the adventurer; he, the\\nswindler, the burglar; he, Arsène Lupin . . . face to face with that\\ndemi-god of the modern world, that formidable entity, the heir of Cæsar\\nand of Charlemagne.\\n\\nHe was intoxicated for a moment with the sense of his own power. The\\ntears came to his eyes when he thought of his triumph. . . .\\n\\nThe stranger stood still.\\n\\nAnd at once, with the very first sentence, they came to the immediate\\npoint:\\n\\n\"To-morrow is the 22nd of August. The letters are to be published\\nto-morrow, are they not?\"\\n\\n\"To-night, in two hours from now, my friends are to hand in to the\\n_Grand Journal_, not the letters themselves, but an exact list of the\\nletters, with the Grand-duke Hermann\\'s annotations.\"\\n\\n\"That list shall not be handed in.\"\\n\\n\"It shall not be.\"\\n\\n\"You will give it to me.\"\\n\\n\"It shall be placed in the hands of Your . . . in your hands.\"\\n\\n\"Likewise, all the letters?\"\\n\\n\"Likewise, all the letters.\"\\n\\n\"Without any of them being photographed?\"\\n\\n\"Without any of them being photographed.\"\\n\\nThe stranger spoke in a very calm voice, containing not the least accent\\nof entreaty nor the least inflection of authority. He neither ordered\\nnor requested; he stated the inevitable actions of Arsène Lupin. Things\\nwould happen as he said. And they would happen, whatever Arsène Lupin\\'s\\ndemands should be, at whatever price he might value the performance of\\nthose actions. The conditions were accepted beforehand.\\n\\n\"By Jove,\" said Lupin to himself, \"that\\'s jolly clever of him! If he\\nleaves it to my generosity, I am a ruined man!\"\\n\\nThe very way in which the conversation opened, the frankness of the\\nwords employed, the charm of voice and manner all pleased him\\ninfinitely.\\n\\nHe pulled himself together, lest he should relent and abandon all the\\nadvantages which he had conquered so fiercely.\\n\\nAnd the stranger continued:\\n\\n\"Have you read the letters?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"But some one you know has read them?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"In that case . . .\"\\n\\n\"I have the grand-duke\\'s list and his notes. Moreover, I know the\\nhiding-place where he put all his papers.\"\\n\\n\"Why did you not take them before this?\"\\n\\n\"I did not know the secret of the hiding-place until I came here. My\\nfriends are on the way there now.\"\\n\\n\"The castle is guarded. It is occupied by two hundred of my most trusty\\nmen.\"\\n\\n\"Ten thousand would not be sufficient.\"\\n\\nAfter a minute\\'s reflection, the visitor asked:\\n\\n\"How do you know the secret?\"\\n\\n\"I guessed it.\"\\n\\n\"But you had other elements of information which the papers did not\\npublish?\"\\n\\n\"No, none at all.\"\\n\\n\"And yet I had the castle searched for four days.\"\\n\\n\"Holmlock Shears looked in the wrong place.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said the stranger to himself. \"It\\'s an odd thing, an odd thing!\\n. . .\" And, to Lupin, \"You are sure that your supposition is correct?\"\\n\\n\"It is not a supposition: it is a certainty.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better,\" muttered the visitor. \"There will be no rest until\\nthose papers cease to exist.\"\\n\\nAnd, placing himself in front of Arsène Lupin:\\n\\n\"How much?\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Lupin, taken aback.\\n\\n\"How much for the papers? How much do you ask to reveal the secret?\"\\n\\nHe waited for Lupin to name a figure. He suggested one himself:\\n\\n\"Fifty thousand? . . . A hundred thousand?\"\\n\\nAnd, when Lupin did not reply, he said, with a little hesitation:\\n\\n\"More? Two hundred thousand? Very well! I agree.\"\\n\\nLupin smiled and, in a low voice, said:\\n\\n\"It is a handsome figure. But is it not likely that some sovereign, let\\nus say, the King of England, would give as much as a million? In all\\nsincerity?\"\\n\\n\"I believe so.\"\\n\\n\"And that those letters are priceless to the Emperor, that they are\\nworth two million quite as easily as two hundred thousand francs . . .\\nthree million as easily as two?\"\\n\\n\"I think so.\"\\n\\n\"And, if necessary, the Emperor would give that three million francs?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Then it will not be difficult to come to an arrangement.\"\\n\\n\"On that basis?\" cried the stranger, not without some alarm.\\n\\nLupin smiled again:\\n\\n\"On that basis, no. . . . I am not looking for money. I want something\\nelse, something that is worth more to me than any number of millions.\"\\n\\n\"What is that?\"\\n\\n\"My liberty.\"\\n\\n\"What! Your liberty. . . . But I can do nothing. . . . That concerns\\nyour country . . . the law. . . . I have no power.\"\\n\\nLupin went up to him and, lowering his voice still more:\\n\\n\"You have every power, Sire. . . . My liberty is not such an exceptional\\nevent that they are likely to refuse you.\"\\n\\n\"Then I should have to ask for it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Of whom?\"\\n\\n\"Of Valenglay, the prime minister.\"\\n\\n\"But M. Valenglay himself can do no more than I.\"\\n\\n\"He can open the doors of this prison for me.\"\\n\\n\"It would cause a public outcry.\"\\n\\n\"When I say, open . . . half-open would be enough . . . We should\\ncounterfeit an escape. . . . The public so thoroughly expects it that it\\nwould not so much as ask for an explanation.\"\\n\\n\"Very well . . . but M. Valenglay will never consent. . . .\"\\n\\n\"He will consent.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because you will express the wish.\"\\n\\n\"My wishes are not commands . . . to him!\"\\n\\n\"No . . . but an opportunity of making himself agreeable to the Emperor\\nby fulfilling them. And Valenglay is too shrewd a politician. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense! Do you imagine that the French government will commit so\\nillegal an act for the sole pleasure of making itself agreeable to me?\"\\n\\n\"That pleasure will not be the sole one.\"\\n\\n\"What will be the other?\"\\n\\n\"The pleasure of serving France by accepting the proposal which will\\naccompany the request for my release.\"\\n\\n\"I am to make a proposal? I?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire.\"\\n\\n\"What proposal?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know, but it seems to me that there is always a favorable\\nground on which to come to an understanding . . . there are\\npossibilities of agreement. . . .\"\\n\\nThe stranger looked at him, without grasping his meaning. Lupin leant\\nforward and, as though seeking his words, as though putting an imaginary\\ncase, said:\\n\\n\"Let me suppose that two great countries are divided by some\\ninsignificant question . . . that they have different points of view on\\na matter of secondary importance . . . a colonial matter, for instance,\\nin which their self-esteem is at stake rather than their interest. . . .\\nIs it inconceivable that the ruler of one of those countries might come\\nof his own accord to treat this matter in a new spirit of conciliation\\n. . . and give the necessary instructions . . . so that . . .\"\\n\\n\"So that I might leave Morocco to France?\" said the stranger, with a\\nburst of laughter.\\n\\nThe idea which Lupin was suggesting struck him as the most comical thing\\nthat he had ever heard; and he laughed heartily. The disparity was so\\ngreat between the object aimed at and the means proposed!\\n\\n\"Of course, of course!\" he resumed, with a vain attempt to recover his\\nseriousness. \"Of course, it\\'s a very original idea: the whole of modern\\npolitics upset so that Arsène Lupin may be free! . . . The plans of the\\nEmpire destroyed so that Arsène Lupin may continue his exploits! . . .\\nWhy not ask me for Alsace and Lorraine at once?\"\\n\\n\"I did think of it, Sire,\" replied Lupin, calmly. The stranger\\'s\\nmerriment increased:\\n\\n\"Splendid! And you let me off?\"\\n\\n\"This time, yes.\"\\n\\nLupin had crossed his arms. He, too, was amusing himself by\\nexaggerating the part which he was playing; and he continued, with\\naffected seriousness:\\n\\n\"A series of circumstances might one day arise which would put in my\\nhands the power of _demanding_ and _obtaining_ that restitution. When\\nthat day comes, I shall certainly not fail to do so. For the moment, the\\nweapons at my disposal oblige me to be more modest. Peace in Morocco\\nwill satisfy me.\"\\n\\n\"Just that?\"\\n\\n\"Just that.\"\\n\\n\"Morocco against your liberty!\"\\n\\n\"Nothing more . . . or, rather--for we must not lose sight entirely of\\nthe main object of this conversation--or, rather, a little good will on\\nthe part of one of the countries in question . . . and, in exchange, the\\nsurrender of the letters which are in my power.\"\\n\\n\"Those letters, those letters!\" muttered the stranger irritably. \"After\\nall, perhaps they are not so valuable. . . .\"\\n\\n\"There are some in your own hand, Sire; and you considered them valuable\\nenough to come to this cell. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Well, what does it matter?\"\\n\\n\"But there are others of which you do not know the authorship and about\\nwhich I can give you a few particulars.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said the stranger, rather anxiously.\\n\\nLupin hesitated.\\n\\n\"Speak, speak plainly,\" said the stranger. \"Say what you have in your\\nmind.\"\\n\\nIn the profound silence of the cell, Lupin declared, with a certain\\nsolemnity:\\n\\n\"Twenty years ago a draft treaty was prepared between Germany, Great\\nBritain, and France.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not true! It\\'s impossible! Who could have done such a thing?\"\\n\\n\"The Emperor\\'s father and the Queen of England, his grandmother, both\\nacting under the influence of the Empress Frederick.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible! I repeat, it is impossible!\"\\n\\n\"The correspondence is in the hiding-place at Veldenz Castle; and I\\nalone know the secret of the hiding-place.\"\\n\\nThe stranger walked up and down with an agitated step. Then he stopped\\nshort:\\n\\n\"Is the text of the treaty included in that correspondence?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire. It is in your father\\'s own hand.\"\\n\\n\"And what does it say?\"\\n\\n\"By that treaty, France and Great Britain granted and promised Germany\\nan immense colonial empire, the empire which she does not at present\\npossess and which has become a necessity to her, in these times, to\\nensure her greatness.\"\\n\\n\"And what did England demand as a set-off against that empire?\"\\n\\n\"The limitation of the German fleet.\"\\n\\n\"And France?\"\\n\\n\"Alsace and Lorraine.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor leant against the table in silent thought. Lupin continued:\\n\\n\"Everything was ready. The cabinets of Paris and London had been sounded\\nand had consented. The thing was practically done. The great treaty of\\nalliance was on the point of being concluded. It would have laid the\\nfoundations of a definite and universal peace. The death of your father\\ndestroyed that sublime dream. But I ask Your Imperial Majesty, what\\nwill your people think, what will the world think, when it knows that\\nFrederick III., one of the heroes of 1870, a German, a pure and loyal\\nGerman, respected by all, generally admired for his nobility of\\ncharacter, agreed to the restitution of Alsace-Lorraine and therefore\\nconsidered that restitution just?\"\\n\\nHe was silent for an instant leaving the problem to fix itself in its\\nprecise terms before the Emperor\\'s conscience, before his conscience as\\na man, a son and a sovereign. Then he concluded:\\n\\n\"Your Imperial Majesty yourself must know whether you wish or do not\\nwish history to record the existence of that treaty. As for me, Sire,\\nyou can see that my humble personality counts for very little in the\\ndiscussion.\"\\n\\nA long pause followed upon Lupin\\'s words. He waited, with his soul torn\\nwith anguish. His whole destiny was at stake, in this minute which he\\nhad conceived and, in a manner, produced with such effort and such\\nstubbornness, an historic minute, born of his brain, in which \"his\\nhumble personality,\" for all that he might say, weighed heavily upon the\\nfate of empires and the peace of the world.\\n\\nOpposite him, in the shadow, Cæsar stood meditating.\\n\\nWhat answer would he make? What solution would he give to the problem?\\n\\nHe walked across the cell for a few moments, which to Lupin seemed\\ninterminable. Then he stopped and asked:\\n\\n\"Are there any other conditions?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire, but they are insignificant.\"\\n\\n\"Name them.\"\\n\\n\"I have found the son of the Grand-duke of Zweibrucken-Veldenz. The\\ngrand-duchy must be restored to him.\"\\n\\n\"Anything else?\"\\n\\n\"He loves a young girl, who loves him in her turn. She is the fairest\\nand the most virtuous of her sex. He must marry her.\"\\n\\n\"Anything else?\"\\n\\n\"That is all.\"\\n\\n\"There is nothing more?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing. Your majesty need only have this letter delivered to the\\neditor of the _Grand Journal_, who will then destroy, unread, the\\narticle which he may now receive at any moment.\"\\n\\nLupin held out the letter, with a heavy heart and a trembling hand. If\\nthe Emperor took it, that would be a sign of his acceptance.\\n\\nThe Emperor hesitated and then, with an abrupt movement, took the\\nletter, put on his hat, wrapped his cloak round him and walked out\\nwithout a word.\\n\\nLupin remained for a few seconds, staggering, as though dazed. . . .\\n\\nThen, suddenly, he fell into his chair, shouting with joy and pride.\\n. . .\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Juge d\\'Instruction, I am sorry to say good-bye to you\\nto-day.\"\\n\\n\"Why, M. Lupin, are you thinking of leaving us?\"\\n\\n\"With the greatest reluctance, I assure you, Monsieur le Juge\\nd\\'Instruction. Our relations have been so very pleasant and cordial! But\\nall good things must come to an end. My cure at the Santé Palace is\\nfinished. Other duties call me. I have resolved to make my escape\\nto-night.\"\\n\\n\"Then I wish you good luck, M. Lupin.\"\\n\\n\"A thousand thanks, M. le Juge d\\'Instruction.\"\\n\\nArsène Lupin waited patiently for the hour of his escape, not without\\nasking himself how it would be contrived and by what means France and\\nGermany, uniting for the joint performance of this deserving work, would\\nsucceed in effecting it without creating too great a scandal.\\n\\nLate in the afternoon, the warder told him to go to the entrance-yard.\\nHe hurried out and was met by the governor, who handed him over to M.\\nWeber. M. Weber made him step into a motor-car in which somebody was\\nalready seated.\\n\\nLupin had a violent fit of laughter:\\n\\n\"What, you, my poor old Weber! Have they let you in for this tiresome\\njob? Are you to be responsible for my escape? Upon my word, you are an\\nunlucky beggar! Oh, my poor old chap, what hard lines! First made famous\\nthrough my arrest, you are now to become immortal through my escape!\"\\n\\nHe looked at the other man:\\n\\n\"Well, well, Monsieur le Préfet de Police, so you are in the business\\ntoo! That\\'s a nasty thing for you, what? If you take my advice, you\\'ll\\nstay in the background and leave the honor and glory to Weber! It\\'s his\\nby right! . . . And he can stand a lot, the rascal!\"\\n\\nThe car travelled at a fast pace, along the Seine and through Boulogne.\\nAt Saint-Cloud, they crossed the river.\\n\\n\"Splendid!\" cried Lupin. \"We\\'re going to Garches! You want me there, in\\norder to reënact the death of Altenheim. We shall go down into the\\nunderground passage, I shall disappear and people will say that I got\\nthrough another outlet, known to myself alone! Lord, how idiotic!\"\\n\\nHe seemed quite unhappy about it:\\n\\n\"Idiotic! Idiotic in the highest degree! I blush for shame! . . . And\\nthose are the people who govern us! . . . What an age to live in! . . .\\nBut, you poor devils, why didn\\'t you come to me? I\\'d have invented a\\nbeautiful little escape for you, something of a miraculous nature. I had\\nit all ready pigeon-holed in my mind! The public would have yelled with\\nwonder and danced with delight. Instead of which . . . However, it\\'s\\nquite true that you were given rather short notice . . . but all the\\nsame . . .\"\\n\\nThe programme was exactly as Lupin had foreseen. They walked through the\\ngrounds of the House of Retreat to the Pavillon Hortense. Lupin and his\\ntwo companions went down the stairs and along the underground passage.\\nAt the end of the tunnel, the deputy-chief said:\\n\\n\"You are free.\"\\n\\n\"And there you are!\" said Lupin. \"Is that all? Well, my dear Weber,\\nthank you very much and sorry to have given you so much trouble.\\nGood-bye, Monsieur le Préfet; kind regards to the missus!\"\\n\\nHe climbed the stairs that led to the Villa des Glycines, raised the\\ntrap-door and sprang into the room.\\n\\nA hand fell on his shoulder.\\n\\nOpposite him stood his first visitor of the day before, the one who had\\naccompanied the Emperor. There were four men with him, two on either\\nside.\\n\\n\"Look here,\" said Lupin, \"what\\'s the meaning of this joke? I thought I\\nwas free!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" growled the German, in his rough voice, \"you are free . . .\\nfree to travel with the five of us . . . if that suits you.\"\\n\\nLupin looked at him, for a second, with a mad longing to hit him on the\\nnose, just to teach him. But the five men looked devilish determined.\\nTheir leader did not betray any exaggerated fondness for him; and it\\nseemed to him that the fellow would be only too pleased to resort to\\nextreme measures. Besides, after all, what did he care?\\n\\nHe chuckled:\\n\\n\"If it suits me? Why, it\\'s the dream of my life!\"\\n\\nA powerful covered car was waiting in the paved yard outside the villa.\\nTwo men got into the driver\\'s seat, two others inside, with their backs\\nto the motor. Lupin and the stranger sat down on the front seat.\\n\\n\"_Vorwarts!_\" cried Lupin, in German. \"_Vorwarts nach Veldenz!_\"\\n\\nThe stranger said:\\n\\n\"Silence! Those men must know nothing. Speak French. They don\\'t know\\nFrench. But why speak at all?\"\\n\\n\"Quite right,\" said Lupin to himself. \"Why speak at all?\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe car travelled all the evening and all night, without any incident.\\nTwice they stopped to take in petrol at some sleepy little town.\\n\\nThe Germans took it in turns to watch their prisoner, who did not open\\nhis eyes until the early morning.\\n\\nThey stopped for breakfast at an inn on a hillside, near which stood a\\nsign-post. Lupin saw that they were at an equal distance from Metz and\\nLuxemburg. From there, they took a road that slanted north-east, in the\\ndirection of Treves.\\n\\nLupin said to his travelling-companion:\\n\\n\"Am I right in believing that I have the honor of speaking to Count von\\nWaldemar, the Emperor\\'s confidential friend, the one who searched\\nHermann III.\\'s house in Dresden?\"\\n\\nThe stranger remained silent.\\n\\n\"You\\'re the sort of chap I can\\'t stand at any price,\" muttered Lupin.\\n\"I\\'ll have some fun with you, one of these days. You\\'re ugly, you\\'re\\nfat, you\\'re heavy; in short, I don\\'t like you.\" And he added, aloud,\\n\"You are wrong not to answer me, Monsieur le Comte. I was speaking in\\nyour own interest: just as we were stepping in, I saw a motor come into\\nsight, behind us, on the horizon. Did you see it?\"\\n\\n\"No, why?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Still. . . .\"\\n\\n\"No, nothing at all . . . a mere remark. . . . Besides, we are ten\\nminutes ahead . . . and our car is at least a forty-horse-power.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a sixty,\" said the German, looking at him uneasily from the corner\\nof his eye.\\n\\n\"Oh, then we\\'re all right!\"\\n\\nThey were climbing a little slope. When they reached the top, the count\\nleant out of the window:\\n\\n\"Damn it all!\" he swore.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Lupin.\\n\\nThe count turned to him and, in a threatening voice:\\n\\n\"Take care! If anything happens, it will be so much the worse for you.\"\\n\\n\"Oho! It seems the other\\'s gaining on us! . . . But what are you afraid\\nof, my dear count? It\\'s no doubt a traveller . . . perhaps even some\\none they are sending to help us.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want any help,\" growled the German.\\n\\nHe leant out again. The car was only two or three hundred yards behind.\\n\\nHe said to his men, pointing to Lupin.\\n\\n\"Bind him. If he resists. . . .\"\\n\\nHe drew his revolver.\\n\\n\"Why should I resist, O gentle Teuton?\" chuckled Lupin. And he added,\\nwhile they were fastening his hands, \"It is really curious to see how\\npeople take precautions when they need not and don\\'t when they ought to.\\nWhat the devil do you care about that motor? Accomplices of mine? What\\nan idea!\"\\n\\nWithout replying, the German gave orders to the driver:\\n\\n\"To the right! . . . Slow down! . . . Let them pass. . . . If they slow\\ndown also, stop!\"\\n\\nBut, to his great surprise, the motor seemed, on the contrary, to\\nincrease its speed. It passed in front of the car like a whirlwind, in a\\ncloud of dust. Standing up at the back, leaning over the hood, which was\\nlowered, was a man dressed in black.\\n\\nHe raised his arm.\\n\\nTwo shots rang out.\\n\\nThe count, who was blocking the whole of the left window, fell back into\\nthe car.\\n\\nBefore even attending to him, the two men leapt upon Lupin and finished\\nsecuring him.\\n\\n\"Jackasses! Blockheads!\" shouted Lupin, shaking with rage. \"Let me go,\\non the contrary! There now, we\\'re stopping! But go after him, you silly\\nfools, catch him up! . . . It\\'s the man in black, I tell you, the\\nmurderer! . . . Oh, the idiots! . . .\"\\n\\nThey gagged him. Then they attended to the count. The wound did not\\nappear to be serious and was soon dressed. But the patient, who was in a\\nvery excited state, had an attack of fever and became delirious.\\n\\nIt was eight o\\'clock in the morning. They were in the open country, far\\nfrom any village. The men had no information as to the exact object of\\nthe journey. Where were they to go? Whom were they to send to?\\n\\nThey drew up the motor beside a wood and waited. The whole day went by\\nin this way. It was evening before a squad of cavalry arrived,\\ndispatched from Treves in search of the motor-car.\\n\\nTwo hours later, Lupin stepped out of the car, and still escorted by his\\ntwo Germans, by the light of a lantern climbed the steps of a staircase\\nthat led to a small room with iron-barred windows.\\n\\nHere he spent the night.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe next morning, an officer led him, through a courtyard filled with\\nsoldiers, to the centre of a long row of buildings that ran round the\\nfoot of a mound covered with monumental ruins.\\n\\nHe was shown into a large, hastily-furnished room. His visitor of two\\ndays back was sitting at a writing-table, reading newspapers and\\nreports, which he marked with great strokes of red pencil:\\n\\n\"Leave us,\" he said to the officer.\\n\\nAnd, going up to Lupin:\\n\\n\"The papers.\"\\n\\nThe tone was no longer the same. It was now the harsh and imperious tone\\nof the master who is at home and addressing an inferior . . . and such\\nan inferior! A rogue, an adventurer of the worst type, before whom he\\nhad been obliged to humiliate himself!\\n\\n\"The papers,\" he repeated.\\n\\nLupin was not put out of countenance. He said, quite calmly:\\n\\n\"They are in Veldenz Castle.\"\\n\\n\"We are in the out-buildings of the castle. Those are the ruins of\\nVeldenz, over there.\"\\n\\n\"The papers are in the ruins.\"\\n\\n\"Let us go to them. Show me the way.\"\\n\\nLupin did not budge.\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"Well, Sire, it is not as simple as you think. It takes some time to\\nbring into play the elements which are needed to open that\\nhiding-place.\"\\n\\n\"How long do you want?\"\\n\\n\"Twenty-four hours.\"\\n\\nAn angry movement, quickly suppressed:\\n\\n\"Oh, there was no question of that between us!\"\\n\\n\"Nothing was specified, neither that nor the little trip which Your\\nImperial Majesty made me take in the charge of half a dozen of your\\nbody-guard. I am to hand over the papers, that is all.\"\\n\\n\"And I am not to give you your liberty until you do hand over those\\npapers.\"\\n\\n\"It is a question of confidence, Sire. I should have considered myself\\nquite as much bound to produce the papers if I had been free on leaving\\nprison; and Your Imperial Majesty may be sure that I should not have\\nwalked off with them. The only difference is that they would now be in\\nyour possession. For we have lost a day, Sire. And a day, in this\\nbusiness . . . is a day too much. . . . Only, there it is, you should\\nhave had confidence.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor gazed with a certain amazement at that outcast, that\\nvagabond, who seemed vexed that any one should doubt his word.\\n\\nHe did not reply, but rang the bell:\\n\\n\"The officer on duty,\" he commanded.\\n\\nCount von Waldemar appeared, looking very white.\\n\\n\"Ah, it\\'s you, Waldemar? So you\\'re all right again?\"\\n\\n\"At your service, Sire.\"\\n\\n\"Take five men with you . . . the same men, as you\\'re sure of them.\\nDon\\'t leave this . . . gentleman until to-morrow morning.\" He looked at\\nhis watch. \"Until to-morrow morning at ten o\\'clock. No, I will give him\\ntill twelve. You will go wherever he thinks fit to go, you will do\\nwhatever he tells you to do. In short, you are at his disposal. At\\ntwelve o\\'clock, I will join you. If, at the last stroke of twelve, he\\nhas not handed me the bundle of letters, you will put him back in your\\ncar and, without losing a second, take him straight to the Santé\\nPrison.\"\\n\\n\"If he tries to escape. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Take your own course.\"\\n\\nHe went out.\\n\\nLupin helped himself to a cigar from the table and threw himself into an\\neasy chair:\\n\\n\"Good! I just love that way of going to work. It is frank and explicit.\"\\n\\nThe count had brought in his men. He said to Lupin:\\n\\n\"March!\"\\n\\nLupin lit his cigar and did not move.\\n\\n\"Bind his hands,\" said the count.\\n\\nAnd, when the order was executed, he repeated:\\n\\n\"Now then, march!\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean by no?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m wondering.\"\\n\\n\"What about?\"\\n\\n\"Where on earth that hiding-place can be!\"\\n\\nThe count gave a start and Lupin chuckled:\\n\\n\"For the best part of the story is that I have not the remotest idea\\nwhere that famous hiding-place is nor how to set about discovering it.\\nWhat do you say to that, my dear Waldemar, eh? Funny, isn\\'t it? . . .\\nNot the very remotest idea! . . .\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nTHE EMPEROR\\'S LETTERS\\n\\n\\nThe ruins of Veldenz are well known to all who visit the banks of the\\nRhine and the Moselle. They comprise the remains of the old feudal\\ncastle, built in 1377 by the Archbishop of Fistingen, an enormous\\ndungeon-keep, gutted by Turenne\\'s troops, and the walls, left standing\\nin their entirety, of a large Renascence palace, in which the\\ngrand-dukes of Zweibrucken lived for three centuries.\\n\\nIt was this palace that was sacked by Hermann II.\\'s rebellious subjects.\\nThe empty windows display two hundred yawning cavities on the four\\nfrontages. All the wainscoting, the hangings and most of the furniture\\nwere burnt. You walk on the scorched girders of the floors; and the sky\\ncan be seen at intervals through the ruined ceilings.\\n\\nLupin, accompanied by his escort, went over the whole building in two\\nhours\\' time:\\n\\n\"I am very pleased with you, my dear count. I don\\'t think I ever came\\nacross a guide so well posted in his subject, nor--which is rare--so\\nsilent. And now, if you don\\'t mind, we will go to lunch.\"\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, Lupin knew no more than at the first moment and his\\nperplexity did nothing but increase. To obtain his release from prison\\nand to strike the imagination of his visitor, he had bluffed, pretending\\nto know everything; and he was still seeking for the best place at\\nwhich to begin to seek.\\n\\n\"Things look bad,\" he said to himself, from time to time. \"Things are\\nlooking about as bad as they can look.\"\\n\\nHis brain, moreover, was not as clear as usual. He was obsessed by an\\nidea, the idea of \"the other one,\" the murderer, the assassin, whom he\\nknew to be still clinging to his footsteps.\\n\\nHow did that mysterious personality come to be on his tracks? How had he\\nheard of Lupin\\'s leaving prison and of his rush to Luxemburg and\\nGermany? Was it a miraculous intuition? Or was it the outcome of\\ndefinite information? But, if so, at what price, by means of what\\npromises or threats was he able to obtain it?\\n\\nAll these questions haunted Lupin\\'s mind.\\n\\nAt about four o\\'clock, however, after a fresh walk through the ruins, in\\nthe course of which he had examined the stones, measured the thickness\\nof the walls, investigated the shape and appearance of things, all to no\\npurpose, he asked the count:\\n\\n\"Is there no one left who was in the service of the last grand-duke who\\nlived in the castle?\"\\n\\n\"All the servants of that time went different ways. Only one of them\\ncontinued to live in the district.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"He died two years ago.\"\\n\\n\"Any children?\"\\n\\n\"He had a son, who married and who was dismissed, with his wife, for\\ndisgraceful conduct. They left their youngest child behind, a little\\ngirl, Isilda.\"\\n\\n\"Where does she live?\"\\n\\n\"She lives here, at the end of these buildings. The old grandfather\\nused to act as a guide to visitors, in the days when the castle was\\nstill open to the public. Little Isilda has lived in the ruins ever\\nsince. She was allowed to remain out of pity. She is a poor innocent,\\nwho is hardly able to talk and does not know what she says.\"\\n\\n\"Was she always like that?\"\\n\\n\"It seems not. Her reason went gradually, when she was about ten years\\nold.\"\\n\\n\"In consequence of a sorrow, of a fright?\"\\n\\n\"No, for no direct cause, I am told. The father was a drunkard and the\\nmother committed suicide in a fit of madness.\"\\n\\nLupin reflected and said:\\n\\n\"I should like to see her.\"\\n\\nThe count gave a rather curious smile:\\n\\n\"You can see her, by all means.\"\\n\\nShe happened to be in one of the rooms which had been set apart for her.\\nLupin was surprised to find an attractive little creature, too thin, too\\npale, but almost pretty, with her fair hair and her delicate face. Her\\nsea-green eyes had the vague, dreamy look of the eyes of blind people.\\n\\nHe put a few questions to which Isilda gave no answer and others to\\nwhich she replied with incoherent sentences, as though she understood\\nneither the meaning of the words addressed to her nor those which she\\nherself uttered.\\n\\nHe persisted, taking her very gently by the hand and asking her in an\\naffectionate tone about the time when she still had her reason, about\\nher grandfather, about the memories which might be called up by her life\\nas a child playing freely among the majestic ruins of the castle.\\n\\nShe stood silent, with staring eyes; impassive, any emotion which she\\nmight have felt was not enough to rouse her slumbering intelligence.\\n\\nLupin asked for a pencil and paper and wrote down the number 813.\\n\\nThe count smiled again.\\n\\n\"Look here, what are you laughing at?\" cried Lupin, irritably.\\n\\n\"Nothing . . . nothing. . . . I\\'m very much interested, that\\'s all.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nIsilda looked at the sheet of paper, when he showed it to her, and\\nturned away her head, with a vacant air.\\n\\n\"No bite!\" said the count, satirically.\\n\\nLupin wrote the letters \"APOON.\"\\n\\nIsilda paid no more attention than before.\\n\\nHe did not give up the experiment, but kept on writing the same letters,\\neach time watching the girl\\'s face.\\n\\nShe did not stir, but kept her eyes fixed on the paper with an\\nindifference which nothing seemed to disturb. Then, all at once, she\\nseized the pencil, snatched the last sheet out of Lupin\\'s hands and, as\\nthough acting under a sudden inspiration, wrote two \"L\\'s\" in the middle\\nof a space left open by Lupin.\\n\\nHe felt a thrill.\\n\\nA word had been formed: \"APOLLON.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Isilda clung to both pencil and paper and, with clutching\\nfingers and a strained face, was struggling to make her hand submit to\\nthe hesitating orders of her poor little brain.\\n\\nLupin waited, feverishly.\\n\\nShe rapidly wrote another word, the word \"DIANE.\"\\n\\n\"Another word! . . . Another word!\" shouted Lupin.\\n\\nShe twisted her fingers round the pencil, broke the lead, made a big \"J\"\\nwith the stump and, now utterly exhausted, dropped the pencil.\\n\\n\"Another word! I must have another word!\" said Lupin, in a tone of\\ncommand, catching her by the arm.\\n\\nBut he saw by her eyes, which had once more become indifferent, that\\nthat fleeting gleam of intelligence could not shine out again.\\n\\n\"Let us go,\" he said.\\n\\nHe was walking away, when she ran after him and stood in his path. He\\nstopped:\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\nShe held out the palm of her hand.\\n\\n\"What? Money? . . . Is she in the habit of begging?\" he asked the count.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Waldemar, \"and I can\\'t understand.\"\\n\\nIsilda took two gold coins from her pocket and chinked them together,\\ngleefully.\\n\\nLupin looked at them. They were French coins, quite new, bearing the\\ndate of that year.\\n\\n\"Where did you get these?\" asked Lupin, excitedly.\\n\\n\"French money! . . . Who gave it you? . . . And when? . . . Was it\\nto-day? Speak! . . . Answer! . . .\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"Fool\\nthat I am! As though she could answer! . . . My dear count, would you\\nmind lending me forty marks? . . . Thanks . . . Here, Isilda, that\\'s for\\nyou.\"\\n\\nShe took the two coins, jingled them with the others in the palm of her\\nhand and then, putting out her arm, pointed to the ruins of the\\nRenascence palace, with a gesture that seemed to call attention more\\nparticularly to the left wing and to the top of that wing.\\n\\nWas it a mechanical movement? Or must it be looked upon as a grateful\\nacknowledgment for the two gold coins?\\n\\nHe glanced at the count. Waldemar was smiling again.\\n\\n\"What makes the brute keep on grinning like that?\" said Lupin to\\nhimself. \"Any one would think that he was having a game with me.\"\\n\\nHe went to the palace on the off-chance, attended by his escort.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe ground-floor consisted of a number of large reception-rooms, running\\none into the other and containing the few pieces of furniture that had\\nescaped the fire.\\n\\nOn the first floor, on the north side, was a long gallery, out of which\\ntwelve handsome rooms opened all exactly alike.\\n\\nThere was a similar gallery on the second floor, but with twenty-four\\nsmaller rooms, also resembling one another. All these apartments were\\nempty, dilapidated, wretched to look at.\\n\\nAbove, there was nothing. The attics had been burnt down.\\n\\nFor an hour, Lupin walked, ran, rushed about indefatigably, with his\\neyes on the look-out.\\n\\nWhen it began to grow dusk, he hurried to one of his twelve rooms on the\\nfirst floor, as if he were selecting it for special reasons known to\\nhimself alone. He was rather surprised to find the Emperor there,\\nsmoking and seated in an arm-chair which he had sent for.\\n\\nTaking no notice of his presence, Lupin began an inspection of the room,\\naccording to the methods which he was accustomed to employ in such\\ncases, dividing the room into sections, each of which he examined in\\nturn.\\n\\nAfter twenty minutes of this work, he said:\\n\\n\"I must beg you, Sire, to be good enough to move. There is a fireplace\\nhere. . . .\"\\n\\nThe Emperor tossed his head:\\n\\n\"Is it really necessary for me to move?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire, this fireplace . . .\"\\n\\n\"The fireplace is just the same as the others and the room is no\\ndifferent from its fellows.\"\\n\\nLupin looked at the Emperor without understanding. The Emperor rose and\\nsaid, with a laugh:\\n\\n\"I think, M. Lupin, that you have been making just a little fun of me.\"\\n\\n\"How do you mean, Sire?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s hardly worth mentioning! You obtained your release on the\\ncondition of handing me certain papers in which I am interested and you\\nhave not the smallest notion as to where they are. I have been\\nthoroughly--what do you call it, in French?--_roulé_ \\'done\\'!\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so, Sire?\"\\n\\n\"Why, what a man knows he doesn\\'t have to hunt for! And you have been\\nhunting for ten good hours! Doesn\\'t it strike you as a case for an\\nimmediate return to prison?\"\\n\\nLupin seemed thunderstruck:\\n\\n\"Did not Your Imperial Majesty fix twelve o\\'clock to-morrow as the last\\nlimit?\"\\n\\n\"Why wait?\"\\n\\n\"Why? Well, to allow me to complete my work!\"\\n\\n\"Your work? But it\\'s not even begun, M. Lupin.\"\\n\\n\"There Your Imperial Majesty is mistaken.\"\\n\\n\"Prove it . . . and I will wait until to-morrow.\"\\n\\nLupin reflected and, speaking in a serious tone:\\n\\n\"Since Your Imperial Majesty requires proofs in order to have\\nconfidence in me, I will furnish them. The twelve rooms leading out of\\nthis gallery each bear a different name, which is inscribed in\\nFrench--obviously by a French decorative artist--over the various doors.\\nOne of the inscriptions, less damaged by the fire than the others,\\ncaught my eye as I was passing along the gallery. I examined the other\\ndoors: all of them bore hardly legible traces of names caned over the\\npediments. Thus I found a \\'D\\' and an \\'E\\' the first and last letters of\\n\\'Diane.\\' I found an \\'A\\' and \\'LON\\' which pointed to \\'Apollon.\\' These are\\nthe French equivalents of Diana and Apollo, both of them mythological\\ndeities. The other inscriptions presented similar characteristics. I\\ndiscovered traces of such names as Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Saturn and\\nso on. This part of the problem was solved: each of the twelve rooms\\nbears the name of an Olympian god or goddess; and the letters APOON,\\ncompleted by Isilda, point to the Apollo Room or Salle d\\'Apollon. So it\\nis here, in the room in which we now are, that the letters are hidden. A\\nfew minutes, perhaps, will suffice in which to discover them.\"\\n\\n\"A few minutes or a few years . . . or even longer!\" said the Emperor,\\nlaughing.\\n\\nHe seemed greatly amused; and the count also displayed a coarse\\nmerriment.\\n\\nLupin asked:\\n\\n\"Would Your Imperial Majesty be good enough to explain?\"\\n\\n\"M. Lupin, the exciting investigation which you have conducted to-day\\nand of which you are telling us the brilliant results has already been\\nmade by me . . . yes, a fortnight ago, in the company of your friend\\nHolmlock Shears. Together we questioned little Isilda; together, we\\nemployed the same method in dealing with her that you did; and together\\nwe observed the names in the gallery and got as far as this room, the\\nApollo Room.\"\\n\\nLupin turned livid. He spluttered:\\n\\n\"Oh, did Shears get . . . as far as . . . this?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, after four days\\' searching. True, it did not help us, for we found\\nnothing. All the same, I know that the letters are not here.\"\\n\\nTrembling with rage, wounded in his innermost pride, Lupin fired up\\nunder the gibe, as though he had been lashed with a whip. He had never\\nfelt humiliated to such a degree as this. In this fury, he could have\\nstrangled the fat Waldemar, whose laughter incensed him. Containing\\nhimself with an effort, he said:\\n\\n\"It took Shears four days, Sire, and me only four hours. And I should\\nhave required even less, if I had not been thwarted in my search.\"\\n\\n\"And by whom, bless my soul? By my faithful count? I hope he did not\\ndare . . . !\"\\n\\n\"No, Sire, but by the most terrible and powerful of my enemies, by that\\ninfernal being who killed his own accomplice Altenheim.\"\\n\\n\"Is he here? Do you think so?\" exclaimed the Emperor, with an agitation\\nwhich showed that he was familiar with every detail of the dramatic\\nstory.\\n\\n\"He is wherever I am. He threatens me with his constant hatred. It was\\nhe who guessed that I was M. Lenormand, the chief of the\\ndetective-service; it was he who had me put in prison; it was he, again,\\nwho pursued me, on the day when I came out. Yesterday, aiming at me in\\nthe motor, he wounded Count von Waldemar.\"\\n\\n\"But how do you know, how can you be sure that he is at Veldenz?\"\\n\\n\"Isilda has received two gold coins, two French coins!\"\\n\\n\"And what is he here for? With what object?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, Sire, but he is the very spirit of evil. Your Imperial\\nMajesty must be on your guard: he is capable of anything and\\neverything.\"\\n\\n\"It is impossible! I have two hundred men in the ruins. He cannot have\\nentered. He would have been seen.\"\\n\\n\"Some one has seen him, beyond a doubt.\"\\n\\n\"Who?\"\\n\\n\"Isilda.\"\\n\\n\"Let her be questioned! Waldemar, take your prisoner to where the girl\\nis.\"\\n\\nLupin showed his bound hands:\\n\\n\"It will be a tough battle. Can I fight like this?\"\\n\\nThe Emperor said to the count:\\n\\n\"Unfasten him. . . . And keep me informed.\"\\n\\nIn this way, by a sudden effort, bringing the hateful vision of the\\nmurder into the discussion, boldly, without evidence, Arsène Lupin\\ngained time and resumed the direction of the search:\\n\\n\"Sixteen hours still,\" he said to himself, \"it\\'s more than I want.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nHe reached the premises occupied by Isilda, at the end of the old\\nout-buildings. These buildings served as barracks for the two hundred\\nsoldiers guarding the ruins; and the whole of this, the left wing, was\\nreserved for the officers.\\n\\nIsilda was not there. The count sent two of his men to look for her.\\nThey came back. No one had seen the girl.\\n\\nNevertheless, she could not have left the precincts of the ruins. As for\\nthe Renascence palace, it was, so to speak, invested by one-half of the\\ntroops; and no one was able to obtain admittance.\\n\\nAt last, the wife of a subaltern who lived in the next house declared\\nthat she had been sitting at her window all day and that the girl had\\nnot been out.\\n\\n\"If she hadn\\'t gone out,\" said Waldemar, \"she would be here now: and she\\nis not here.\"\\n\\nLupin observed:\\n\\n\"Is there a floor above?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but from this room to the upper floor there is no staircase.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, there is.\"\\n\\nHe pointed to a little door opening on a dark recess. In the shadow, he\\nsaw the first treads of a staircase as steep as a ladder.\\n\\n\"Please, my dear count,\" he said to Waldemar, who wanted to go up, \"let\\nme have the honor.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s danger.\"\\n\\nHe ran up and at once sprang into a low and narrow loft. A cry escaped\\nhim:\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\" asked the count, emerging in his turn.\\n\\n\"Here . . . on the floor. . . . Isilda. . . .\"\\n\\nHe knelt down beside the girl, but, at the first glance, saw that she\\nwas simply stunned and that she bore no trace of a wound, except a few\\nscratches on the wrists and hands. A handkerchief was stuffed into her\\nmouth by way of a gag.\\n\\n\"That\\'s it,\" he said. \"The murderer was here with her. When we came, he\\nstruck her a blow with his fist and gagged her so that we should not\\nhear her moans.\"\\n\\n\"But how did he get away?\"\\n\\n\"Through here . . . look . . . there is a passage connecting all the\\nattics on the first floor.\"\\n\\n\"And from there?\"\\n\\n\"From there, he went down the stairs of one of the other dwellings.\"\\n\\n\"But he would have been seen!\"\\n\\n\"Pooh, who knows? The creature\\'s invisible. Never mind! Send your men to\\nlook. Tell them to search all the attics and all the ground-floor\\nlodgings.\"\\n\\nHe hesitated. Should he also go in pursuit of the murderer?\\n\\nBut a sound brought him back to the girl\\'s side. She had got up from the\\nfloor and a dozen pieces of gold money had dropped from her hands. He\\nexamined them. They were all French.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" he said, \"I was right! Only, why so much gold? In reward for\\nwhat?\"\\n\\nSuddenly, he caught sight of a book on the floor and stooped to pick it\\nup. But the girl darted forward with a quicker movement, seized the book\\nand pressed it to her bosom with a fierce energy, as though prepared to\\ndefend it against any attempt to take hold of it.\\n\\n\"That\\'s it,\" he said. \"The money was offered her for the book, but she\\nrefused to part with it. Hence the scratches on the hands. The\\ninteresting thing would be to know why the murderer wished to possess\\nthe book. Was he able to look through it first?\"\\n\\nHe said to Waldemar:\\n\\n\"My dear count, please give the order.\"\\n\\nWaldemar made a sign to his men. Three of them threw themselves on the\\ngirl and, after a hard tussle, in which the poor thing stamped, writhed\\nand screamed with rage, they took the volume from her.\\n\\n\"Gently, child,\" said Lupin, \"be calm. . . . It\\'s all in a good cause.\\n. . . Keep an eye on her, will you? Meanwhile, I will have a look at the\\nobject in dispute.\"\\n\\nIt was an odd volume of Montesquieu\\'s _Voyage au temple de Guide_, in a\\nbinding at least a century old. But Lupin had hardly opened it before he\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n\"I say, I say, this is queer! There is a sheet of parchment stuck on\\neach right hand page; and those sheets are covered with a very close,\\nsmall handwriting.\"\\n\\nHe read, at the beginning:\\n\\n      \"_Diary of the Chevalier GILLES DE MALRÊCHE, French\\n      servant to His Royal Highness the Prince of\\n      ZWEIBRUCKENVELDENZ, begun in the Year of Our Lord\\n      1794._\"\\n\\n\"What! Does it say that?\" asked the count.\\n\\n\"What surprises you?\"\\n\\n\"Isilda\\'s grandfather, the old man who died two years ago, was called\\nMalreich, which is the German form of the same name.\"\\n\\n\"Capital! Isilda\\'s grandfather must have been the son or the grandson of\\nthe French servant who wrote his diary in an odd volume of Montesquieu\\'s\\nworks. And that is how the diary came into Isilda\\'s hands.\"\\n\\nHe turned the pages at random:\\n\\n      \"_15 September, 1796._ His Royal Highness went\\n      hunting.\\n\\n      \"_20 September, 1796._ His Royal Highness went out\\n      riding. He was mounted on Cupidon.\"\\n\\n\"By Jove!\" muttered Lupin. \"So far, it\\'s not very exciting.\"\\n\\nHe turned over a number of pages and read:\\n\\n      \"_12 March, 1803._ I have remitted ten crowns to\\n      Hermann. He is giving music-lessons in London.\"\\n\\nLupin gave a laugh:\\n\\n\"Oho! Hermann is dethroned and our respect comes down with a rush!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" observed Waldemar, \"the reigning grand-duke was driven from his\\ndominions by the French troops.\"\\n\\nLupin continued:\\n\\n      \"_1809. Tuesday._ Napoleon slept at Veldenz last\\n      night. I made His Majesty\\'s bed and this morning I\\n      emptied his slops.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, did Napoleon stop at Veldenz?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, on his way back to the army, at the time of the Austrian\\ncampaign, which ended with the battle of Wagram. It was an honor of\\nwhich the grand-duchal family were very proud afterwards.\"\\n\\nLupin went on reading:\\n\\n      \"_28 October, 1814._ His Royal Highness returned to\\n      his dominions.\\n\\n      \"_29 October, 1814._ I accompanied His Royal Highness\\n      to the hiding-place last night and was happy to be\\n      able to show him that no one had guessed its\\n      existence. For that matter, who would have suspected\\n      that a hiding-place could be contrived in . . .\"\\n\\nLupin stopped, with a shout. Isilda had suddenly escaped from the men\\nguarding her, made a grab at him and taken to flight, carrying the book\\nwith her.\\n\\n\"Oh, the little mischief! Quick, you! . . . Go round by the stairs\\nbelow. I\\'ll run after her by the passage.\"\\n\\nBut she had slammed the door behind her and bolted it. He had to go down\\nand run along the buildings with the others, looking for a staircase\\nwhich would take them to the first floor.\\n\\nThe fourth house was the only one open. He went upstairs. But the\\npassage was empty and he had to knock at doors, force locks and make his\\nway into unoccupied rooms, while Waldemar, showing as much ardor in the\\npursuit as himself, pricked the curtains and hangings with the point of\\nhis sword.\\n\\nA voice called out from the ground-floor, towards the right wing. They\\nrushed in that direction. It was one of the officers\\' wives, who\\nbeckoned to them at the end of a passage and told them that the girl\\nmust be in her lodging.\\n\\n\"How do you know?\" asked Lupin.\\n\\n\"I wanted to go to my room. The door was shut and I could not get in.\"\\n\\nLupin tried and found the door locked:\\n\\n\"The window!\" he cried. \"There must be a window!\"\\n\\nHe went outside, took the count\\'s sword and smashed the panes. Then,\\nhelped up by two men, he hung on to the wall, passed his arm through the\\nbroken glass, turned the latch and stumbled into the room.\\n\\nHe saw Isilda huddled before the fireplace, almost in the midst of the\\nflames:\\n\\n\"The little beast!\" he said. \"She has thrown it into the fire!\"\\n\\nHe pushed her back savagely, tried to take the book and burnt his hands\\nin the attempt. Then, with the tongs, he pulled it out of the grate and\\nthrew the table cloth over it to stifle the blaze.\\n\\nBut it was too late. The pages of the old manuscript, all burnt up, were\\nfalling into ashes.\\n\\nLupin gazed at her in silence. The count said:\\n\\n\"One would think that she knew what she was doing.\"\\n\\n\"No, she does not know. Only, her grandfather must have entrusted her\\nwith that book as a sort of treasure, a treasure which no one was ever\\nto set eyes on, and, with her stupid instinct, she preferred to throw it\\ninto the fire rather than part with it.\"\\n\\n\"Well then. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Well then what?\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t find the hiding-place.\"\\n\\n\"Aha, my dear count, so you did, for a moment, look upon my success as\\npossible? And Lupin does not strike you as quite a charlatan? Make your\\nmind easy, Waldemar: Lupin has more than one string to his bow. I shall\\nsucceed.\"\\n\\n\"Before twelve o\\'clock to-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"Before twelve o\\'clock to-night. But, for the moment, I am starving with\\nhunger. And, if your kindness would go so far. . . .\"\\n\\nHe was taken to the sergeants\\' mess and a substantial meal prepared for\\nhim, while the count went to make his report to the Emperor.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTwenty minutes later, Waldemar returned and they sat down and dined\\ntogether, opposite each other, silent and pensive.\\n\\n\"Waldemar, a good cigar would be a treat. . . . I thank you. . . . Ah,\\nthis one crackles as a self-respecting Havana should!\"\\n\\nHe lit his cigar and, after a minute or two:\\n\\n\"You can smoke, count; I don\\'t mind in the least; in fact, I rather like\\nit.\"\\n\\nAn hour passed. Waldemar dozed and, from time to time, swallowed a glass\\nof brandy to wake himself up.\\n\\nSoldiers passed in and out, waiting on them.\\n\\n\"Coffee,\" asked Lupin.\\n\\nThey brought him some coffee.\\n\\n\"What bad stuff!\" he grumbled. \"If that\\'s what Cæsar drinks! . . . Give\\nme another cup all the same, Waldemar. We may have a long night before\\nus. Oh, what vile coffee!\"\\n\\nHe lit a second cigar and did not say another word. Ten minutes passed.\\nHe continued not to move or speak.\\n\\nSuddenly, Waldemar sprang to his feet and said to Lupin, angrily:\\n\\n\"Hi! Stand up, there!\"\\n\\nLupin was whistling a tune at the moment. He kept on whistling,\\npeacefully.\\n\\n\"Stand up, I say!\"\\n\\nLupin turned round. His Imperial Majesty had just entered. Lupin rose\\nfrom his chair.\\n\\n\"How far are we?\" asked the Emperor.\\n\\n\"I think, Sire, that I shall be able to satisfy Your Imperial Majesty\\nsoon.\"\\n\\n\"What? Do you know . . .\"\\n\\n\"The hiding-place? Very nearly, Sire. . . . A few details still escape\\nme . . . but everything will be cleared up, once we are on the spot: I\\nhave no doubt of it.\"\\n\\n\"Are we to stay here?\"\\n\\n\"No, Sire, I will beg you to go with me to the Renascence palace. But we\\nhave plenty of time; and, if Your Imperial Majesty will permit me, I\\nshould like first to think over two or three points.\"\\n\\nWithout waiting for the reply, he sat down, to Waldemar\\'s great\\nindignation.\\n\\nIn a few minutes, the Emperor, who had walked away and was talking to\\nthe count, came up to him:\\n\\n\"Are you ready now, M. Lupin?\"\\n\\nLupin kept silence. A fresh question. His head fell on his chest.\\n\\n\"But he\\'s asleep; I really believe that he\\'s asleep!\"\\n\\nWaldemar, beside himself with rage, shook him violently by the shoulder.\\nLupin fell from his chair, sank to the floor, gave two or three\\nconvulsive movements and then lay quite still.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter with him?\" exclaimed the Emperor. \"He\\'s not dead, I\\nhope!\"\\n\\nHe took a lamp and bent over him:\\n\\n\"How pale he is! A face like wax! . . . Look, Waldemar. . . . Feel his\\nheart. . . . He\\'s alive, is he not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire,\" said the count, after a moment, \"the heart is beating quite\\nregularly.\"\\n\\n\"Then what is it? I don\\'t understand. . . . What happened?\"\\n\\n\"Shall I go and fetch the doctor?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, run. . . .\"\\n\\nThe doctor found Lupin in the same state, lying inert and quiet. He had\\nhim put on a bed, subjected him to a long examination and asked what he\\nhad had to eat.\\n\\n\"Do you suspect a case of poisoning, doctor?\"\\n\\n\"No, Sire, there are no traces of poisoning. But I am thinking . . .\\nwhat\\'s on that tray and in that cup?\"\\n\\n\"Coffee,\" said the count.\\n\\n\"For you?\"\\n\\n\"No, for him. I did not have any.\"\\n\\nThe doctor poured out some coffee, tasted it and said:\\n\\n\"I was right. He has been put to sleep with a narcotic.\"\\n\\n\"But by whom?\" cried the Emperor, angrily. \"Look here, Waldemar; it\\'s\\nexasperating, the way things happen in this place!\"\\n\\n\"Sire? . . .\"\\n\\n\"Well, yes, I\\'ve had enough of it! . . . I am really beginning to\\nbelieve that the man\\'s right and that there is some one in the castle.\\n. . . That French money, that narcotic. . . .\"\\n\\n\"If any one had got into this enclosure, Sire, it would be known by this\\ntime. . . . We\\'ve been hunting in every direction for three hours.\"\\n\\n\"Still, I didn\\'t make the coffee, I assure you. . . . And, unless you\\ndid. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Sire!\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, hunt about . . . search. . . . You have two hundred men at\\nyour disposal; and the out-houses are not so large as all that! For,\\nafter all, the ruffian is prowling round here, round these buildings\\n. . . near the kitchen . . . somewhere or other! Go and bustle about!\"\\n\\nThe fat Waldemar bustled about all night, conscientiously, because it\\nwas the master\\'s order, but without conviction, because it was\\nimpossible for a stranger to hide among ruins which were so\\nwell-watched. And, as a matter of fact, the event proved that he was\\nright: the investigations were fruitless; and no one was able to\\ndiscover the mysterious hand that had prepared the narcotic drink.\\n\\nLupin spent the night lifeless on his bed. In the morning, the doctor,\\nwho had not left his side, told a messenger of the Emperor\\'s that he was\\nstill asleep.\\n\\nAt nine o\\'clock, however, he made his first movement, a sort of effort\\nto wake up.\\n\\nLater on, he stammered:\\n\\n\"What time is it?\"\\n\\n\"Twenty-five to ten.\"\\n\\nHe made a fresh effort; and it was evident that, in the midst of his\\ntorpor, his whole being was intent upon returning to life.\\n\\nA clock struck ten.\\n\\nHe started and said:\\n\\n\"Let them carry me; let them carry me to the palace.\"\\n\\nWith the doctor\\'s approval, Waldemar called his men and sent word to the\\nEmperor. They laid Lupin on a stretcher and set out for the palace.\\n\\n\"The first floor,\" he muttered.\\n\\nThey carried him up.\\n\\n\"At the end of the corridor,\" he said. \"The last room on the left.\"\\n\\nThey carried him to the last room, which was the twelfth, and gave him a\\nchair, on which he sat down, exhausted.\\n\\nThe Emperor arrived: Lupin did not stir, sat looking, unconscious, with\\nno expression in his eyes.\\n\\nThen, in a few minutes, he seemed to wake, looked round him, at the\\nwalls, the ceilings, the people, and said:\\n\\n\"A narcotic, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor.\\n\\n\"Have they found . . . the man?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\nHe seemed to be meditating and several times jerked his head with a\\nthoughtful air: but they soon saw that he was asleep.\\n\\nThe Emperor went up to Waldemar:\\n\\n\"Order your car round.\"\\n\\n\"Oh? . . . But then, Sire . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"Well, what? I am beginning to think that he is taking us in and that\\nall this is merely play-acting, to gain time.\"\\n\\n\"Possibly . . . yes . . .\" said Waldemar, agreeing.\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite obvious! He is making the most of certain curious\\ncoincidences, but he knows nothing; and his story about gold coins and\\nhis narcotic are so many inventions! If we lend ourselves to his little\\ngame any longer, he\\'ll slip out of your fingers. Your car, Waldemar.\"\\n\\nThe count gave his orders and returned. Lupin had not woke up. The\\nEmperor, who was looking round the room, said to Waldemar:\\n\\n\"This is the Minerva room, is it not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire.\"\\n\\n\"But then why is there an \\'N\\' in two places?\"\\n\\nThere were, in fact, two \"N\\'s,\" one over the chimneypiece, the other\\nover an old dilapidated clock fitted into the wall and displaying a\\ncomplicated set of works, with weights hanging lifeless at the end of\\ntheir cords.\\n\\n\"The two \\'N\\'s\\' . . .\" said Waldemar.\\n\\nThe Emperor did not listen to the answer. Lupin had moved again, opening\\nhis eyes and uttering indistinct syllables. He stood up, walked across\\nthe room and fell down from sheer weakness.\\n\\nThen came the struggle, the desperate struggle of his brain, his nerves,\\nhis will against that hideous, paralyzing torpor, the struggle of a\\ndying man against death, the struggle of life against extinction. And\\nthe sight was one of infinite sadness.\\n\\n\"He is suffering,\" muttered Waldemar.\\n\\n\"Or at least, he is pretending to suffer,\" declared the Emperor, \"and\\npretending very cleverly at that. What an actor!\"\\n\\nLupin stammered:\\n\\n\"An injection, doctor, an injection of caffeine . . . at once. . . .\"\\n\\n\"May I, Sire?\" asked the doctor.\\n\\n\"Certainly. . . . Until twelve o\\'clock, do all that he asks. He has my\\npromise.\"\\n\\n\"How many minutes . . . before twelve o\\'clock?\" asked Lupin.\\n\\n\"Forty,\" said somebody.\\n\\n\"Forty? . . . I shall do it. . . . I am sure to do it. . . . I\\'ve got to\\ndo it. . . .\" He took his head in his two hands. \"Oh, if I had my brain,\\nthe real brain, the brain that thinks! It would be a matter of a second!\\nThere is only one dark spot left . . . but I cannot . . . my thoughts\\nescape me. . . . I can\\'t grasp it . . . it\\'s awful.\"\\n\\nHis shoulders shook. Was he crying?\\n\\nThey heard him repeating:\\n\\n\"813 . . . 813. . . .\" And, in a lower voice, \"813 . . . an \\'8\\' . . . a\\n\\'1\\' . . . a \\'3\\' . . . yes, of course. . . . But why? . . . That\\'s not\\nenough. . . .\"\\n\\nThe Emperor muttered:\\n\\n\"He impresses me. I find it difficult to believe that a man can play a\\npart like that. . . .\"\\n\\nHalf-past eleven struck . . . a quarter to twelve. . . .\\n\\nLupin remained motionless, with his fists glued to his temples.\\n\\nThe Emperor waited, with his eyes fixed on a chronometer which Waldemar\\nheld in his hand.\\n\\nTen minutes more . . . five minutes more . . .\\n\\n\"Is the car there, Waldemar? . . . Are your men ready?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire.\"\\n\\n\"Is that watch of yours a repeater, Waldemar?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire.\"\\n\\n\"At the last stroke of twelve, then. . . .\"\\n\\n\"But . . .\"\\n\\n\"At the last stroke of twelve, Waldemar.\"\\n\\nThere was really something tragic about the scene, that sort of grandeur\\nand solemnity which the hours assume at the approach of a possible\\nmiracle, when it seems as though the voice of fate itself were about to\\nfind utterance.\\n\\nThe Emperor did not conceal his anguish. This fantastic adventurer who\\nwas called Arsène Lupin and whose amazing life he knew, this man\\ntroubled him . . . and, although he was resolved to make an end of all\\nthis dubious story, he could not help waiting . . . and hoping.\\n\\nTwo minutes more . . . one minute more . . .\\n\\nThen they counted by seconds.\\n\\nLupin seemed asleep.\\n\\n\"Come, get ready,\" said the Emperor to the count.\\n\\nThe count went up to Lupin and placed his hand on his shoulder.\\n\\nThe silvery chime of the repeater quivered and struck . . . one, two,\\nthree, four, five . . .\\n\\n\"Waldemar, old chap, pull the weights of the old clock.\"\\n\\nA moment of stupefaction. It was Lupin\\'s voice, speaking very calmly.\\n\\nWaldemar, annoyed at the familiarity of the address, shrugged his\\nshoulders.\\n\\n\"Do as he says, Waldemar,\" said the Emperor.\\n\\n\"Yes, do as I say, my dear count,\" echoed Lupin, recovering his powers\\nof chaff. \"You know the ropes so well . . . all you have to do is to\\npull those of the clock . . . in turns . . . one, two . . . capital!\\n. . . That\\'s how they used to wind it up in the old days.\"\\n\\nThe pendulum, in fact, was started; and they heard its regular ticking.\\n\\n\"Now the hands,\" said Lupin. \"Set them at a little before twelve . . .\\nDon\\'t move . . . Let me . . .\"\\n\\nHe rose and walked to the face of the clock, standing two feet away, at\\nmost, with his eyes fixed, with every nerve attentive.\\n\\nThe twelve strokes sounded, twelve heavy, deep strokes.\\n\\nA long silence. Nothing happened. Nevertheless, the Emperor waited, as\\nthough he were sure that something was going to happen. And Waldemar did\\nnot move, stood with wide-open eyes.\\n\\nLupin, who had stooped over the clock-face, now drew himself up,\\nmuttering:\\n\\n\"That\\'s it . . . I have it. . . .\"\\n\\nHe went back to his chair and commanded:\\n\\n\"Waldemar, set the hands at two minutes to twelve again. Oh, no, old\\nchap, not backwards! The way the hands go! . . . Yes, I know, it will\\ntake rather long . . . but it can\\'t be helped.\"\\n\\nAll the hours struck and the half hours, up to half-past eleven.\\n\\n\"Listen, Waldemar,\" said Lupin.\\n\\nAnd he spoke seriously, without jesting, as though himself excited and\\nanxious:\\n\\n\"Listen, Waldemar. Do you see on the face of the clock a little round\\ndot marking the first hour? That dot is loose, isn\\'t it? Put the\\nfore-finger of your left hand on it and press. Good. Do the same with\\nyour thumb on the dot marking the third hour. Good. With your right\\nhand, push in the dot at the eighth hour. Good. Thank you. Go and sit\\ndown, my dear fellow.\"\\n\\nThe minute-hand shifted, moved to the twelfth dot and the clock struck\\nagain.\\n\\nLupin was silent and very white. The twelve strokes rang out in the\\nsilence.\\n\\nAt the twelfth stroke, there was a sound as of a spring being set free.\\nThe clock stopped dead. The pendulum ceased swinging.\\n\\nAnd suddenly, the bronze ornament representing a ram\\'s head, which\\ncrowned the dial, fell forwards, uncovering a sort of little recess cut\\nout of the stone wall.\\n\\nIn this recess was a chased silver casket.\\n\\nLupin took it and carried it to the Emperor:\\n\\n\"Would Your Imperial Majesty be so good as to open it yourself? The\\nletters which you instructed me to look for are inside.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor raised the lid and seemed greatly astonished.\\n\\n_The casket was empty._\\n\\nThe casket was empty.\\n\\nIt was an enormous, unforeseen sensation. After the success of the\\ncalculation made by Lupin, after the ingenious discovery of the secret\\nof the clock, the Emperor, who had no doubt left as to the ultimate\\nsuccess, appeared utterly confounded.\\n\\nOpposite him was Lupin, pallid and wan, with drawn jaws and bloodshot\\neyes, gnashing his teeth with rage and impotent hate.\\n\\nHe wiped the perspiration from his forehead, then snatched up the\\ncasket, turned it over, examined it, as though he hoped to find a false\\nbottom. At last, for greater certainty, in a fit of fury, he crushed it,\\nwith an irresistible grip.\\n\\nThat relieved him. He breathed more easily.\\n\\nThe Emperor said:\\n\\n\"Who has done this?\"\\n\\n\"Still the same man, Sire, the one who is following the same road as I\\nand pursuing the same aim: Mr. Kesselbach\\'s murderer.\"\\n\\n\"When?\"\\n\\n\"Last night. Ah, Sire, why did you not leave me free when I came out of\\nprison! Had I been free, I should have come here without losing an hour.\\nI should have arrived before him! I should have given Isilda money\\nbefore he did! I should have read Malreich, the old French servant\\'s\\ndiary, before he did!\"\\n\\n\"So you think that it was through the revelations in the diary . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, Sire! He had time to read them. And, lurking I don\\'t know\\nwhere, kept informed of all our movements by I don\\'t know whom, he put\\nme to sleep last night, in order to get rid of me.\"\\n\\n\"But the palace was guarded.\"\\n\\n\"Guarded by your soldiers, Sire. Does that count with a man like him?\\nBesides, I have no doubt that Waldemar concentrated his search upon the\\nout-buildings, thus thinning the posts in the palace.\"\\n\\n\"But the sound of the clock! Those twelve strokes in the night!\"\\n\\n\"It was mere child\\'s play, Sire, mere child\\'s play, to him, to prevent\\nthe clock from striking!\"\\n\\n\"All this seems very impossible to my mind.\"\\n\\n\"It all seems monstrous clear to mine, Sire! If it were possible to feel\\nin every one of your soldiers\\' pockets here and now, or to know how much\\nmoney they will each of them spend during the next twelve months, we\\nshould be sure to find two or three who are, at this moment, in\\npossession of a few bank-notes: French bank-notes, of course.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" protested Waldemar.\\n\\n\"But yes, my dear count, it is a question of price; and that makes no\\ndifference to \\'him.\\' If \\'he\\' wished, I am sure that you yourself . . .\"\\n\\nThe Emperor, wrapped up in his own thoughts, was not listening. He\\nwalked across the room from left to right and right to left, then\\nbeckoned to one of the officers standing in the gallery:\\n\\n\"My car. . . . And tell them to get ready. . . . We\\'re starting.\"\\n\\nHe stopped, watched Lupin for a moment and, going up to the count:\\n\\n\"You too, Waldemar, be off . . . Straight to Paris, without a break\\n. . .\"\\n\\nLupin pricked up his ears. He heard Waldemar reply:\\n\\n\"I should like to have a dozen additional guards. . . . With that devil\\nof a man. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Take them. And look sharp. You must get there to-night.\"\\n\\nLupin stamped his foot violently on the floor:\\n\\n\"Well, no, Sire! No, no, no! It shan\\'t be, I swear it shan\\'t! No, no\\nnever!\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"And the letters, Sire? The stolen letters?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word! . . .\"\\n\\n\"So!\" cried Lupin, indignantly folding his arms. \"So your Imperial\\nMajesty gives up the struggle? You look upon the defeat as\\nirretrievable? You declare yourself beaten? Well, I do not, Sire. I have\\nbegun and I mean to finish.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor smiled at this display of mettle:\\n\\n\"I do not give up, but my police will set to work.\"\\n\\nLupin burst out laughing:\\n\\n\"Excuse me, Sire! It is so funny! Your police! Your Imperial Majesty\\'s\\npolice! Why, they\\'re worth just about as much as any other police, that\\nis to say, nothing, nothing at all! No, Sire, I will not return to the\\nSanté! Prison I can afford to laugh at. But time enough has been wasted\\nas it is. I need my freedom against that man and I mean to keep it.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor shrugged his shoulders:\\n\\n\"You don\\'t even know who the man is.\"\\n\\n\"I shall know, Sire. And I alone can know. And he knows that I am the\\nonly one who can know. I am his only enemy. I am the only one whom he\\nattacks. It was I whom he meant to hit, the other day, when he fired his\\nrevolver. He considered it enough to put me and me only to sleep, last\\nnight, to be free to do as he pleased. The fight lies between him and\\nme. The outside world has nothing to say to it. No one can help me and\\nno one can help him. There are two of us; and that is all. So far,\\nchance has favored him. But, in the long run, it is inevitable, it is\\ndoomed that I should gain the day.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because I am the better man.\"\\n\\n\"Suppose he kills you?\"\\n\\n\"He will not kill me. I shall draw his claws, I shall make him perfectly\\nharmless. And you shall have the letters, Sire. They are yours. There is\\nno power on earth than can prevent me from restoring them to you.\"\\n\\nHe spoke with a violent conviction and a tone of certainty that gave to\\nthe things which he foretold the real appearance of things already\\naccomplished.\\n\\nThe Emperor could not help undergoing a vague, inexplicable feeling in\\nwhich there was a sort of admiration combined with a good deal of that\\nconfidence which Lupin was demanding in so masterful a manner. In\\nreality, he was hesitating only because of his scruples against\\nemploying this man and making him, so to speak, his ally. And,\\nanxiously, not knowing what decision to take, he walked from the gallery\\nto the windows without saying a word.\\n\\nAt last, he asked:\\n\\n\"And who says that the letters were stolen last night?\"\\n\\n\"The theft is dated, Sire.\"\\n\\n\"What do you say?\"\\n\\n\"Look at the inner side of the pediment which concealed the\\nhiding-place. The date is written in white chalk: \\'Midnight, 24 August.\\'\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"So it is,\" muttered the Emperor, nonplussed. \"How was it that I did not\\nsee?\" And he added, betraying his curiosity, \"Just as with those two\\n\\'N\\'s\\' painted on the wall. . . . I can\\'t understand. This is the\\nMinerva Room.\"\\n\\n\"This is the room in which Napoleon, the Emperor of the French slept,\"\\nsaid Lupin.\\n\\n\"How do you know?\"\\n\\n\"Ask Waldemar, Sire. As for myself, when I was turning over the old\\nservants\\' diary, it came upon me as a flash of light. I understood that\\nShears and I had been on the wrong scent. APOON, the imperfect word\\nwritten by the Grand-duke Hermann on his death-bed, is a contraction not\\nof Apollon, but of Napoleon.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true . . . you are right,\" said the Emperor. \"The same letters\\noccur in both words and in the same order. The grand-duke evidently\\nmeant to write \\'Napoleon.\\' But that figure 813? . . .\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that was the point that gave me most trouble. I always had an idea\\nthat we must add up the three figures 8, 1 and 3; and the number 12,\\nthus obtained, seemed to me at once to apply to this room, which is the\\ntwelfth leading out of the gallery. But that was not enough for me.\\nThere must be something else, something which my enfeebled brain could\\nnot succeed in translating into words. The sight of that clock, situated\\nprecisely in the Napoleon Room, was a revelation to me. The number 12\\nevidently meant twelve o\\'clock. The hour of noon! The hour of midnight!\\nIs this not the solemn moment which a man most readily selects? But why\\nthose three figures 8, 1 and 3, rather than any others which would have\\ngiven the same total? . . . It was then that I thought of making the\\nclock strike for the first time, by way of experiment. And it was while\\nmaking it strike that I saw the dots of the first, third and eighth\\nhour were movable and that they alone were movable. I therefore obtained\\nthree figures, 1, 3 and 8, which, placed in a more prophetic order, gave\\nthe number 813. Waldemar pushed the three dots, the spring was released\\nand Your Imperial Majesty knows the result. . . . This, Sire, is the\\nexplanation of that mysterious word and of those three figures 8, 1, 3\\nwhich the grand-duke wrote with his dying hand and by the aid of which\\nhe hoped that his son would one day recover the secret of Veldenz and\\nbecome the possessor of the famous letters which he had hidden there.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor listened with eager attention, more and more surprised at\\nthe ingenuity, perspicacity, shrewdness and intelligent will which he\\nobserved in the man.\\n\\n\"Waldemar,\" he said, when Lupin had finished.\\n\\n\"Sire?\"\\n\\nBut, just as he was about to speak, shouts were heard in the gallery\\noutside.\\n\\nWaldemar left the room and returned:\\n\\n\"It\\'s the mad girl, Sire. They won\\'t let her pass.\"\\n\\n\"Let her come in.\" cried Lupin, eagerly. \"She must come in, Sire.\"\\n\\nAt a sign from the Emperor, Waldemar went out to fetch Isilda.\\n\\nHer entrance caused a general stupefaction. Her pale face was covered\\nwith dark blotches. Her distorted features bore signs of the keenest\\nsuffering. She panted for breath, with her two hands clutched against\\nher breast.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Lupin, struck with horror.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" asked the Emperor.\\n\\n\"Your doctor, Sire. There is not a moment to lose.\"\\n\\nHe went up to her:\\n\\n\"Speak, Isilda. . . . Have you seen anything? Have you anything to say?\"\\n\\nThe girl had stopped; her eyes were less vacant, as though lighted up by\\nthe pain. She uttered sounds. . . . but not a word.\\n\\n\"Listen,\" said Lupin. \"Answer yes or no . . . make a movement of the\\nhead . . . Have you seen him? Do you know where he is? . . . You know\\nwho he is. . . . Listen! if you don\\'t answer. . . .\"\\n\\nHe suppressed a gesture of anger. But, suddenly, remembering the\\nexperiment of the day before and that she seemed rather to have retained\\na certain optical memory of the time when she enjoyed her full reason,\\nhe wrote on the white wall a capital \"L\" and \"M.\"\\n\\nShe stretched out her arm toward the letters and nodded her head as\\nthough in assent.\\n\\n\"And then?\" said Lupin. \"What then? . . . Write something yourself.\"\\n\\nBut she gave a fearful scream and flung herself to the ground, yelling.\\n\\nThen, suddenly, came silence, immobility. One last convulsive spasm. And\\nshe moved no more.\\n\\n\"Dead?\" asked the Emperor.\\n\\n\"Poisoned, Sire.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, the poor thing! . . . And by whom?\"\\n\\n\"By \\'him,\\' Sire. She knew him, no doubt. He must have been afraid of\\nwhat she might tell.\"\\n\\nThe doctor arrived. The Emperor pointed to the girl. Then, addressing\\nWaldemar:\\n\\n\"All your men to turn out . . . Make them go through the houses . . .\\ntelegraph to the stations on the frontier. . . .\"\\n\\nHe went up to Lupin:\\n\\n\"How long do you want to recover the letters?\"\\n\\n\"A month, Sire . . . two months at most.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. Waldemar will wait for you here. He shall have my orders and\\nfull powers to grant you anything you wish.\"\\n\\n\"What I should like, Sire, is my freedom.\"\\n\\n\"You are free.\"\\n\\nLupin watched him walk away and said, between his teeth:\\n\\n\"My freedom first. . . . And afterward, when I have given you back the\\nletters, O Majesty, one little shake of the hand! Then we shall be\\nquits! . . .\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nTHE SEVEN SCOUNDRELS\\n\\n\\n\"Will you see this gentleman, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\nDolores Kesselbach took the card from the footman and read:\\n\\n\"André Beauny. . . . No,\" she said, \"I don\\'t know him.\"\\n\\n\"The gentleman seems very anxious to see you, ma\\'am. He says that you\\nare expecting him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh . . . possibly. . . . Yes, bring him here.\"\\n\\nSince the events which had upset her life and pursued her with\\nrelentless animosity, Dolores, after staying at the Hôtel Bristol had\\ntaken up her abode in a quiet house in the Rue des Vignes, down at\\nPassy. A pretty garden lay at the back of the house and was surrounded\\nby other leafy gardens. On days when attacks more painful than usual did\\nnot keep her from morning till night behind the closed shutters of her\\nbedroom, she made her servants carry her under the trees, where she lay\\nstretched at full length, a victim to melancholy, incapable of fighting\\nagainst her hard fate.\\n\\nFootsteps sounded on the gravel-path and the footman returned, followed\\nby a young man, smart in appearance and very simply dressed, in the\\nrather out-of-date fashion adopted by some of our painters, with a\\nturn-down collar and a flowing necktie of white spots on a blue ground.\\n\\nThe footman withdrew.\\n\\n\"Your name is André Beauny, I believe?\" said Dolores.\\n\\n\"Yes, madame.\"\\n\\n\"I have not the honor . . .\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, madame. Knowing that I was a friend of Mme.\\nErnemont, Geneviève\\'s grandmother, you wrote to her, at Garches, saying\\nthat you wished to speak to me. I have come.\"\\n\\nDolores rose in her seat, very excitedly:\\n\\n\"Oh, you are . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nShe stammered:\\n\\n\"Really? . . . Is it you? . . . I do not recognize you.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t recognize Prince Paul Sernine?\"\\n\\n\"No . . . everything is different . . . the forehead . . . the eyes.\\n. . . And that is not how the . . .\"\\n\\n\"How the newspapers represented the prisoner at the Santé?\" he said,\\nwith a smile. \"And yet it is I, really.\"\\n\\nA long silence followed, during which they remained embarrassed and ill\\nat ease.\\n\\nAt last, he asked:\\n\\n\"May I know the reason . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"Did not Geneviève tell you? . . .\"\\n\\n\"I have not seen her . . . but her grandmother seemed to think that you\\nrequired my services . . .\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right . . . that\\'s right. . . .\"\\n\\n\"And in what way . . . ? I am so pleased . . .\"\\n\\nShe hesitated a second and then whispered:\\n\\n\"I am afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Afraid?\" he cried.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said, speaking in a low voice, \"I am afraid, afraid of\\neverything, afraid of to-day and of to-morrow . . . and of the day after\\n. . . afraid of life. I have suffered so much. . . . I can bear no\\nmore.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her with great pity in his eyes. The vague feeling that had\\nalways drawn him to this woman took a more precise character now that\\nshe was asking for his protection. He felt an eager need to devote\\nhimself to her, wholly, without hope of reward.\\n\\nShe continued:\\n\\n\"I am alone now, quite alone, with servants whom I have picked up on\\nchance, and I am afraid. . . . I feel that people are moving about me.\"\\n\\n\"But with what object?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. But the enemy is hovering around and coming closer.\"\\n\\n\"Have you seen him? Have you noticed anything?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, the other day two men passed several times in the street and\\nstopped in front of the house.\"\\n\\n\"Can you describe them?\"\\n\\n\"I saw one of them better than the other. He was tall and powerful,\\nclean-shaven and wore a little black cloth jacket, cut quite short.\"\\n\\n\"A waiter at a café, perhaps?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a head-waiter. I had him followed by one of my servants. He went\\ndown the Rue de la Pompe and entered a common-looking house. The\\nground-floor is occupied by a wine-shop: it is the first house in the\\nstreet, on the left. Then, a night or two ago, I saw a shadow in the\\ngarden from my bedroom window.\"\\n\\n\"Is that all?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nHe thought and then made a suggestion:\\n\\n\"Would you allow two of my men to sleep downstairs, in one of the\\nground-floor rooms?\"\\n\\n\"Two of your men? . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you need not be afraid! They are decent men, old Charolais and his\\nson,[9] and they don\\'t look in the least like what they are. . . . You\\nwill be quite safe with them. . . . As for me . . .\"\\n\\n[Footnote 9: See _Arsène Lupin_, by Edgar Jepson and Maurice Leblanc.]\\n\\nHe hesitated. He was waiting for her to ask him to come again. As she\\nwas silent, he said:\\n\\n\"As for me, it is better that I should not be seen here. . . . Yes, it\\nis better . . . for your sake. My men will let me know how things go on.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nHe would have liked to say more and to remain and to sit down beside her\\nand comfort her. But he had a feeling that they had said all that they\\nhad to say and that a single word more, on his side, would be an insult.\\n\\nThen he made her a very low bow and went away.\\n\\nHe went up the garden, walking quickly, in his haste to be outside and\\nmaster his emotion. The footman was waiting for him at the hall-door. As\\nhe passed out into the street, somebody rang, a young woman.\\n\\nHe gave a start:\\n\\n\"Geneviève!\"\\n\\nShe fixed a pair of astonished eyes upon him and at once recognized him,\\nalthough bewildered by the extreme youthfulness of his appearance; and\\nthis gave her such a shock that she staggered and had to lean against\\nthe door for support. He had taken off his hat and was looking at her\\nwithout daring to put out his hand. Would she put out hers? He was no\\nlonger Prince Sernine: he was Arsène Lupin. And she knew that he was\\nArsène Lupin and that he had just come out of prison.\\n\\nIt was raining outside. She gave her umbrella to the footman and said:\\n\\n\"Please open it and put it somewhere to dry.\"\\n\\nThen she walked straight in.\\n\\n\"My poor old chap!\" said Lupin to himself, as he walked away. \"What a\\nseries of blows for a sensitive and highly-strung creature like\\nyourself! You must keep a watch on your heart or . . . Ah, what next?\\nHere are my eyes beginning to water now! That\\'s a bad sign. M. Lupin:\\nyou\\'re growing old!\"\\n\\nHe gave a tap on the shoulder to a young man who was crossing the\\nChaussee de la Muette and going toward the Rue des Vignes. The young man\\nstopped, stared at him and said:\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, monsieur, but I don\\'t think I have the honor . . .\"\\n\\n\"Think again, my dear M. Leduc. Or has your memory quite gone? Don\\'t you\\nremember Versailles? And the little room at the Hôtel des\\nTrois-Empereurs?\"\\n\\nThe young man bounded backwards:\\n\\n\"You!\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, I! Prince Sernine, or rather Lupin, since you know my real\\nname! Did you think that Lupin had departed this life? . . . Oh, yes, I\\nsee, prison. . . . You were hoping . . . Get out, you baby!\" He patted\\nhim gently on the shoulder. \"There, there, young fellow, don\\'t be\\nfrightened: you have still a few nice quiet days left to write your\\npoems in. The time has not yet come. Write your verses . . . poet!\"\\n\\nThen he gripped Leduc\\'s arm violently and, looking him full in the face,\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"But the time is drawing near . . . poet! Don\\'t forget that you belong\\nto me, body and soul. And prepare to play your part. It will be a hard\\nand magnificent part. And, as I live, I believe you\\'re the man to play\\nit!\"\\n\\nHe burst out laughing, turned on one foot and left young Leduc\\nastounded.\\n\\nA little further, at the corner of the Rue de la Pompe, stood the\\nwine-shop of which Mrs. Kesselbach had spoken to him. He went in and had\\na long talk with the proprietor.\\n\\nThen he took a taxi and drove to the Grand Hotel, where he was staying\\nunder the name of André Beauny, and found the brothers Doudeville\\nwaiting for him.\\n\\nLupin, though used to that sort of pleasure, nevertheless enjoyed the\\nmarks of admiration and devotion with which his friends overwhelmed him:\\n\\n\"But, governor, tell us . . . what happened? We\\'re accustomed to all\\nsorts of wonders with you; but still, there are limits. . . . So you are\\nfree? And here you are, in the heart of Paris, scarcely disguised.\\n. . . !\"\\n\\n\"Have a cigar,\" said Lupin.\\n\\n\"Thank you, no.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re wrong, Doudeville. These are worth smoking. I have them from a\\ngreat connoisseur, who is good enough to call himself my friend.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, may one ask . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"The Kaiser! Come, don\\'t look so flabbergasted, the two of you! And tell\\nme things: I haven\\'t seen the papers. What effect did my escape have on\\nthe public?\"\\n\\n\"Tremendous, governor!\"\\n\\n\"What was the police version?\"\\n\\n\"Your flight took place at Garches, during an attempt to reënact the\\nmurder of Altenheim. Unfortunately, the journalists have proved that it\\nwas impossible.\"\\n\\n\"After that?\"\\n\\n\"After that, a general fluster. People wondering, laughing and enjoying\\nthemselves like mad.\"\\n\\n\"Weber?\"\\n\\n\"Weber is badly let in.\"\\n\\n\"Apart from that, no news at the detective-office? Nothing discovered\\nabout the murderer? No clue to help us to establish Altenheim\\'s\\nidentity?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"What fools they are! And to think that we pay millions a year to keep\\nthose people. If this sort of thing goes on, I shall refuse to pay my\\nrates. Take a seat and a pen. I will dictate a letter which you must\\nhand in to the _Grand Journal_ this evening. The world has been waiting\\nfor news of me long enough. It must be gasping with impatience. Write.\"\\n\\nHe dictated:\\n\\n      \"To the Editor of the _Grand Journal_:\\n\\n      \"SIR,\\n\\n      \"I must apologize to your readers for disappointing\\n      their legitimate impatience.\\n\\n      \"I have escaped from prison and I cannot possibly\\n      reveal how I escaped. In the same way, since my\\n      escape, I have discovered the famous secret and I\\n      cannot possibly disclose what the secret is nor how I\\n      discovered it.\\n\\n      \"All this will, some day or other, form the subject\\n      of a rather original story which my\\n      biographer-in-ordinary will publish from my notes. It\\n      will form a page of the history of France which our\\n      grandchildren will read with interest.\\n\\n      \"For the moment, I have more important matters to\\n      attend to. Disgusted at seeing into what hands the\\n      functions which I once exercised have fallen, tired of\\n      finding the Kesselbach-Altenheim case still dragging\\n      along, I am discharging M. Weber and resuming the post\\n      of honor which I occupied with such distinction and to\\n      the general satisfaction under the name of M.\\n      Lenormand.\\n\\n        \"I am, Sir,\\n                       \"Your obedient servant.\\n                                    \"ARSÈNE LUPIN,\\n                   \"_Chief of the Detective-service_.\"\\n\\nAt eight o\\'clock in the evening, Arsène Lupin and Jean Doudeville walked\\ninto Caillard\\'s, the fashionable restaurant, Lupin in evening-clothes,\\nbut dressed like an artist, with rather wide trousers and a rather loose\\ntie, and Doudeville in a frock-coat, with the serious air and appearance\\nof a magistrate.\\n\\nThey sat down in that part of the restaurant which is set back and\\ndivided from the big room by two columns.\\n\\nA head-waiter, perfectly dressed and supercilious in manner, came to\\ntake their orders, note-book in hand. Lupin selected the dinner with the\\nnice thought of an accomplished epicure:\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" he said, \"the prison ordinary was quite acceptable; but,\\nall the same, it is nice to have a carefully-ordered meal.\"\\n\\nHe ate with a good appetite and silently, contenting himself with\\nuttering, from time to time, a short sentence that marked his train of\\nthought:\\n\\n\"Of course, I shall manage . . . but it will be a hard job. . . . Such\\nan adversary! . . . What staggers me is that, after six months\\'\\nfighting, I don\\'t even know what he wants! . . . His chief accomplice is\\ndead, we are near the end of the battle and yet, even now, I can\\'t\\nunderstand his game. . . . What is the wretch after? . . . My own plan\\nis quite clear: to lay hands on the grand-duchy, to shove a grand-duke\\nof my own making on the throne, to give him Geneviève for a wife . . .\\nand to reign. That is what I call lucid, honest and fair. But he, the\\nlow fellow, the ghost in the dark: what is he aiming at?\"\\n\\nHe called:\\n\\n\"Waiter!\"\\n\\nThe head-waiter came up:\\n\\n\"Yes, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Cigars.\"\\n\\nThe head-waiter stalked away, returned and opened a number of boxes.\\n\\n\"Which do you recommend?\"\\n\\n\"These Upmanns are very good, sir.\"\\n\\nLupin gave Doudeville an Upmann, took one for himself and cut it. The\\nhead-waiter struck a match and held if for him. With a sudden movement,\\nLupin caught him by the wrist:\\n\\n\"Not a word. . . . I know you. . . . Your real name is Dominique Lecas!\"\\n\\nThe man, who was big and strong, tried to struggle away. He stifled a\\ncry of pain: Lupin had twisted his wrist.\\n\\n\"Your name is Dominique . . . you live in the Rue de la Pompe, on the\\nfourth floor, where you retired with a small fortune acquired in the\\nservice--listen to me, you fool, will you, or I\\'ll break every bone in\\nyour body!--acquired in the service of Baron Altenheim, at whose house\\nyou were butler.\"\\n\\nThe other stood motionless, his face pallid with fear. Around them, the\\nsmall room was empty. In the restaurant beside it, three gentlemen sat\\nsmoking and two couples were chatting over their liquors.\\n\\n\"You see, we are quiet . . . we can talk.\"\\n\\n\"Who are you? Who are you?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you recollect me? Why, think of that famous luncheon in the Villa\\nDupont! . . . You yourself, you old flunkey, handed me the plate of\\ncakes . . . and such cakes!\"\\n\\n\"Prince. . . . Prince. . . .\" stammered the other.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, Prince Arsène, Prince Lupin in person. . . . Aha, you breathe\\nagain! . . . You\\'re saying to yourself that you have nothing to fear\\nfrom Lupin, isn\\'t that it? Well, you\\'re wrong, old chap, you have\\neverything to fear.\" He took a card from his pocket and showed it to\\nhim. \"There, look, I belong to the police now. Can\\'t be helped: that\\'s\\nwhat we all come to in the end, all of us robber-kings and emperors of\\ncrime.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\" said the head-waiter, still greatly alarmed.\\n\\n\"Well, go to that customer over there, who\\'s calling you, get him what\\nhe wants and come back to me. And no nonsense, mind you: don\\'t go trying\\nto get away. I have ten men outside, with orders to keep their eyes on\\nyou. Be off.\"\\n\\nThe head-waiter obeyed. Five minutes after, he returned and, standing in\\nfront of the table, with his back to the restaurant, as though\\ndiscussing the quality of the cigars with his customers, he said:\\n\\n\"Well? What is it?\"\\n\\nLupin laid a number of hundred-franc notes in a row on the table:\\n\\n\"One note for each definite answer to my questions.\"\\n\\n\"Done!\"\\n\\n\"Now then. How many of you were there with Baron Altenheim?\"\\n\\n\"Seven, without counting myself.\"\\n\\n\"No more?\"\\n\\n\"No. Once only, we picked up some workmen in Italy to make the\\nunderground passage from the Villa des Glycines, at Garches.\"\\n\\n\"Were there two underground passages?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, one led to the Pavillon Hortense and the other branched off from\\nthe first and ran under Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s house.\"\\n\\n\"What was the object?\"\\n\\n\"To carry off Mrs. Kesselbach.\"\\n\\n\"Were the two maids, Suzanne and Gertrude, accomplices?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Where are they?\"\\n\\n\"Abroad.\"\\n\\n\"And your seven pals, those of the Altenheim gang?\"\\n\\n\"I have left them. They are still going on.\"\\n\\n\"Where can I find them?\"\\n\\nDominique hesitated. Lupin unfolded two notes of a thousand francs each\\nand said:\\n\\n\"Your scruples do you honor, Dominique. There\\'s nothing for it but to\\nswallow them like a man and answer.\"\\n\\nDominique replied:\\n\\n\"You will find them at No. 3, Route de la Revolte, Neuilly. One of them\\nis called the Broker.\"\\n\\n\"Capital. And now the name, the real name of Altenheim. Do you know it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Ribeira.\"\\n\\n\"Dominique, Dominique, you\\'re asking for trouble. Ribeira was only an\\nassumed name. I asked you the real name.\"\\n\\n\"Parbury.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s another assumed name.\"\\n\\nThe head-waiter hesitated. Lupin unfolded three hundred franc notes.\\n\\n\"Pshaw, what do I care!\" said the man. \"After all, he\\'s dead, isn\\'t he?\\nQuite dead.\"\\n\\n\"His name,\" said Lupin.\\n\\n\"His name? The Chevalier de Malreich.\"\\n\\nLupin gave a jump in his chair:\\n\\n\"What? What do you say? The Chevalier--say it again--the Chevalier\\n. . . ?\"\\n\\n\"Raoul de Malreich.\"\\n\\nA long pause. Lupin, with his eyes fixed before him, thought of the mad\\ngirl at Veldenz, who had died by poison: Isilda bore the same name,\\nMalreich. And it was the name borne by the small French noble who came\\nto the court of Veldenz in the eighteenth century.\\n\\nHe resumed his questions:\\n\\n\"What country did this Malreich belong to?\"\\n\\n\"He was of French origin, but born in Germany . . . I saw some papers\\nonce . . . that was how I came to know his name. . . . Oh, if he had\\nfound it out, he would have wrung my neck, I believe!\"\\n\\nLupin reflected and said:\\n\\n\"Did he command the lot of you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But he had an accomplice, a partner?\"\\n\\n\"Oh hush . . . hush . . . !\"\\n\\nThe head-waiter\\'s face suddenly expressed the most intense alarm. Lupin\\nnoticed the same sort of terror and repulsion which he himself felt when\\nhe thought of the murderer.\\n\\n\"Who is he? Have you seen him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t let us talk of that one . . . it doesn\\'t do to talk of him.\"\\n\\n\"Who is he, I\\'m asking you.\"\\n\\n\"He is the master . . . the chief. . . . Nobody knows him.\"\\n\\n\"But you\\'ve seen him, you. Answer me. Have you seen him?\"\\n\\n\"Sometimes, in the dark . . . at night. Never by daylight. His orders\\ncome on little scraps of paper . . . or by telephone.\"\\n\\n\"His name?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know it. We never used to speak of him. It was unlucky.\"\\n\\n\"He dresses in black, doesn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, in black. He is short and slender . . . with fair hair. . . .\"\\n\\n\"And he kills, doesn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he kills . . . he kills where another might steal a bit of bread.\"\\n\\nHis voice shook. He entreated:\\n\\n\"Let us stop this . . . it won\\'t do to talk of him. . . . I tell you\\n. . . it\\'s unlucky.\"\\n\\nLupin was silent, impressed, in spite of himself, by the man\\'s anguish.\\nHe sat long thinking and then rose and said to the head-waiter:\\n\\n\"Here, here\\'s your money; but, if you want to live in peace, you will do\\nwell not to breathe a word of our conversation to anybody.\"\\n\\nHe left the restaurant with Doudeville and walked to the Porte\\nSaint-Denis without speaking, absorbed in all that he had heard. At\\nlast, he seized his companion\\'s arm and said:\\n\\n\"Listen to me, Doudeville, carefully. Go to the Gare du Nord. You will\\nget there in time to catch the Luxemburg express. Go to Veldenz, the\\ncapital of the grand-duchy of Zweibrucken-Veldenz. At the town-hall, you\\nwill easily obtain the birth-certificate of the Chevalier de Malreich\\nand further information about the family. You will be back on the day\\nafter to-morrow: that will be Saturday.\"\\n\\n\"Am I to let them know at the detective-office?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll see to that. I shall telephone that you are ill. Oh, one word\\nmore: on Saturday, meet me at twelve o\\'clock in a little café on the\\nRoute de la Revolte, called the Restaurant Buffalo. Come dressed as a\\nworkman.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe next day, Lupin, wearing a short smock and a cap, went down to\\nNeuilly and began his investigations at No. 3, Route de la Revolte. A\\ngateway opened into an outer yard; and here he found a huge block of\\nworkmen\\'s dwellings, a whole series of passages and workshops, with a\\nswarming population of artisans, women and brats. In a few minutes, he\\nhad won the good-will of the portress, with whom he chatted for an hour\\non the most varied topics. During this hour, he saw three men pass, one\\nafter the other, whose manner struck him:\\n\\n\"That\\'s game,\" he thought, \"and gamy game at that! . . . They follow one\\nanother by scent! . . . Look quite respectable, of course, but with the\\neye of the hunted deer which knows that the enemy is all around and that\\nevery tuft, every blade of grass may conceal an ambush.\"\\n\\nThat afternoon and on the Saturday morning, he pursued his inquiries and\\nmade certain that Altenheim\\'s seven accomplices all lived on the\\npremises. Four of them openly followed the trade of second-hand\\nclothes-dealers. Two of the others sold newspapers; and the third\\ndescribed himself as a broker and was nicknamed accordingly.\\n\\nThey went in and out, one after the other, without appearing to know one\\nanother. But, in the evening, Lupin discovered that they met in a sort\\nof coach-house situated right at the back of the last of the yards, a\\nplace in which the Broker kept his wares piled up: old iron, broken\\nkitchen-ranges, rusty stove-pipes . . . and also, no doubt, the best\\npart of the stolen goods.\\n\\n\"Come,\" he said, \"the work is shaping nicely. I asked my cousin of\\nGermany for a month and I believe a fortnight will be enough for my\\npurpose. And what I like about it is that I shall start operations with\\nthe scoundrels who made me take a header in the Seine. My poor old\\nGourel, I shall revenge you at last. And high time too!\"\\n\\nAt twelve o\\'clock on Saturday, he went to the Restaurant Buffalo, a\\nlittle low-ceilinged room to which brick-layers and cab-drivers resorted\\nfor their mid-day meal. Some one came and sat down beside him:\\n\\n\"It\\'s done, governor.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, is it you, Doudeville? That\\'s right! I\\'m dying to know. Have you\\nthe particulars? The birth-certificate? Quick, tell me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s like this: Altenheim\\'s father and mother died abroad.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind about them.\"\\n\\n\"They left three children.\"\\n\\n\"Three?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. The eldest would have been thirty years old by now. His name was\\nRaoul de Malreich.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s our man, Altenheim. Next?\"\\n\\n\"The youngest of the children was a girl, Isilda. The register has an\\nentry, in fresh ink, \\'Deceased.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Isilda. . . . Isilda,\" repeated Lupin. \"That\\'s just what I thought:\\nIsilda was Altenheim\\'s sister. . . . I saw a look in her face which I\\nseemed to recognize. . . . So that was the link between them. . . . But\\nthe other, the third child, or rather the second?\"\\n\\n\"A son. He would be twenty-six by now.\"\\n\\n\"His name?\"\\n\\n\"Louis de Malreich.\"\\n\\nLupin gave a little start:\\n\\n\"That\\'s it! Louis de Malreich. . . . The initials L. M. . . . The awful\\nand terrifying signature! . . . The murderer\\'s name is Louis de\\nMalreich. . . . He was the brother of Altenheim and the brother of\\nIsilda and he killed both of them for fear of what they might reveal.\"\\n\\nLupin sat long, silent and gloomy, under the obsession, no doubt, of the\\nmysterious being.\\n\\nDoudeville objected:\\n\\n\"What had he to fear from his sister Isilda? She was mad, they told me.\"\\n\\n\"Mad, yes, but capable of remembering certain details of her childhood.\\nShe must have recognized the brother with whom she grew up . . . and\\nthat recollection cost her her life.\" And he added, \"Mad! But all those\\npeople were mad. . . . The mother was mad. . . . The father a\\ndipsomaniac. . . . Altenheim a regular brute beast. . . . Isilda, a poor\\ninnocent . . . . As for the other, the murderer, he is the monster, the\\ncrazy lunatic. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Crazy? Do you think so, governor?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, crazy! With flashes of genius, of devilish cunning and intuition,\\nbut a crack-brained fool, a madman, like all that Malreich family. Only\\nmadmen kill and especially madmen of his stamp. For, after all . . .\"\\n\\nHe interrupted himself; and his face underwent so great a change that\\nDoudeville was struck by it:\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter, governor?\"\\n\\n\"Look.\"\\n\\nA man had entered and hung his hat--a soft, black felt hat--on a peg. He\\nsat down at a little table, examined the bill of fare which a waiter\\nbrought him, gave his order and waited motionless, with his body stiff\\nand erect and his two arms crossed over the table-cloth.\\n\\nAnd Lupin saw him full-face.\\n\\nHe had a lean, hard visage, absolutely smooth and pierced with two\\nsockets in the depths of which appeared a pair of steel-gray eyes. The\\nskin seemed stretched from bone to bone, like a sheet of parchment, so\\nstiff and so thick that not a hair could have penetrated through it.\\n\\nAnd the face was dismal and dull. No expression enlivened it. No thought\\nseemed to abide under that ivory forehead; and the eye-lids, entirely\\ndevoid of lashes, never flickered, which gave the eyes the fixed look\\nof the eyes in a statue.\\n\\nLupin beckoned to one of the waiters:\\n\\n\"Who is that gentleman?\"\\n\\n\"The one eating his lunch over there?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"He is a customer. He comes here two or three times a week.\"\\n\\n\"Can you tell me his name?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes . . . Leon Massier.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" blurted Lupin, very excitedly. \"L. M. . . . the same two letters\\n. . . could it be Louis de Malreich?\"\\n\\nHe watched him eagerly. Indeed, the man\\'s appearance agreed with Lupin\\'s\\nconjectures, with what he knew of him and of his hideous mode of\\nexistence. But what puzzled him was that look of death about him: where\\nhe anticipated life and fire, where he would have expected to find the\\ntorment, the disorder, the violent facial distortion of the great\\naccursed, he beheld sheer impassiveness.\\n\\nHe asked the waiter:\\n\\n\"What does he do?\"\\n\\n\"I really can\\'t say. He\\'s a rum cove . . . He\\'s always quite alone.\\n. . . He never talks to anybody . . . We here don\\'t even know the sound\\nof his voice. . . . He points his finger at the dishes on the bill of\\nfare which he wants. . . . He has finished in twenty minutes; then he\\npays and goes. . . .\"\\n\\n\"And he comes back again?\"\\n\\n\"Every three or four days. He\\'s not regular.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s he, it cannot be any one else,\" said Lupin to himself. \"It\\'s\\nMalreich. There he is . . . breathing . . . at four steps from me. There\\nare the hands that kill. There is the brain that gloats upon the smell\\nof blood. There is the monster, the vampire! . . .\"\\n\\nAnd, yet, was it possible? Lupin had ended by looking upon Malreich as\\nso fantastic a being that he was disconcerted at seeing him in the\\nflesh, coming, going, moving. He could not explain to himself how the\\nman could eat bread and meat like other men, drink beer like any one\\nelse: this man whom he had pictured as a foul beast, feeding on live\\nflesh and sucking the blood of his victims.\\n\\n\"Come away, Doudeville.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you, governor? You look quite white!\"\\n\\n\"I want air. Come out.\"\\n\\nOutside, he drew a deep breath, wiped the perspiration from his forehead\\nand muttered:\\n\\n\"That\\'s better. I was stifling.\" And, mastering himself, he added, \"Now\\nwe must play our game cautiously and not lose sight of his tracks.\"\\n\\n\"Hadn\\'t we better separate, governor? Our man saw us together. He will\\ntake less notice of us singly.\"\\n\\n\"Did he see us?\" said Lupin, pensively. \"He seems to me to see nothing,\\nto hear nothing and to look at nothing. What a bewildering specimen!\"\\n\\nAnd, in fact, ten minutes later, Leon Massier appeared and walked away,\\nwithout even looking to see if he was followed. He had lit a cigarette\\nand smoked, with one of his hands behind his back, strolling along like\\na saunterer enjoying the sunshine and the fresh air and never suspecting\\nthat his movements could possibly be watched.\\n\\nHe passed through the toll-gates, skirted the fortifications, went out\\nagain through the Porte Champerret and retraced his steps along the\\nRoute de la Revolte.\\n\\nWould he enter the buildings at No. 3? Lupin eagerly hoped that he\\nwould, for that would have been a certain proof of his complicity with\\nthe Altenheim gang; but the man turned round and made for the Rue\\nDelaizement, which he followed until he passed the Velodrome Buffalo.\\n\\nOn the left, opposite the cycling-track, between the public tennis-court\\nand the booths that line the Rue Delaizement, stood a small detached\\nvilla, surrounded by a scanty garden. Leon Massier stopped, took out his\\nkeys, opened first the gate of the garden and then the door of the house\\nand disappeared.\\n\\nLupin crept forward cautiously. He at once noticed that the block in the\\nRoute de la Revolte stretched back as far as the garden-wall. Coming\\nstill nearer, he saw that the wall was very high and that a coach-house\\nrested against it at the bottom of the garden. The position of the\\nbuildings was such as to give him the certainty that his coach-house\\nstood back to back with the coach-house in the inner yard of No. 3,\\nwhich served as a lumber-room for the Broker.\\n\\nLeon Massier, therefore, occupied a house adjoining the place in which\\nthe seven members of the Altenheim gang held their meetings.\\nConsequently, Leon Massier was, in point of fact, the supreme leader who\\ncommanded that gang; and there was evidently a passage between the two\\ncoach-houses through which he communicated with his followers.\\n\\n\"I was right,\" said Lupin. \"Leon Massier and Louis de Malreich are one\\nand the same man. The situation is much simpler than it was.\"\\n\\n\"There is no doubt about that,\" said Doudeville, \"and everything will be\\nsettled in a few days.\"\\n\\n\"That is to say, I shall have been stabbed in the throat.\"\\n\\n\"What are you saying, governor? There\\'s an idea!\"\\n\\n\"Pooh, who knows? I have always had a presentiment that that monster\\nwould bring me ill-luck.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThenceforth it became a matter of watching Malreich\\'s life in such a way\\nthat none of his movements went unobserved. This life was of the oddest,\\nif one could believe the people of the neighborhood whom Doudeville\\nquestioned. \"The bloke from the villa,\" as they called him, had been\\nliving there for a few months only. He saw and received nobody. He was\\nnot known to keep a servant of any kind. And the windows, though they\\nwere left wide open, even at night, always remained dark and were never\\nlit with the glow of a lamp or candle.\\n\\nMoreover, Leon Massier most often went out at the close of day and did\\nnot come in again until very late . . . at dawn, said people who had\\ncome upon him at sunrise.\\n\\n\"And does any one know what he does?\" asked Lupin of his companion, when\\nthey next met.\\n\\n\"No, he leads an absolutely irregular existence. He sometimes disappears\\nfor several days together . . . or, rather, he remains indoors. When all\\nis said, nobody knows anything.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we shall know; and that soon.\"\\n\\nHe was wrong. After a week of continuous efforts and investigations, he\\nhad learnt no more than before about that strange individual. The\\nextraordinary thing that constantly happened was this, that, suddenly,\\nwhile Lupin was following him, the man, who was ambling with short steps\\nalong the streets, without ever turning round or ever stopping, the man\\nwould vanish as if by a miracle. True, he sometimes went through houses\\nwith two entrances. But, at other times, he seemed to fade away in the\\nmidst of the crowd, like a ghost. And Lupin was left behind, petrified,\\nastounded, filled with rage and confusion.\\n\\nHe at once hurried to the Rue Delaizement and stood on guard outside the\\nvilla. Minutes followed upon minutes, half-hour upon half-hour. A part\\nof the night slipped away. Then, suddenly, the mysterious man hove in\\nsight. What could he have been doing?\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"An express message for you, governor,\" said Doudeville, at eight\\no\\'clock one evening, as he joined him in the Rue Delaizement.\\n\\nLupin opened the envelope. Mrs. Kesselbach implored him to come to her\\naid. It appeared that two men had taken up their stand under her\\nwindows, at night, and one of them had said:\\n\\n\"What luck, we\\'ve dazzled them completely this time! So it\\'s understood;\\nwe shall strike the blow to-night.\"\\n\\nMrs. Kesselbach thereupon went downstairs and discovered that the\\nshutter in the pantry did not fasten, or, at least, that it could be\\nopened from the outside.\\n\\n\"At last,\" said Lupin, \"it\\'s the enemy himself who offers to give\\nbattle. That\\'s a good thing! I am tired of marching up and down under\\nMalreich\\'s windows.\"\\n\\n\"Is he there at this moment?\"\\n\\n\"No, he played me one of his tricks again in Paris, just as I was about\\nto play him one of mine. But, first of all, listen to me, Doudeville. Go\\nand collect ten of our men and bring them to the Rue des Vignes. Look\\nhere, bring Marco and Jérôme, the messenger. I have given them a holiday\\nsince the business at the Palace Hotel: let them come this time. Daddy\\nCharolais and his son ought to be mounting guard by now. Make your\\narrangements with them, and at half-past eleven, come and join me at the\\ncorner of the Rue des Vignes and the Rue Raynouard. From there we will\\nwatch the house.\"\\n\\nDoudeville went away. Lupin waited for an hour longer, until that quiet\\nthoroughfare, the Rue Delaizement, was quite deserted, and then, seeing\\nthat Leon Massier did not return, he made up his mind and went up to the\\nvilla.\\n\\nThere was no one in sight. . . . He took a run and jumped on the stone\\nledge that supported the railings of the garden. A few minutes later, he\\nwas inside.\\n\\nHis plan was to force the door of the house and search the rooms in\\norder to find the Emperor\\'s letters which Malreich had stolen from\\nVeldenz. But he thought a visit to the coach-house of more immediate\\nimportance.\\n\\nHe was much surprised to see that it was open and, next, to find, by the\\nlight of his electric lantern, that it was absolutely empty and that\\nthere was no door in the back wall. He hunted about for a long time, but\\nmet with no more success. Outside, however, he saw a ladder standing\\nagainst the coach-house and obviously serving as a means of reaching a\\nsort of loft contrived under the slate roof.\\n\\nThe loft was blocked with old packing-cases, trusses of straw and\\ngardener\\'s frames, or rather it seemed to be blocked, for he very soon\\ndiscovered a gangway that took him to the wall. Here, he knocked up\\nagainst a cucumber-frame, which he tried to move. Failing to effect his\\npurpose, he examined the frame more closely and found, first, that it\\nwas fixed to the wall and, secondly, that one of the panes was missing.\\nHe passed his arm through and encountered space. He cast the bright\\nlight of the lantern through the aperture and saw a big shed, a\\ncoach-house larger than that of the villa and filled with old iron-work\\nand objects of every kind.\\n\\n\"That\\'s it,\" said Lupin to himself. \"This window has been contrived in\\nthe Broker\\'s lumber-room, right up at the top, and from here Louis de\\nMalreich sees, hears and watches his accomplices, without being seen or\\nheard by them. I now understand how it is that they do not know their\\nleader.\"\\n\\nHaving found out what he wanted, he put out his light and was on the\\npoint of leaving, when a door opened opposite him, down below. Some one\\ncame in and lit a lamp. He recognized the Broker. He thereupon resolved\\nto stay where he was, since the expedition, after all, could not be done\\nso long as that man was there.\\n\\nThe Broker took two revolvers from his pocket. He tested the triggers\\nand changed the cartridges, whistling a music-hall tune as he did so.\\n\\nAn hour elapsed in this way. Lupin was beginning to grow restless,\\nwithout, however, making up his mind to go.\\n\\nMore minutes passed, half an hour, an hour. . . .\\n\\nAt last, the man said aloud:\\n\\n\"Come in.\"\\n\\nOne of the scoundrels slipped into the shed; and, one after the other, a\\nthird arrived and a fourth. . . .\\n\\n\"We are all here,\" said the Broker. \"Dieudonne and Chubby will meet us\\ndown there. Come, we\\'ve no time to lose. . . . Are you armed?\"\\n\\n\"To the teeth.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right. It\\'ll be hot work.\"\\n\\n\"How do you know, Broker?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve seen the chief. . . . When I say that I\\'ve seen him, no . . . but\\nhe spoke to me. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said one of the men, \"in the dark, at a street-corner, as usual.\\nAh, Altenheim\\'s ways were better than that. At least, one knew what one\\nwas doing.\"\\n\\n\"And don\\'t you know?\" retorted the Broker. \"We\\'re breaking in at the\\nKesselbach woman\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"And what about the two watchers? The two coves whom Lupin posted\\nthere?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s their look-out: there\\'s seven of us. They had better give us as\\nlittle trouble as possible.\"\\n\\n\"What about the Kesselbach?\"\\n\\n\"Gag her first, then bind her and bring her here. . . . There, on that\\nold sofa. . . . And then wait for orders.\"\\n\\n\"Is the job well paid?\"\\n\\n\"The Kesselbach\\'s jewels to begin with.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, if it comes off . . . but I\\'m speaking of the certainty.\"\\n\\n\"Three hundred-franc notes apiece, beforehand, and twice as much again\\nafterwards.\"\\n\\n\"Have you the money?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right. You can say what you like, but, as far as paying\\ngoes, there\\'s no one to equal that bloke.\" And, in a voice so low that\\nLupin could hardly hear, \"I say, Broker, if we\\'re obliged to use the\\nknife, is there a reward?\"\\n\\n\"The same as usual, two thousand.\"\\n\\n\"If it\\'s Lupin?\"\\n\\n\"Three thousand.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, if we could only get him!\"\\n\\nOne after the other, they left the lumber-room. Lupin heard the Broker\\'s\\nparting words:\\n\\n\"This is the plan of attack. We divide into three lots. A whistle; and\\nevery one runs forward. . . .\"\\n\\nLupin hurriedly left his hiding-place, went down the ladder, ran round\\nthe house, without going in, and climbed back over the railings:\\n\\n\"The Broker\\'s right; it\\'ll be hot work. . . . Ah, it\\'s my skin they\\'re\\nafter! A reward for Lupin! The rascals!\"\\n\\nHe passed through the toll-gate and jumped into a taxi:\\n\\n\"Rue Raynouard.\"\\n\\nHe stopped the cab at two hundred yards from the Rue des Vignes and\\nwalked to the corner of the two streets. To his great surprise,\\nDoudeville was not there.\\n\\n\"That\\'s funny,\" said Lupin. \"It\\'s past twelve. . . . This business looks\\nsuspicious to me.\"\\n\\nHe waited ten minutes, twenty minutes. At half-past twelve, nobody had\\narrived. Further delay was dangerous. After all, if Doudeville and his\\nmen were prevented from coming, Charolais, his son and he, Lupin,\\nhimself were enough to repel the attack, without counting the assistance\\nof the servants.\\n\\nHe therefore went ahead. But he caught sight of two men who tried to\\nhide in the shadow of a corner wall.\\n\\n\"Hang it!\" he said. \"That\\'s the vanguard of the gang, Dieudonne and\\nChubby. I\\'ve allowed myself to be out-distanced, like a fool.\"\\n\\nHere he lost more time. Should he go straight up to them, disable them\\nand then climb into the house through the pantry-window, which he knew\\nto be unlocked? That would be the most prudent course and would enable\\nhim, moreover, to take Mrs. Kesselbach away at once and to remove her to\\na place of safety.\\n\\nYes, but it also meant the failure of his plan; it meant missing this\\nglorious opportunity of trapping the whole gang, including Louis de\\nMalreich himself, without doubt.\\n\\nSuddenly a whistle sounded from somewhere on the other side of the\\nhouse. Was it the rest of the gang, so soon? And was an offensive\\nmovement to be made from the garden?\\n\\nBut, at the preconcerted signal, the two men climbed through the window\\nand disappeared from view.\\n\\nLupin scaled the balcony at a bound and jumped into the pantry. By the\\nsound of their footsteps, he judged that the assailants had gone into\\nthe garden; and the sound was so distinct that he felt easy in his mind:\\nCharolais and his son could not fail to hear the noise.\\n\\nHe therefore went upstairs. Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s bedroom was on the first\\nlanding. He walked in without knocking.\\n\\nA night-light was burning in the room; and he saw Dolores, on a sofa,\\nfainting. He ran up to her, lifted her and, in a voice of command,\\nforcing her to answer:\\n\\n\"Listen. . . . Charolais? His son . . . Where are they?\"\\n\\nShe stammered:\\n\\n\"Why, what do you mean? . . . They\\'re gone, of course! . . .\"\\n\\n\"What, gone?\"\\n\\n\"You sent me word . . . an hour ago . . . a telephone-message. . . .\"\\n\\nHe picked up a piece of blue paper lying beside her and read:\\n\\n      \"Send the two watchers away at once . . . and all my\\n      men. . . . Tell them to meet me at the Grand Hotel.\\n      Have no fear.\"\\n\\n\"Thunder! And you believed it? . . . But your servants?\"\\n\\n\"Gone.\"\\n\\nHe went up to the window. Outside, three men were coming from the other\\nend of the garden.\\n\\nFrom the window in the next room, which looked out on the street, he saw\\ntwo others, on the pavement.\\n\\nAnd he thought of Dieudonne, of Chubby, of Louis de Malreich, above all,\\nwho must now be prowling around, invisible and formidable.\\n\\n\"Hang it!\" he muttered. \"I half believe they\\'ve done me this time!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nTHE MAN IN BLACK\\n\\n\\nAt that moment, Arsène Lupin felt the impression, the certainty, that he\\nhad been drawn into an ambush, by means which he had not the time to\\nperceive, but of which he guessed the prodigious skill and address.\\nEverything had been calculated, everything ordained; the dismissal of\\nhis men, the disappearance or treachery of the servants, his own\\npresence in Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s house.\\n\\nClearly, the whole thing had succeeded, exactly as the enemy wished,\\nthanks to circumstances almost miraculously fortunate; for, after all,\\nhe might have arrived before the false message had sent his friends\\naway. But then there would have been a battle between his own gang and\\nthe Altenheim gang. And Lupin, remembering Malreich\\'s conduct, the\\nmurder of Altenheim, the poisoning of the mad girl at Veldenz, Lupin\\nasked himself whether the ambush was aimed at him alone or whether\\nMalreich had not contemplated the possibility of a general scuffle,\\ninvolving the killing of accomplices who had by this time become irksome\\nto him.\\n\\nIt was an intuition, rather, a fleeting idea, that just passed through\\nhis mind. The hour was one for action. He must defend Dolores, the\\nabduction of whom was, in all likelihood, the first and foremost reason\\nof the attack.\\n\\nHe half-opened the casement window on the street and levelled his\\nrevolver. A shot, rousing and alarming the neighborhood, and the\\nscoundrels would take to their heels.\\n\\n\"Well, no,\" he muttered, \"no! It shall not be said that I shirked the\\nfight. The opportunity is too good. . . . And, then, who says that they\\nwould run away! . . . There are too many of them to care about the\\nneighbors.\"\\n\\nHe returned to Dolores\\' room. There was a noise downstairs. He listened\\nand, finding that it came from the staircase, he locked the door.\\n\\nDolores was crying and throwing herself about the sofa.\\n\\nHe implored her:\\n\\n\"Are you strong enough? We are on the first floor. I could help you\\ndown. We can lower the sheets from the window. . . .\"\\n\\n\"No, no, don\\'t leave me. . . . I am frightened. . . . I haven\\'t the\\nstrength . . . they will kill me. . . . Oh, protect me!\"\\n\\nHe took her in his arms and carried her to the next room. And, bending\\nover her:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t move; and keep calm. I swear to you that not one of those men\\nshall touch you, as long as I am alive.\"\\n\\nThe door of the first room was tried. Dolores, clinging to him with all\\nher might, cried:\\n\\n\"Oh, there they are! There they are! . . . They will kill you . . . you\\nare alone! . . .\"\\n\\nEagerly, he said:\\n\\n\"No, I am not alone. . . . You are here. . . . You are here beside me.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nHe tried to release himself. She took his head in her two hands, looked\\nhim deep in the eyes and whispered:\\n\\n\"Where are you going? What are you going to do? No . . . you must not\\ndie. . . . I won\\'t have it . . . you must live . . . you must.\"\\n\\nShe stammered words which he did not catch and which she seemed to\\nstifle between her lips lest he should hear them; and, having spent all\\nher energy, exhausted, she fell back unconscious.\\n\\nHe leant over her and gazed at her for a moment. Softly, lightly, he\\npressed a kiss upon her hair.\\n\\nThen he went back to the first room, carefully closed the door between\\nthe two and switched on the electric light.\\n\\n\"One second, my lads!\" he cried. \"You seem in a great hurry to get\\nyourselves smashed to pieces! . . . Don\\'t you know that Lupin\\'s here?\\nI\\'ll make you dance!\"\\n\\nWhile speaking, he unfolded a screen in such a way as to hide the sofa\\non which Mrs. Kesselbach had been lying; and he now spread dresses and\\ncoverings over it. The door was on the point of giving way under the\\nblows of the men outside.\\n\\n\"Here I am! Coming! Are you ready? Now, gentlemen, one at a time! . . .\"\\n\\nHe briskly turned the key and drew the bolt.\\n\\nShouts, threats, a roar of infuriated animals came through the open\\ndoorway.\\n\\nYet none of them dared come forward. Before rushing at Lupin, they\\nhesitated, seized with alarm, with fear. . . .\\n\\nThis was what he had reckoned on.\\n\\nStanding in the middle of the room, full in the light, with outstretched\\narm, he held between his fingers a sheaf of bank-notes, which he\\ndivided, counting them one by one, into seven equal shares. And he\\ncalmly said:\\n\\n\"Three thousand francs\\' reward for each of you, if Lupin is sent to his\\nlast account? That\\'s what you were promised, isn\\'t it? Here\\'s double the\\nmoney!\"\\n\\nHe laid the bundles on the table, within reach of the scoundrels.\\n\\nThe Broker roared:\\n\\n\"Humbug! He\\'s trying to gain time. Shoot him down!\"\\n\\nHe raised his arm. His companions held him back.\\n\\nAnd Lupin continued:\\n\\n\"Of course, this need not affect your plan of campaign. You came here,\\nfirst, to kidnap Mrs. Kesselbach and, secondly, to lay hands on her\\njewels. Far be it from me to interfere with your laudable intentions!\"\\n\\n\"Look here, what are you driving at?\" growled the Broker, listening in\\nspite of himself.\\n\\n\"Aha, Broker, I\\'m beginning to interest you, am I? . . . Come in, old\\nchap. . . . Come in, all of you. . . . There\\'s a draught at the top of\\nthose stairs . . . and such pretty fellows as you mustn\\'t run the risk\\nof catching cold. . . . What, are we afraid? Why, I\\'m all by myself!\\n. . . Come, pull yourselves together, my lambs!\"\\n\\nThey entered the room, puzzled and suspicious.\\n\\n\"Shut the door, Broker . . . we shall be more comfortable. Thanks, old\\nman. Oh, by the way, I see the notes are gone. Therefore we\\'re agreed.\\nHow easy it is for honest men to come to terms!\"\\n\\n\"Well . . . and next?\"\\n\\n\"Next? Well, as we\\'re partners . . .\"\\n\\n\"Partners?\"\\n\\n\"Why, haven\\'t you accepted my money? We\\'re working together, old man,\\nand we will carry off the young woman together first and carry off the\\njewels after.\"\\n\\nThe Broker grinned:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t want you for that.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you do, old man.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because you don\\'t know where the jewels are hidden and I do.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll find out.\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow. Not to-night.\"\\n\\n\"Well, let\\'s hear. What do you want?\"\\n\\n\"My share of the jewels.\"\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t you take the lot, as you know where they are?\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t get at them by myself. There\\'s a way of doing it, but I don\\'t\\nknow it. You\\'re here, so I\\'m making use of you.\"\\n\\nThe Broker hesitated:\\n\\n\"Share the jewels. . . . Share the jewels. . . . A few bits of glass and\\nbrass, most likely. . . .\"\\n\\n\"You fool! . . . There\\'s more than a million\\'s worth.\"\\n\\nThe men quivered under the impression made upon them.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said the Broker. \"But suppose the Kesselbach gets away?\\nShe\\'s in the next room, isn\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"No, she\\'s in here.\"\\n\\nLupin for a moment pulled back one of the leaves of the screen,\\nrevealing the heap of dresses and bed-clothes which he had laid out on\\nthe sofa:\\n\\n\"She\\'s here, fainting. But I shan\\'t give her up till we\\'ve divided.\"\\n\\n\"Still . . .\"\\n\\n\"You can take it or leave it. I don\\'t care if I am alone. You know what\\nI\\'m good for. So please yourselves. . . .\"\\n\\nThe men consulted with one another and the Broker said:\\n\\n\"Where is the hiding-place you\\'re talking of?\"\\n\\n\"Under the fireplace. But, when you don\\'t know the secret, you must\\nfirst lift up the whole chimneypiece, looking-glass, marble and all in a\\nlump, it seems. It\\'s no easy job.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh, we\\'re a smart lot, we are! Just you wait and see. In five minutes\\n. . .\"\\n\\nHe gave his orders and his pals at once set to work with admirable vigor\\nand discipline. Two of them, standing on chairs, tried to lift the\\nmirror. The four others attacked the fireplace itself. The Broker, on\\nhis knees, kept his eyes on the hearth and gave the word of command:\\n\\n\"Cheerily, lads! . . . Altogether, if you please! . . . Look out! . . .\\nOne, two . . . ah, there, it\\'s moving! . . .\"\\n\\nStanding behind them, with his hands in his pockets, Lupin watched them\\naffectionately and, at the same time, revelled with all his pride, as an\\nartist and master, in this striking proof of his authority, of his\\nmight, of the incredible sway which he wielded over others. How could\\nthose scoundrels for a second accept that improbable story and lose all\\nsense of things, to the point of relinquishing every chance of the fight\\nin his favor?\\n\\nHe took from his pockets two great massive and formidable revolvers and,\\ncalmly, choosing the first two men whom he would bring down and the two\\nwho would fall next, he aimed as he might have aimed at a pair of\\ntargets in a rifle-gallery.\\n\\nTwo shots together and two more. . . .\\n\\nLoud yells of pain. . . . Four men came tumbling down, one after the\\nother, like dolls at a cockshy.\\n\\n\"Four from seven leaves three,\" said Lupin. \"Shall I go on?\"\\n\\nHis arms remained outstretched, levelled at the Broker and his two pals.\\n\\n\"You swine!\" growled the Broker, feeling for a weapon.\\n\\n\"Hands up,\" cried Lupin, \"or I fire! . . . That\\'s it. . . . Now, you\\ntwo, take away his toys. . . . If not . . . !\"\\n\\nThe two scoundrels, shaking with fear, caught hold of their leader and\\ncompelled him to submit.\\n\\n\"Bind him! . . . Bind him, confound it! . . . What difference does it\\nmake to you? . . . Once I\\'m gone, you\\'re all free. . . . Come along,\\nhave you finished? The wrists first . . . with your belts. . . . And the\\nankles. . . . Hurry up! . . .\"\\n\\nThe Broker, beaten and disabled, made no further resistance. While his\\npals were binding him, Lupin stooped over them and dealt them two\\nterrific blows on the head with the butt-end of his revolver. They sank\\ndown in a heap.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a good piece of work,\" he said, taking breath. \"Pity there are\\nnot another fifty of them. I was just in the mood. . . . And all so\\neasily done . . . with a smile on one\\'s face. . . . What do you think of\\nit, Broker?\"\\n\\nThe scoundrel lay cursing. Lupin said:\\n\\n\"Cheer up, old man! Console yourself with the thought that you are\\nhelping in a good action, the rescue of Mrs. Kesselbach. She will thank\\nyou in person for your gallantry.\"\\n\\nHe went to the door of the second room and opened it:\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\" he said, stopping on the threshold, taken aback,\\ndumfounded.\\n\\nThe room was empty.\\n\\nHe went to the window, saw a ladder leaning against the balcony, a\\ntelescopic steel ladder, and muttered:\\n\\n\"Kidnapped . . . kidnapped . . . Louis de Malreich. . . . Oh, the\\nvillain! . . .\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nHe reflected for a minute, trying to master his anguish of mind, and\\nsaid to himself that, after all, as Mrs. Kesselbach seemed to be in no\\nimmediate danger, there was no cause for alarm.\\n\\nBut he was seized with a sudden fit of rage and flew at the seven\\nscoundrels, gave a kick or two to those of the wounded who stirred, felt\\nfor his bank-notes and put them back in his pocket, then gagged the\\nmen\\'s mouths and tied their hands with anything that he could\\nfind--blind-cords, curtain-loops, blankets and sheets reduced to\\nstrips--and, lastly, laid in a row on the carpet, in front of the sofa,\\nseven bundles of humanity, packed tight together and tied up like so\\nmany parcels:\\n\\n\"Mummies on toast!\" he chuckled. \"A dainty dish for those who like that\\nsort of thing! . . . You pack of fools, how does this suit you, eh?\\nThere you are, like corpses at the Morgue. . . . Serves you right for\\nattacking Lupin, Lupin the protector of the widow and orphan! . . . Are\\nyou trembling? Quite unnecessary, my lambs! Lupin never hurt a fly yet!\\n. . . Only, Lupin is a decent man, he can\\'t stand vermin; and the Lupin\\nknows his duty. I ask you, is life possible with a lot of scamps like\\nyou about? Think of it: no respect for other people\\'s lives; no respect\\nfor property, for laws, for society; no conscience; no anything! What\\nare we coming to? Lord, what are we coming to?\"\\n\\nWithout even taking the trouble to lock them in, he left the room, went\\ndown the street and walked until he came to his taxi. He sent the driver\\nin search of another and brought both cabs back to Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s\\nhouse.\\n\\nA good tip, paid in advance, avoided all tedious explanations. With the\\nhelp of the two men, he carried the seven prisoners down and plumped\\nthem anyhow, on one another\\'s knees, into the cabs. The wounded men\\nyelled and moaned. He shut the doors, shouting:\\n\\n\"Mind your hands!\"\\n\\nHe got up beside the driver of the front cab.\\n\\n\"Where to?\" asked the man.\\n\\n\"36, Quai des Orfevers: the detective-office.\"\\n\\nThe motors throbbed, the drivers started the gear and the strange\\nprocession went scooting down the slopes of the Trocadero.\\n\\nIn the streets, they passed a few vegetable-carts. Men carrying long\\npoles were turning out the street-lamps.\\n\\nThere were stars in the sky. A cool breeze was wafted through the air.\\n\\nLupin sang aloud:\\n\\nThe Place de la Concorde, the Louvre. . . . In the distance, the dark\\nbulk of Notre Dame. . . .\\n\\nHe turned round and half opened the door:\\n\\n\"Having a good time, mates? So am I, thank you. It\\'s a grand night for a\\ndrive and the air\\'s delicious! . . .\"\\n\\nThey were now bumping over the ill-paved quays. And soon they arrived at\\nthe Palais de Justice and the door of the detective-office.\\n\\n\"Wait here,\" said Lupin to the two drivers, \"and be sure you look after\\nyour seven fares.\"\\n\\nHe crossed the outer yard and went down the passage on the right leading\\nto the rooms of the central office. He found the night inspectors on\\nduty.\\n\\n\"A bag, gentlemen,\" he said, as he entered, \"a fine bag too. Is M. Weber\\nhere? I am the new commissary of police for Auteuil.\"\\n\\n\"M. Weber is in his flat. Do you want him sent for?\"\\n\\n\"Just one second. I\\'m in a hurry. I\\'ll leave a line for him.\"\\n\\nHe sat down at a table and wrote:\\n\\n      \"MY DEAR WEBER,\\n\\n      \"I am bringing you the seven scoundrels composing\\n      Altenheim\\'s gang, the men who killed Gourel (and\\n      plenty of others) and who killed me as well, under the\\n      name of M. Lenormand.\\n\\n      \"That only leaves their leader unaccounted for. I am\\n      going to effect his arrest this minute. Come and join\\n      me. He lives in the Rue Delaizement, at Neuilly and\\n      goes by the name of Leon Massier.\\n\\n        \"Kind regards.\\n                    \"Yours,\\n                                    \"ARSÈNE LUPIN,\\n                    \"_Chief of the Detective-service_.\"\\n\\nHe sealed the letter:\\n\\n\"Give that to M. Weber. It\\'s urgent. Now I want seven men to receive the\\ngoods. I left them on the quay.\"\\n\\nOn going back to the taxis, he was met by a chief inspector:\\n\\n\"Ah, it\\'s you M. Lebœuf!\" he said. \"I\\'ve made a fine haul. . . . The\\nwhole of Altenheim\\'s gang. . . . They\\'re there in the taxi-cabs.\"\\n\\n\"Where did you find them?\"\\n\\n\"Hard at work kidnapping Mrs. Kesselbach and robbing her house. But I\\'ll\\ntell you all about it when the time comes.\"\\n\\nThe chief inspector took him aside and, with the air of surprise:\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, monsieur, but I was sent for to see the commissary\\nof police for Auteuil. And I don\\'t seem to . . . Whom have I the honor\\nof addressing?\"\\n\\n\"Somebody who is making you a handsome present of seven hooligans of the\\nfinest quality.\"\\n\\n\"Still, I should like to know. . . .\"\\n\\n\"My name?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Arsène Lupin.\"\\n\\nHe nimbly tripped the chief inspector up, ran to the Rue de Rivoli,\\njumped into a passing taxi-cab and drove to the Porte des Ternes.\\n\\nThe Route de la Revolte was close by. He went to No. 3.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFor all his coolness and self-command, Arsène Lupin was unable to\\ncontrol his excitement. Would he find Dolores Kesselbach? Had Louis de\\nMalreich taken her either to his own place or to the Broker\\'s shed?\\n\\nLupin had taken the key of the shed from the Broker, so that it was easy\\nfor him, after ringing and walking across the different yards, to open\\nthe door and enter the lumber-shop.\\n\\nHe switched on his lantern and took his bearings. A little to the right\\nwas the free space in which he had seen the accomplices hold their last\\nconfabulation. On the sofa mentioned by the Broker he saw a black\\nfigure, Dolores lay wrapped in blankets and gagged.\\n\\nHe helped her up.\\n\\n\"Ah, it\\'s you, it\\'s you!\" she stammered. \"They haven\\'t touched you!\"\\n\\nAnd, rising and pointing to the back of the shop:\\n\\n\"There . . . he went out that side . . . I heard him. . . . I am sure.\\n. . . You must go . . . please!\"\\n\\n\"I must get you away first,\" he said.\\n\\n\"No, never mind me . . . go after him. . . . I entreat you. . . . Strike\\nhim!\"\\n\\nFear, this time, instead of dejecting her, seemed to be giving her\\nunwonted strength; and she repeated, with an immense longing to place\\nher terrible enemy in his power:\\n\\n\"Go after him first. . . . I can\\'t go on living like this. . . . You\\nmust save me from him. . . . I can\\'t go on living. . . .\"\\n\\nHe unfastened her bonds, laid her carefully on the sofa and said:\\n\\n\"You are right. . . . Besides, you have nothing to fear here. . . . Wait\\nfor me, I shall come back.\"\\n\\nAs he was going away, she caught hold of his hand:\\n\\n\"But you yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"If that man . . .\"\\n\\nIt was as though she dreaded for Lupin the great, final contest to which\\nshe was exposing him and as though, at the last moment, she would have\\nbeen glad to hold him back.\\n\\nHe said:\\n\\n\"Thank you, have no fear. What have I to be afraid of? He is alone.\"\\n\\nAnd, leaving her, he went to the back of the shed. As he expected, he\\nfound a ladder standing against the wall which brought him to the level\\nof the little window through which he had watched the scoundrels hold\\ntheir meeting. It was the way by which Malreich had returned to his\\nhouse in the Rue Delaizement.\\n\\nHe, therefore, took the same road, just as he had done a few hours\\nearlier, climbed into the loft of the other coach-house and down into\\nthe garden. He found himself at the back of the villa occupied by\\nMalreich.\\n\\nStrange to say, he did not doubt, for a moment that Malreich was there.\\nHe would meet him inevitably; the formidable battle which they were\\nwaging against each other was nearing its end. A few minutes more and,\\none way or another, all would be over.\\n\\nHe was amazed, on grasping the handle of a door, to find that the handle\\nturned and the door opened under his pressure. The villa was not even\\nlocked.\\n\\nHe passed through a kitchen, a hall and up a staircase; and he walked\\ndeliberately, without seeking to deaden the sound of his footsteps.\\n\\nOn the landing, he stopped. The perspiration streamed from his forehead;\\nand his temples throbbed under the rush of his blood. Nevertheless, he\\nremained calm, master of himself and conscious of his least thoughts. He\\nlaid two revolvers on a stair:\\n\\n\"No weapons,\" he said to himself. \"My hands only, just the effort of my\\ntwo hands. . . . That\\'s quite enough. . . . That will be better. . . .\"\\n\\nOpposite him were three doors. He chose the middle one, turned the\\nhandle and encountered no obstacle. He went in. There was no light in\\nthe room, but the rays of the night entered through the wide-open window\\nand, amid the darkness, he saw the sheets and the white curtains of the\\nbed.\\n\\nAnd somebody was standing beside it.\\n\\nHe savagely cast the gleam of his lantern upon that form.\\n\\nMalreich!\\n\\nThe pallid face of Malreich, his dim eyes, his cadaverous cheek-bones,\\nhis scraggy neck. . . .\\n\\nAnd all this stood motionless, opposite him, at five steps\\' distance;\\nand he could not have said whether that dull face, that death-face,\\nexpressed the least terror or even a grain of anxiety.\\n\\nLupin took a step forward . . . and a second . . . and a third. . . .\\n\\nThe man did not move.\\n\\nDid he see? Did he understand? It was as though the man\\'s eyes were\\ngazing into space and that he thought himself possessed by an\\nhallucination, rather than looking upon a real image.\\n\\nOne more step. . . .\\n\\n\"He will defend himself,\" thought Lupin, \"he is bound to defend\\nhimself.\"\\n\\nAnd Lupin thrust out his arms.\\n\\nThe man did not make a movement. He did not retreat; his eyelids did not\\nblink.\\n\\nThe contact took place.\\n\\nAnd it was Lupin, scared and bewildered, who lost his head. He knocked\\nthe man back upon his bed, stretched him at full length, rolled him in\\nthe sheets, bound him in the blankets and held him under his knee, like\\na prey . . . whereas the man had not made the slightest movement of\\nresistance.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" shouted Lupin, drunk with delight and satisfied hatred. \"At last I\\nhave crushed you, you odious brute! At last I am the master!\"\\n\\nHe heard a noise outside, in the Rue Delaizement; men knocking at the\\ngate. He ran to the window and cried:\\n\\n\"Is that you, Weber? Already? Well done! You are a model servant! Break\\ndown the gate, old chap, and come up here; delighted to see you!\"\\n\\nIn a few minutes, he searched his prisoner\\'s clothes, got hold of his\\npocket-book, cleared the papers out of the drawers of the desk and the\\ndavenport, flung them on the table and went through them.\\n\\nHe gave a shout of joy: the bundle of letters was there, the famous\\nbundle of letters which he had promised to restore to the Emperor.\\n\\nHe put back the papers in their place and went to the window:\\n\\n\"It\\'s all finished, Weber! You can come in! You will find Mr.\\nKesselbach\\'s murderer in his bed, all ready tied up. . . . Good-bye,\\nWeber!\"\\n\\nAnd Lupin, tearing down the stairs, ran to the coach-house and went back\\nto Dolores Kesselbach, while Weber was breaking into the villa.\\n\\nSingle-handed, he had arrested Altenheim\\'s seven companions!\\n\\nAnd he had delivered to justice the mysterious leader of the gang, the\\ninfamous monster, Louis de Malreich!\\n\\nA young man sat writing at a table on a wide wooden balcony.\\n\\nFrom time to time, he raised his head and cast a vague glance toward the\\nhorizon of hills, where the trees, stripped by the autumn, were shedding\\ntheir last leaves over the red roofs of the villas and the lawns of the\\ngardens. Then he went on writing.\\n\\nPresently he took up his paper and read aloud:\\n\\n    Nos jours s\\'en vont à la dérive,\\n    Comme emportés par un courant\\n    Qui les pousse vers une rive\\n    Où l\\'on n\\'aborde qu\\'en mourant.[10]\\n\\n[Footnote 10:  Our days go by, adrift, adrift,\\n               Borne along by current swift\\n               That urges them toward the strand\\n               Where not until we die, we land.]\\n\\n\"Not so bad,\" said a voice behind him. \"Mme. Amable Tastu might have\\nwritten that, or Mrs. Felicia Hemans. However, we can\\'t all be Byrons or\\nLamartines!\"\\n\\n\"You! . . . You! . . .\" stammered the young man, in dismay.\\n\\n\"Yes, I, poet, I myself, Arsène Lupin come to see his dear friend Pierre\\nLeduc.\"\\n\\nPierre Leduc began to shake, as though shivering with fever. He asked,\\nin a low voice:\\n\\n\"Has the hour come?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear Pierre Leduc: the hour has come for you to give up, or\\nrather to interrupt the slack poet\\'s life which you have been leading\\nfor months at the feet of Geneviève Ernemont and Mrs. Kesselbach and to\\nperform the part which I have allotted to you in my play . . . oh, a\\nfine play, I assure you, thoroughly well-constructed, according to all\\nthe canons of art, with top notes, comic relief and gnashing of teeth\\ngalore! We have reached the fifth act; the grand finale is at hand; and\\nyou, Pierre Leduc, are the hero. There\\'s fame for you!\"\\n\\nThe young man rose from his seat:\\n\\n\"And suppose I refuse?\"\\n\\n\"Idiot!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, suppose I refuse? After all, what obliges me to submit to your\\nwill? What obliges me to accept a part which I do not know, but which I\\nloathe in advance and feel ashamed of?\"\\n\\n\"Idiot!\" repeated Lupin.\\n\\nAnd forcing Pierre Leduc back into his chair, he sat down beside him\\nand, in the gentlest of voices:\\n\\n\"You quite forget, my dear young man, that you are not Pierre Leduc, but\\nGérard Baupré. That you bear the beautiful name of Pierre Leduc is due\\nto the fact that you, Gérard Baupré, killed Pierre Leduc and robbed him\\nof his individuality.\"\\n\\nThe young man bounded with indignation:\\n\\n\"You are mad! You know as well as I do that you conceived the whole\\nplot. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know that, of course; but the law doesn\\'t know it; and what will\\nthe law say when I come forward with proof that the real Pierre Leduc\\ndied a violent death and that you have taken his place?\"\\n\\nThe young man, overwhelmed with consternation, stammered:\\n\\n\"No one will believe you. . . . Why should I have done that? With what\\nobject?\"\\n\\n\"Idiot! The object is so self-evident that Weber himself could have\\nperceived it. You lie when you say that you will not accept a part which\\nyou do not know. You know your part quite well. It is the part which\\nPierre Leduc would have played were he not dead.\"\\n\\n\"But Pierre Leduc, to me, to everybody, was only a name. Who was he? Who\\nam I?\"\\n\\n\"What difference can that make to you?\"\\n\\n\"I want to know. I want to know what I am doing!\"\\n\\n\"And, if you know, will you go straight ahead?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, if the object of which you speak is worth it.\"\\n\\n\"If it were not, do you think I would take all this trouble?\"\\n\\n\"Who am I? Whatever my destiny, you may be sure that I shall prove\\nworthy of it. But I want to know. Who am I?\"\\n\\nArsène Lupin took off his hat, bowed and said: \"Hermann IV., Grand-duke\\nof Zweibrucken-Veldenz, Prince of Berncastel, Elector of Treves and lord\\nof all sorts of places.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThree days later, Arsène Lupin took Mrs. Kesselbach away in a motor-car\\nin the direction of the frontier. The journey was accomplished in\\nsilence, Lupin remembered with emotion Dolores\\'s terrified conduct and\\nthe words which she spoke in the house in the Rue des Vignes, when he\\nwas about to defend her against Altenheim\\'s accomplices. And she must\\nhave remembered also, for she remained embarrassed and evidently\\nperturbed in his presence.\\n\\nIn the evening they reached a small castle, all covered with creepers\\nand flowers, roofed with an enormous slate cap and standing in a large\\ngarden full of ancestral trees.\\n\\nHere Mrs. Kesselbach found Geneviève already installed, after a visit to\\nthe neighboring town, where she had engaged a staff of servants from\\namong the country-people.\\n\\n\"This will be your residence, madame,\" said Lupin. \"You are at Bruggen\\nCastle. You will be quite safe here, while waiting the outcome of these\\nevents. I have written to Pierre Leduc and he will be your guest from\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\\nHe started off again at once, drove to Veldenz and handed over to Count\\nvon Waldemar the famous letters which he had recaptured:\\n\\n\"You know my conditions, my dear Waldemar,\" said Lupin. \"The first and\\nmost important thing is to restore the House of Zweibrucken-Veldenz and\\nto reinstate the Grand-duke Hermann IV., in the grand-duchy.\"\\n\\n\"I shall open negotiations with the Council of Regency to-day. According\\nto my information, it will not be a difficult matter. But this\\nGrand-duke Hermann. . . .\"\\n\\n\"His Royal Highness is at present staying at Bruggen Castle, under the\\nname of Pierre Leduc. I will supply all the necessary proofs of his\\nidentity.\"\\n\\nThat same evening, Lupin took the road back to Paris, with the intention\\nof actively hurrying on the trial of Malreich and the seven scoundrels.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIt would be wearisome to recapitulate the story of the case: the facts,\\ndown to the smallest details, are in the memory of one and all. It was\\none of those sensational events which still form a subject of\\nconversation and discussion among the weather-beaten laborers in the\\nremotest villages.\\n\\nBut what I wish to recall is the enormous part played by Lupin in the\\nconduct of the case and in the incidents appertaining to the preliminary\\ninquiry. As a matter of fact, it was he who managed the inquiry. From\\nthe very start, he took the place of the authorities, ordering\\npolice-searches, directing the measures to be taken, prescribing the\\nquestions to be put to the prisoners, assuming the responsibility for\\neverything.\\n\\nWe can all remember the universal amazement when, morning after morning,\\nwe read in the papers those letters, so irresistible in their masterly\\nlogic, signed, by turns:\\n\\n      \"ARSÈNE LUPIN, _Examining-magistrate_.\"\\n\\n      \"ARSÈNE LUPIN, _Public Prosecutor_.\"\\n\\n      \"ARSÈNE LUPIN, _Minister of Justice_.\"\\n\\n      \"ARSÈNE LUPIN, _Copper_.\"\\n\\nHe flung himself into the business with a spirit, an ardor, a violence,\\neven, that was astonishing in one usually so full of light-hearted chaff\\nand, when all was said, so naturally disposed by temperament to display\\na certain professional indulgence.\\n\\nNo, this time he was prompted by hatred.\\n\\nHe hated Louis de Malreich, that bloodthirsty scoundrel, that foul\\nbrute, of whom he had always been afraid and who, even beaten, even in\\nprison, still gave him that sensation of dread and repugnance which one\\nfeels at the sight of a reptile.\\n\\nBesides, had not Malreich had the audacity to persecute Dolores?\\n\\n\"He has played and lost,\" said Lupin. \"He shall pay for it with his\\nhead.\"\\n\\nThat was what he wanted for his terrible enemy: the scaffold, the bleak,\\ndull morning when the blade of the guillotine slides down and kills.\\n. . .\\n\\nIt was a strange prisoner whom the examining-magistrate questioned for\\nmonths on end between the four walls of his room, a strange figure, that\\nbony man, with the skeleton face and the lifeless eyes!\\n\\nHe seemed quite out of himself. His thoughts were not there, but\\nelsewhere. And he cared so little about answering!\\n\\n\"My name is Leon Massier.\"\\n\\nThat was the one sentence to which he confined himself.\\n\\nAnd Lupin retorted.\\n\\n\"You lie. Leon Massier, born at Perigueux, left fatherless at the age of\\nten, died seven years ago. You took his papers. But you forgot his\\ndeath-certificate. Here it is.\"\\n\\nAnd Lupin sent a copy of the document to the public prosecutor.\\n\\n\"I am Leon Massier,\" declared the prisoner, once again.\\n\\n\"You lie,\" replied Lupin. \"You are Louis de Malreich, the last surviving\\ndescendant of a small French noble who settled in Germany in the\\neighteenth century. You had a brother who called himself Parbury,\\nRibeira and Altenheim, by turns: you killed your brother. You had a\\nsister, Isilda de Malreich: you killed your sister.\"\\n\\n\"I am Leon Massier.\"\\n\\n\"You lie. You are Malreich. Here is your birth-certificate. Here are\\nyour brother\\'s and your sister\\'s.\"\\n\\nAnd Lupin sent the three certificates.\\n\\nApart from the question of his identity, Malreich, crushed, no doubt, by\\nthe accumulation of proofs brought up against him, did not defend\\nhimself. What could he say? They had forty notes written in his own\\nhand--a comparison of the handwritings established the fact--written in\\nhis own hand to the gang of his accomplices, forty notes which he had\\nomitted to tear up after taking them back. And all these notes were\\norders relating to the Kesselbach case, the capture of M. Lenormand and\\nGourel, the pursuit of old Steinweg, the construction of the underground\\npassages at Garches and so on. What possibility was there of a denial?\\n\\nOne rather odd thing baffled the law officers. The seven scoundrels,\\nwhen confronted with their leader, all declared that they did not know\\nhim, because they had never seen him. They received his instructions\\neither by telephone, or else in the dark, by means of those same little\\nnotes which Malreich slipped into their hands without a word.\\n\\nBut, for the rest, was not the existence of the communication between\\nthe villa in the Rue Delaizement and the Broker\\'s shed an ample proof of\\ncomplicity? From that spot, Malreich saw and heard. From that spot, the\\nleader watched his men.\\n\\nDiscrepancies? Apparently irreconcilable facts? Lupin explained them all\\naway. In a celebrated article, published on the morning of the trial, he\\ntook up the case from the start, revealed what lay beneath it,\\nunravelled its web, showed Malreich, unknown to all, living in the room\\nof his brother, the sham Major Parbury, passing unseen along the\\npassages of the Palace Hotel and murdering Mr. Kesselbach, murdering\\nBeudot the floor-waiter, murdering Chapman the secretary.\\n\\nThe trial lingers in the memory. It was both terrifying and gloomy:\\nterrifying because of the atmosphere of anguish that hung over the crowd\\nof onlookers and the recollection of crime and blood that obsessed\\ntheir minds: gloomy, heavy, darksome, stifling because of the tremendous\\nsilence observed by the prisoner.\\n\\nNot a protest, not a movement, not a word. A face of wax that neither\\nsaw nor heard. An awful vision of impassive calmness! The people in\\ncourt shuddered. Their distraught imaginations conjured up a sort of\\nsupernatural being rather than a man, a sort of genie out of the Arabian\\nNights, one of those Hindu gods who symbolize all that is ferocious,\\ncruel, sanguinary and pernicious.\\n\\nAs for the other scoundrels, the people did not even look at them,\\ntreated them as insignificant supers overshadowed by that stupendous\\nleader.\\n\\nThe most sensational evidence was that given by Mrs. Kesselbach. To the\\ngeneral astonishment and to Lupin\\'s own surprise, Dolores, who had\\nanswered none of the magistrate\\'s summonses and who had retired to an\\nunknown spot, Dolores appeared, a sorrow-stricken widow, to give damning\\nevidence against her husband\\'s murderer.\\n\\nShe gazed at him for many seconds and then said, simply:\\n\\n\"That is the man who entered my house in the Rue des Vignes, who carried\\nme off and who locked me up in the Broker\\'s shed. I recognize him.\"\\n\\n\"On your oath?\"\\n\\n\"I swear it before God and man.\"\\n\\nTwo days later, Louis de Malreich, _alias_ Leon Massier was sentenced to\\ndeath. And his overpowering personality may be said to have absorbed\\nthat of his accomplices to such an extent that they received the benefit\\nof extenuating circumstances.\\n\\n\"Louis de Malreich have you nothing to say?\" asked the presiding judge.\\n\\nHe made no reply.\\n\\nOne question alone remained undecided in Lupin\\'s eyes: why had Malreich\\ncommitted all those crimes? What did he want? What was his object?\\n\\nLupin was soon to understand; and the day was not far off when, gasping\\nwith horror, struck, mortally smitten with despair, he would know the\\nawful truth.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFor the moment, although the thought of it constantly hovered over his\\nmind, he ceased to occupy himself with the Malreich case. Resolved to\\nget a new skin, as he put it; reassured, on the other hand, as to the\\nfate of Mrs. Kesselbach and Geneviève, over whose peaceful existence he\\nwatched from afar; and, lastly, kept informed by Jean Doudeville, whom\\nhe had sent to Veldenz, of all the negotiations that were being pursued\\nbetween the court of Berlin and the regent of Zweibrucken-Veldenz, he\\nemployed all his time in winding up the past and preparing for the\\nfuture.\\n\\nThe thought of the different life which he wished to lead under the eyes\\nof Mrs. Kesselbach filled him with new ambitions and unexpected\\nsentiments, in which the image of Dolores played a part, without his\\nbeing able to tell exactly how or why.\\n\\nIn a few weeks, he got rid of all the proofs that could have compromised\\nhim sooner or later, all the traces that could have led to his ruin. He\\ngave each of his old companions a sum of money sufficient to keep them\\nfrom want for the rest of their lives and said good-bye to them, saying\\nthat he was going to South America.\\n\\nOne morning, after a night of careful thought and a deep study of the\\nsituation, he cried:\\n\\n\"It\\'s done. There\\'s nothing to fear now. The old Lupin is dead. Make way\\nfor the young one.\"\\n\\nHis man brought him a telegram from Germany. It contained the news for\\nwhich he had been waiting. The Council of Regency, greatly influenced by\\nthe Court of Berlin, had referred the question to the electors; and the\\nelectors, greatly influenced by the Council of Regency, had declared\\ntheir unshaken attachment to the old dynasty of the Veldenz. Count von\\nWaldemar was deputed, together with three delegates selected from the\\nnobility, the army and the law, to go to Bruggen Castle, carefully to\\nestablish the identity of the Grand-duke Hermann IV. and to make all the\\narrangements with His Royal Highness for his triumphal entry into the\\nprincipality of his fathers, which was to take place in the course of\\nthe following month.\\n\\n\"This time, I\\'ve pulled it off,\" said Lupin to himself. \"Mr.\\nKesselbach\\'s great scheme is being realized. All that remains for me to\\ndo is to make Waldemar swallow Pierre Leduc; and that is child\\'s play.\\nThe banns between Geneviève and Pierre shall be published to-morrow. And\\nit shall be the grand-duke\\'s affianced bride that will be presented to\\nWaldemar.\"\\n\\nFull of glee, he started in his motor for Bruggen Castle.\\n\\nHe sang in the car, he whistled, he chatted to his chauffeur:\\n\\n\"Octave, do you know whom you have the honor of driving? The master of\\nthe world! . . . Yes, old man, that staggers you, eh? Just so, but it\\'s\\nthe truth. I am the master of the world.\"\\n\\nHe rubbed his hands and went on soliloquizing:\\n\\n\"All the same, it was a long job. It\\'s a year since the fight began.\\nTrue, it was the most formidable fight I ever stood to win or lose.\\n. . . By Jupiter, what a war of giants!\" And he repeated, \"But this\\ntime, I\\'ve pulled it off! The enemies are in the water. There are no\\nobstacles left between the goal and me. The site is free: let us build\\nupon it! I have the materials at hand, I have the workmen: let us build,\\nLupin! And let the palace be worthy of you!\"\\n\\nHe stopped the car at a few hundred yards from the castle, so that his\\narrival might create as little fuss as possible, and said to Octave:\\n\\n\"Wait here for twenty minutes, until four o\\'clock, and then drive in.\\nTake my bags to the little chalet at the end of the park. That\\'s where I\\nshall sleep.\"\\n\\nAt the first turn of the road, the castle appeared in sight, standing at\\nthe end of a dark avenue of lime trees. From the distance, he saw\\nGeneviève passing on the terrace.\\n\\nHis heart was softly stirred:\\n\\n\"Geneviève, Geneviève,\" he said, fondly. \"Geneviève . . . the vow which\\nI made to the dying mother is being fulfilled as well. . . . Geneviève a\\ngrand-duchess! . . . And I, in the shade, watching over her happiness\\n. . . and pursuing the great schemes of Arsène Lupin!\"\\n\\nHe burst out laughing, sprang behind a cluster of trees that stood to\\nthe left of the avenue and slipped along the thick shrubberies. In this\\nway, he reached the castle without the possibility of his being seen\\nfrom the windows of the drawing-room or the principal bedrooms.\\n\\nHe wanted to see Dolores before she saw him and pronounced her name\\nseveral times, as he had pronounced Geneviève\\'s, but with an emotion\\nthat surprised himself:\\n\\n\"Dolores. . . . Dolores. . . .\"\\n\\nHe stole along the passages and reached the dining-room. From this room,\\nthrough a glass panel, he could see half the drawing-room.\\n\\nHe drew nearer.\\n\\nDolores was lying on a couch; and Pierre Leduc, on his knees before her,\\nwas gazing at her with eyes of ecstasy. . . .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nTHE MAP OF EUROPE\\n\\n\\nPierre Leduc loved Dolores!\\n\\nLupin felt a keen, penetrating pain in the depths of his being, as\\nthough he had been wounded in the very source of life; a pain so great\\nthat, for the first time, he had a clear perception of what Dolores had\\ngradually, unknown to himself, become to him.\\n\\nPierre Leduc loved Dolores! And he was looking at her as a man looks at\\nthe woman he loves.\\n\\nLupin felt a murderous instinct rise up within him, blindly and\\nfuriously. That look, that look of love cast upon Dolores, maddened him.\\nHe received an impression of the great silence that enveloped Dolores\\nand Pierre Leduc; and in silence, in the stillness of their attitude\\nthere was nothing living but that look of love, that dumb and sensuous\\nhymn in which the eyes told all the passion, all the desire, all the\\ntransport, all the yearning that one being can feel for another.\\n\\nAnd he saw Mrs. Kesselbach also. Dolores\\' eyes were invisible under\\ntheir lowered lids, the silky eyelids with the long black lashes. But\\nhow she seemed to feel that look of love which sought for hers! How she\\nquivered under that impalpable caress!\\n\\n\"She loves him . . . she loves him,\" thought Lupin, burning with\\njealousy.\\n\\nAnd, when Pierre made a movement:\\n\\n\"Oh, the villain! If he dares to touch her, I will kill him!\"\\n\\nThen, realizing the disorder of his reason and striving to combat it, he\\nsaid to himself:\\n\\n\"What a fool I am! What, you, Lupin, letting your self go like this!\\n. . . Look here, it\\'s only natural that she should love him. . . . Yes,\\nof course, you expected her to show a certain emotion at your arrival\\n. . . a certain agitation. . . . You silly idiot, you\\'re only a thief, a\\nrobber . . . whereas he is a prince and young. . . .\"\\n\\nPierre had not stirred further. But his lips moved and it seemed as\\nthough Dolores were waking. Softly, slowly, she raised her lids, turned\\nher head a little and her eyes met the young man\\'s eyes with the look\\nthat offers itself and surrenders itself and is more intense than the\\nmost intense of kisses.\\n\\nWhat followed came suddenly and unexpectedly, like a thunder-clap. In\\nthree bounds, Lupin rushed into the drawing-room, sprang upon the young\\nman, flung him to the ground and, with one hand on his rival\\'s chest,\\nbeside himself with anger, turning to Mrs. Kesselbach, he cried:\\n\\n\"But don\\'t you know? Hasn\\'t he told you, the cheat? . . . And you love\\nhim, you love that! Does he look like a grand-duke? Oh, what a joke!\"\\n\\nHe grinned and chuckled like a madman, while Dolores gazed at him in\\nstupefaction:\\n\\n\"He, a grand-duke! Hermann IV., Grand-duke of Zweibrucken-Veldenz! A\\nreigning sovereign! Elector of Treves! But it\\'s enough to make one die\\nof laughing! He! Why, his name is Baupré, Gérard Baupré, the lowest of\\nragamuffins . . . a beggar, whom I picked up in the gutter! . . . A\\ngrand-duke? But it\\'s I who made him a grand-duke! Ha, ha, ha, what a\\njoke! . . . If you had seen him cut his little finger . . . he fainted\\nthree times . . . the milksop! . . . Ah, you allow yourself to lift your\\neyes to ladies . . . and to rebel against the master! . . . Wait a bit,\\nGrand-duke of Zweibrucken-Veldenz, I\\'ll show you!\"\\n\\nHe took him in his arms, like a bundle, swung him to and fro for a\\nmoment and pitched him through the open window:\\n\\n\"Mind the rose trees, grand-duke! There are thorns!\"\\n\\nWhen he turned round, Dolores was close to him and looking at him with\\neyes which he had never seen in her before, the eyes of a woman who\\nhates and who is incensed with rage. Could this possibly be Dolores, the\\nweak, ailing Dolores?\\n\\nShe stammered:\\n\\n\"What are you doing? . . . How dare you? . . . And he. . . . Then it\\'s\\ntrue? . . . lied to me? . . .\"\\n\\n\"Lied to you?\" cried Lupin, grasping the humiliation which she had\\nsuffered as a woman. \"Lied to you? He, a grand-duke! A puppet, that\\'s\\nall, a puppet of which I pulled the string . . . an instrument which I\\ntuned, to play upon as I chose! Oh, the fool, the fool!\"\\n\\nOvercome with renewed rage, he stamped his foot and shook his fist at\\nthe open window. And he began to walk up and down the room, flinging out\\nphrases in which all the pent-up violence of his secret thought burst\\nforth:\\n\\n\"The fool! Then he didn\\'t see what I expected of him? He did not suspect\\nthe greatness of the part he was to play? Oh, I shall have to drive it\\ninto his noddle by force, I see! Lift up your head, you idiot! You shall\\nbe grand-duke by the grace of Lupin! And a reigning sovereign! With a\\ncivil list! And subjects to fleece! And a palace which Charlemagne shall\\nrebuild for you! And a master that shall be I, Lupin! Do you understand,\\nyou numskull? Lift up your head, dash it! Higher than that! Look up at\\nthe sky, remember that a Zweibrucken was hanged for cattle-lifting\\nbefore the Hohenzollerns were ever heard of. And you are a Zweibrucken,\\nby Jove, no less; and I am here, I, I, Lupin! And you shall be\\ngrand-duke, I tell you! A paste-board grand-duke? Very well! But a\\ngrand-duke all the same, quickened with my breath and glowing with my\\nardor. A puppet? Very well. But a puppet that shall speak _my_ words and\\nmake _my_ movements and perform _my_ wishes and realize _my_ dreams\\n. . . yes . . . my dreams.\"\\n\\nHe stood motionless, as though dazzled by the glory of his conception.\\nThen he went up to Dolores and, sinking his voice, with a sort of mystic\\nexaltation, he said:\\n\\n\"On my left, Alsace-Lorraine. . . . On my right, Baden, Wurtemburg,\\nBavaria. . . . South Germany . . . all those disconnected, discontented\\nstates, crushed under the heel of the Prussian Charlemagne, but restless\\nand ready to throw off the yoke at any moment. . . . Do you understand\\nall that a man like myself can do in the midst of that, all the\\naspirations that he can kindle, all the hatred that he can produce, all\\nthe angry rebellion that he can inspire?\"\\n\\nIn a still lower voice, he repeated:\\n\\n\"And, on my left, Alsace-Lorraine! . . . Do you fully understand? . . .\\nDreams? Not at all! It is the reality of the day after to-morrow, of\\nto-morrow! . . . Yes. . . . I wish it. . . . I wish it. . . . Oh, all\\nthat I wish and all that I mean to do is unprecedented! . . . Only\\nthink, at two steps from the Alsatian frontier! In the heart of German\\nterritory! Close to the old Rhine! . . . A little intrigue, a little\\ngenius will be enough to change the surface of the earth. Genius I have\\n. . . and to spare. . . . And I shall be the master! I shall be the man\\nwho directs. The other, the puppet can have the title and the honors.\\n. . . I shall have the power! . . . I shall remain in the background. No\\noffice: I will not be a minister, nor even a chamberlain. Nothing. I\\nshall be one of the servants in the palace, the gardener perhaps. . . .\\nYes, the gardener. . . . Oh, what a tremendous life! To grow flowers and\\nalter the map of Europe!\"\\n\\nShe looked at him greedily, dominated, swayed by the strength of that\\nman. And her eyes expressed an admiration which she did not seek to\\nconceal.\\n\\nHe put his hands on Dolores\\' shoulders and said:\\n\\n\"That is my dream. Great as it is, it will be surpassed by the facts:\\nthat I swear to you. The Kaiser has already seen what I am good for. One\\nday, he will find me installed in front of him, face to face. I hold all\\nthe trumps. Valenglay will act at my bidding. . . . England also. . . .\\nThe game is played and won. . . . That is my dream. . . . There is\\nanother one. . . .\"\\n\\nHe stopped suddenly. Dolores did not take her eyes from him; and an\\ninfinite emotion changed every feature of her face.\\n\\nA vast joy penetrated him as he once more felt, and clearly felt, that\\nwoman\\'s confusion in his presence. He no longer had the sense of being\\nto her . . . what he was, a thief, a robber; he was a man, a man who\\nloved and whose love roused unspoken feelings in the depths of a\\nfriendly soul.\\n\\nThen he said no more, but he lavished upon her, unuttered, every known\\nword of love and admiration; and he thought of the life which he might\\nlead somewhere, not far from Veldenz, unknown and all-powerful. . . .\\n\\nA long silence united them. Then she rose and said, softly:\\n\\n\"Go away, I entreat you to go. . . . Pierre shall marry Geneviève, I\\npromise you that, but it is better that you should go . . . that you\\nshould not be here. . . . Go. Pierre shall marry Geneviève.\"\\n\\nHe waited for a moment. Perhaps he would rather have had more definite\\nwords, but he dared not ask for anything. And he withdrew, dazed,\\nintoxicated and happy to obey, to subject his destiny to hers!\\n\\nOn his way to the door, he came upon a low chair, which he had to move.\\nBut his foot knocked against something. He looked down. It was a little\\npocket-mirror, in ebony, with a gold monogram.\\n\\nSuddenly, he started and snatched up the mirror. The monogram consisted\\nof two letters interlaced, an \"L\" and an \"M.\"\\n\\nAn \"L\" and an \"M!\"\\n\\n\"Louis de Malreich,\" he said to himself, with a shudder.\\n\\nHe turned to Dolores:\\n\\n\"Where does this mirror come from? Whose is it? It is important that I\\nshould . . .\"\\n\\nShe took it from him and looked at it:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. . . . I never saw it before . . . a servant, perhaps.\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"A servant, no doubt,\" he said, \"but it is very odd . . . it is one of\\nthose coincidences. . . .\"\\n\\nAt that moment, Geneviève entered by the other door, and without seeing\\nLupin, who was hidden by a screen, at once exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Why, there\\'s your glass, Dolores! . . . So you have found it, after\\nmaking me hunt for it all this time! . . . Where was it?\" And the girl\\nwent away saying, \"Oh, well, I\\'m very glad it\\'s found! . . . How upset\\nyou were! . . . I will go and tell them at once to stop looking for it.\\n. . .\"\\n\\nLupin had not moved. He was confused, and tried in vain to understand.\\nWhy had Dolores not spoken the truth? Why had she not at once said whose\\nthe mirror was?\\n\\nAn idea flashed across his mind; and he asked, more or less at random:\\n\\n\"Do you know Louis de Malreich?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said, watching him, as though striving to guess the thoughts\\nthat beset him.\\n\\nHe rushed toward her, in a state of intense excitement:\\n\\n\"You know him? Who was he? Who is he? Who is he? And why did you not\\ntell me? Where have you known him? Speak . . . answer. . . . I implore\\nyou. . . .\"\\n\\n\"No,\" she said.\\n\\n\"But you must, you must. . . . Think! Louis de Malreich! The murderer!\\nThe monster! . . . Why did you not tell me?\"\\n\\nShe, in turn, placed her hands on Lupin\\'s shoulders and, in a firm\\nvoice, declared:\\n\\n\"Listen, you must never ask me, because I shall never tell. . . . It is\\na secret which I shall take with me to the grave. . . . Come what may,\\nno one will ever know, no one in the wide world, I swear it!\"\\n\\nHe stood before her for some minutes, anxiously, with a confused brain.\\n\\nHe remembered Steinweg\\'s silence and the old man\\'s terror when Lupin\\nasked him to reveal the terrible secret. Dolores also knew and she also\\nrefused to speak.\\n\\nHe went out without a word.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe open air, the sense of space, did him good. He passed out through\\nthe park-wall and wandered long over the country. And he soliloquized\\naloud:\\n\\n\"What does it mean? What is happening? For months and months, fighting\\nhard and acting, I have been pulling the strings of all the characters\\nthat are to help me in the execution of my plans; and, during this time,\\nI have completely forgotten to stoop over them and see what is going on\\nin their hearts and brains. I do not know Pierre Leduc, I do not know\\nGeneviève, I do not know Dolores. . . . And I have treated them as so\\nmany jumping-jacks, whereas they are live persons. And to-day I am\\nstumbling over obstacles.\"\\n\\nHe stamped his foot and cried:\\n\\n\"Over obstacles that do not exist! What do I care for the psychological\\nstate of Geneviève, of Pierre? . . . I will study that later, at\\nVeldenz, when I have secured their happiness. But Dolores . . . she knew\\nMalreich and said nothing! . . . Why? What relation united them? Was she\\nafraid of him? Is she afraid that he will escape from prison and come to\\nrevenge himself for an indiscretion on her part?\"\\n\\nAt night, he went to the chalet which he had allotted to his own use at\\nthe end of the park and dined in a very bad temper, storming at Octave,\\nwho waited on him and who was always either too slow or too fast:\\n\\n\"I\\'m sick of it, leave me alone. . . . You\\'re doing everything wrong\\nto-day. . . . And this coffee. . . . It\\'s not fit to drink.\"\\n\\nHe pushed back his cup half-full and, for two hours, walked about the\\npark, sifting the same ideas over and over again. At last, one\\nsuggestion took definite shape within his mind:\\n\\n\"Malreich has escaped from prison. He is terrifying Mrs. Kesselbach. By\\nthis time, he already knows the story of the mirror from her. . . .\"\\n\\nLupin shrugged his shoulders:\\n\\n\"And to-night he\\'s coming to pull my leg, I suppose! I\\'m talking\\nnonsense. The best thing I can do is to go to bed.\"\\n\\nHe went to his room, undressed and got into bed. He fell asleep at once,\\nwith a heavy sleep disturbed by nightmares. Twice he woke and tried to\\nlight his candle and twice fell back, as though stunned by a blow.\\n\\nNevertheless, he heard the hours strike on the village clock, or rather\\nhe thought that he heard them strike, for he was plunged in a sort of\\ntorpor in which he seemed to retain all his wits.\\n\\nAnd he was haunted by dreams, dreams of anguish and terror. He plainly\\nheard the sound of his window opening. He plainly, through his closed\\neyelids, through the thick darkness, _saw_ a form come toward the bed.\\n\\nAnd the form bent over him.\\n\\nHe made the incredible effort needed to raise his eyelids and look\\n. . . or, at least, he imagined that he did. Was he dreaming? Was he\\nawake? He asked himself the question in despair.\\n\\nA further sound. . . .\\n\\nHe took up the box of matches by his bedside:\\n\\n\"Let\\'s have a light on it,\" he said, with a great sense of elation.\\n\\nHe struck a match and lit the candle.\\n\\nLupin felt the perspiration stream over his skin, from head to foot,\\nwhile his heart ceased beating, stopped with terror. _The man was\\nthere._\\n\\nWas it possible? No, no . . . and yet he _saw_. . . . Oh, the fearsome\\nsight! . . . The man, the monster, was there. . . .\\n\\n\"He shall not . . . he shall not,\" stammered Lupin madly.\\n\\nThe man, the monster was there, dressed in black, with a mask on his\\nface and with his felt hat pulled down over his fair hair.\\n\\n\"Oh, I am dreaming. . . . I am dreaming!\" said Lupin, laughing. \"It\\'s a\\nnightmare! . . .\"\\n\\nExerting all his strength and all his will-power, he tried to make a\\nmovement, one movement, to drive away the vision.\\n\\nHe could not.\\n\\nAnd, suddenly, he remembered: the coffee! The taste of it . . . similar\\nto the taste of the coffee which he had drunk at Veldenz!\\n\\nHe gave a cry, made a last effort and fell back exhausted. But, in his\\ndelirium, he felt that the man was unfastening the top button of his\\npajama-jacket and baring his neck, felt that the man was raising his\\narm, saw that the hand was clutching the handle of a dagger, a little\\nsteel dagger similar to that which had struck Kesselbach, Chapman,\\nAltenheim and so many others. . . .\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nA few hours later, Lupin woke up, shattered with fatigue, with a\\nscorched palate.\\n\\nHe lay for several minutes collecting his thoughts and, suddenly,\\nremembering, made an instinctive defensive movement, as though he were\\nbeing attacked:\\n\\n\"Fool that I am!\" he cried, jumping out of bed. \"It was a nightmare, an\\nhallucination. It only needs a little reflection. Had it been \\'he,\\' had\\nit really been a man, in flesh and blood, who lifted his hand against me\\nlast night, he would have cut my throat like a rabbit\\'s. \\'He\\' doesn\\'t\\nhesitate. Let\\'s be logical. Why should he spare me? For the sake of my\\ngood looks? No, I have been dreaming, that\\'s all. . . .\"\\n\\nHe began to whistle and dressed himself, assuming the greatest calmness,\\nbut his brain never ceased working and his eyes sought about. . . .\\n\\nOn the floor, on the window-ledge, not a trace. As his room was on the\\nground-floor and as he slept with his window open, it was evident that\\nhis assailant would have entered that way.\\n\\nWell, he discovered nothing; and nothing either at the foot of the wall\\noutside, or on the gravel of the path that ran round the chalet.\\n\\n\"Still . . . still . . .\" he repeated, between his teeth. . . .\\n\\nHe called Octave:\\n\\n\"Where did you make the coffee which you gave me last night?\"\\n\\n\"At the castle, governor, like the rest of the things. There is no range\\nhere.\"\\n\\n\"Did you drink any of it?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Did you throw away what was left in the coffee-pot?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, governor. You said it was so bad. You only took a few\\nmouthfuls.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. Get the motor ready. We\\'re leaving.\"\\n\\nLupin was not the man to remain in doubt. He wanted to have a decisive\\nexplanation with Dolores. But, for this, he must first clear up certain\\npoints that seemed to him obscure and see Jean Doudeville who had sent\\nhim some rather curious information from Veldenz.\\n\\nHe drove, without stopping, to the grand-duchy, which he reached at two\\no\\'clock. He had an interview with Count de Waldemar, whom he asked, upon\\nsome pretext, to delay the journey of the delegates of the Regency to\\nBruggen. Then he went in search of Doudeville, in a tavern at Veldenz.\\n\\nDoudeville took him to another tavern, where he introduced him to a\\nshabbily-dressed little gentleman, Herr Stockli, a clerk in the\\ndepartment of births, deaths and marriages. They had a long\\nconversation. They went out together and all three passed stealthily\\nthrough the offices of the town-hall. At seven o\\'clock, Lupin dined and\\nset out again. At ten o\\'clock he arrived at Bruggen Castle and asked for\\nGeneviève, so that she might take him to Mrs. Kesselbach\\'s room.\\n\\nHe was told that Mlle. Ernemont had been summoned back to Paris by a\\ntelegram from her grandmother.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" he said. \"Could I see Mrs. Kesselbach?\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Kesselbach went straight to bed after dinner. She is sure to be\\nasleep.\"\\n\\n\"No, I saw a light in her boudoir. She will see me.\"\\n\\nHe did not even wait for Mrs. Kesselbach to send out an answer. He\\nwalked into the boudoir almost upon the maid\\'s heels, dismissed her and\\nsaid to Dolores:\\n\\n\"I have to speak to you, madame, on an urgent matter. . . . Forgive me\\n. . . I confess that my behavior must seem importunate. . . . But you\\nwill understand, I am sure. . . .\"\\n\\nHe was greatly excited and did not seem much disposed to put off the\\nexplanation, especially as, before entering the room, he thought he\\nheard a sound.\\n\\nYet Dolores was alone and lying down. And she said, in her tired voice:\\n\\n\"Perhaps we might . . . to-morrow. . . .\"\\n\\nHe did not answer, suddenly struck by a smell that surprised him in that\\nboudoir, a smell of tobacco. And, at once, he had the intuition, the\\ncertainty, that there was a man there, at the moment when he himself\\narrived, and that perhaps the man was there still, hidden somewhere.\\n. . .\\n\\nPierre Leduc? No, Pierre Leduc did not smoke. Then who?\\n\\nDolores murmured:\\n\\n\"Be quick, please.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, but first . . . would it be possible for you to tell me\\n. . . ?\"\\n\\nHe interrupted himself. What was the use of asking her? If there were\\nreally a man in hiding, would she be likely to tell?\\n\\nThen he made up his mind and, trying to overcome the sort of timid\\nconstraint that oppressed him at the sense of a strange presence, he\\nsaid, in a very low voice, so that Dolores alone should hear:\\n\\n\"Listen, I have learnt something . . . which I do not understand . . .\\nand which perplexes me greatly. You will answer me, will you not,\\nDolores?\"\\n\\nHe spoke her name with great gentleness and as though he were trying to\\nmaster her by the note of love and affection in his voice.\\n\\n\"What have you learnt?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"The register of births at Veldenz contains three names which are those\\nof the last descendants of the family of Malreich, which settled in\\nGermany. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you have told me all that. . . .\"\\n\\n\"You remember, the first name is Raoul de Malreich, better known under\\nhis _alias_ of Altenheim, the scoundrel, the swell hooligan, now dead\\n. . . murdered.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Next comes Louis de Malreich, the monster, this one, the terrible\\nmurderer who will be beheaded in a few days from now.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Then, lastly, Isilda, the mad daughter. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"So all that is quite positive, is it not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Lupin, leaning over her more closely than before, \"I have\\njust made an investigation which showed to me that the second of the\\nthree Christian names, or rather a part of the line on which it is\\nwritten, has at some time or other, been subjected to erasure. The line\\nis written over, in a new hand, with much fresher ink; but the writing\\nbelow is not quite effaced, so that. . . .\"\\n\\n\"So that . . . ?\" asked Mrs. Kesselbach, in a low voice.\\n\\n\"So that, with a good lens and particularly with the special methods\\nwhich I have at my disposal, I was able to revive some of the\\nobliterated syllables and, without any possibility of a mistake, in all\\ncertainty, to reconstruct the old writing. I then found not Louis de\\nMalreich, but . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t, don\\'t! . . .\"\\n\\nSuddenly shattered by the strain of her prolonged effort of resistance,\\nshe lay bent in two and, with her head in her hands, her shoulders\\nshaken with convulsive sobs, she wept.\\n\\nLupin looked for long seconds at this weak and listless creature, so\\npitifully helpless. And he would have liked to stop, to cease the\\ntorturing questions which he was inflicting upon her. But was it not to\\nsave her that he was acting as he did? And, to save her, was it not\\nnecessary that he should know the truth, however painful?\\n\\nHe resumed:\\n\\n\"Why that forgery?\"\\n\\n\"It was my husband,\" she stammered, \"it was my husband who did it. With\\nhis fortune, he could do everything; and he bribed a junior clerk to\\nhave the Christian name of the second child altered for him on the\\nregister.\"\\n\\n\"The Christian name and the sex,\" said Lupin.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Then,\" he continued, \"I am not mistaken: the original Christian name,\\nthe real one, was Dolores?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But why did your husband . . . ?\"\\n\\nShe whispered in a shame-faced manner, while the tears streamed down her\\ncheeks.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you understand?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"But think,\" she said, shuddering, \"I was the sister of Isilda, the mad\\nwoman, the sister of Altenheim, the ruffian. My husband--or rather my\\naffianced husband--would not have me remain that. He loved me. I loved\\nhim too, and I consented. He suppressed Dolores de Malreich on the\\nregister, he bought me other papers, another personality, another\\nbirth-certificate; and I was married in Holland under another maiden\\nname, as Dolores Amonti.\"\\n\\nLupin reflected for a moment and said, thoughtfully:\\n\\n\"Yes . . . yes . . . I understand. . . . But then Louis de Malreich does\\nnot exist; and the murderer of your husband, the murderer of your\\nbrother and sister, does not bear that name. . . . His name. . . .\"\\n\\nShe sprang to a sitting posture and, eagerly:\\n\\n\"His name! Yes, that is his name . . . yes, it is his name nevertheless.\\n. . . Louis de Malreich. . . . L. M. . . . Remember. . . . Oh, do not\\ntry to find out . . . it is the terrible secret. . . . Besides, what\\ndoes it matter? . . . They have the criminal. . . . He is the criminal.\\n. . . I tell you he is. Did he defend himself when I accused him, face\\nto face? Could he defend himself, under that name or any other? It is he\\n. . . it is he . . . He committed the murders. . . . He struck the\\nblows. . . . The dagger. . . . The steel dagger. . . . Oh, if I could\\nonly tell all I know! . . . Louis de Malreich. . . . If I could only\\n. . .\"\\n\\nShe fell back on the sofa in a fit of hysterical sobbing; and her hand\\nclutched Lupin\\'s and he heard her stammering, amid inarticulate words:\\n\\n\"Protect me . . . protect me. . . . You alone, perhaps. . . . Oh, do not\\nforsake me. . . . I am so unhappy! . . . Oh, what torture . . . what\\ntorture! . . . It is hell! . . .\"\\n\\nWith his free hand, he stroked her hair and forehead with infinite\\ngentleness; and, under his caress, she gradually relaxed her tense\\nnerves and became calmer and quieter.\\n\\nThen he looked at her again and long, long asked himself what there\\ncould be behind that fair, white brow, what secret was ravaging that\\nmysterious soul. She also was afraid. But of whom? Against whom was she\\nimploring him to protect her?\\n\\nOnce again, he was obsessed by the image of the man in black, by that\\nLouis de Malreich, the sinister and incomprehensible enemy, whose\\nattacks he had to ward off without knowing whence they came or even if\\nthey were taking place.\\n\\nHe was in prison, watched day and night. Tush! Did Lupin not know by his\\nown experience that there are beings for whom prison does not exist and\\nwho throw off their chains at the given moment? And Louis de Malreich\\nwas one of those.\\n\\nYes, there was some one in the Santé prison, in the condemned man\\'s\\ncell. But it might be an accomplice or some victim of Malreich . . .\\nwhile Malreich himself prowled around Bruggen Castle, slipped in under\\ncover of the darkness, like an invisible spectre, made his way into the\\nchalet in the park and, at night, raised his dagger against Lupin asleep\\nand helpless.\\n\\nAnd it was Louis de Malreich who terrorized Dolores, who drove her mad\\nwith his threats, who held her by some dreadful secret and forced her\\ninto silence and submission.\\n\\nAnd Lupin imagined the enemy\\'s plan: to throw Dolores, scared and\\ntrembling, into Pierre Leduc\\'s arms, to make away with him, Lupin, and\\nto reign in his place, over there, with the grand-duke\\'s power and\\nDolores\\'s millions.\\n\\nIt was a likely supposition, a certain supposition, which fitted in with\\nthe facts and provided a solution of all the problems.\\n\\n\"Of all?\" thought Lupin. \"Yes. . . . But then, why did he not kill me,\\nlast night, in the chalet? He had but to wish . . . _and he did not\\nwish_. One movement and I was dead. He did not make that movement. Why?\"\\n\\nDolores opened her eyes, saw him and smiled, with a pale smile:\\n\\n\"Leave me,\" she said:\\n\\nHe rose, with some hesitation. Should he go and see if the enemy was\\nbehind the curtain or hidden behind the dresses in a cupboard?\\n\\nShe repeated, gently:\\n\\n\"Go . . . I am so sleepy. . . .\"\\n\\nHe went away.\\n\\nBut, outside, he stopped behind some trees that formed a dark cluster in\\nfront of the castle. He saw a light in Dolores\\' boudoir. Then the light\\npassed into the bedroom. In a few minutes, all was darkness.\\n\\nHe waited. If the enemy was there, perhaps he would come out of the\\ncastle. . . .\\n\\nAn hour elapsed. . . . Two hours. . . . Not a sound. . . .\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing to be done,\" thought Lupin. \"Either he is burrowing in\\nsome corner of the castle . . . or else he has gone out by a door which\\nI cannot see from here. Unless the whole thing is the most ridiculous\\nsupposition on my part. . . .\"\\n\\nHe lit a cigarette and walked back to the chalet.\\n\\nAs he approached it, he saw, at some distance from him, a shadow that\\nappeared to be moving away.\\n\\nHe did not stir, for fear of giving the alarm.\\n\\nThe shadow crossed a path. By the light of the moon, he seemed to\\nrecognize the black figure of Malreich.\\n\\nHe rushed forward.\\n\\nThe shadow fled and vanished from sight.\\n\\n\"Come,\" he said, \"it shall be for to-morrow. And, this time. . . .\"\\n\\nLupin went to Octave\\'s, his chauffeur\\'s, room, woke him and said:\\n\\n\"Take the motor and go to Paris. You will be there by six o\\'clock in the\\nmorning. See Jacques Doudeville and tell him two things: first, to give\\nme news of the man under sentence of death; and secondly, as soon as the\\npost-offices open, to send me a telegram which I will write down for you\\nnow. . . .\"\\n\\nHe worded the telegram on a scrap of paper and added:\\n\\n\"The moment you have done that, come back, but this way, along the wall\\nof the park. Go now. No one must suspect your absence.\"\\n\\nLupin went to his own room, pressed the spring of his lantern and began\\nto make a minute inspection. \"It\\'s as I thought,\" he said presently.\\n\"Some one came here to-night, while I was watching beneath the window.\\nAnd, if he came, I know what he came for. . . . I was certainly right:\\nthings are getting warm. . . . The first time, I was spared. This time,\\nI may be sure of my little stab.\"\\n\\nFor prudence\\'s sake, he took a blanket, chose a lonely spot in the park\\nand spent the night under the stars.\\n\\nOctave was back by ten o\\'clock in the morning:\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right, governor. The telegram has been sent.\"\\n\\n\"Good. And is Louis de Malreich still in prison?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Doudeville passed his cell at the Santé last night as the warder\\nwas coming out. They talked together. Malreich is just the same, it\\nappears: silent as the grave. He is waiting.\"\\n\\n\"Waiting for what?\"\\n\\n\"The fatal hour of course. They are saying, at headquarters, that the\\nexecution will take place on the day after to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right, that\\'s all right,\" said Lupin. \"And one thing is\\nquite plain: he has not escaped.\"\\n\\nHe ceased to understand or even to look for the explanation of the\\nriddle, so clearly did he feel that the whole truth would soon be\\nrevealed to him. He had only to prepare his plan, for the enemy to fall\\ninto the trap.\\n\\n\"Or for me to fall into it myself,\" he thought, laughing.\\n\\nHe felt very gay, very free from care; and no fight had ever looked more\\npromising to him.\\n\\nA footman came from the castle with the telegram which he had told\\nDoudeville to send him and which the postman had just brought. He opened\\nit and put it in his pocket.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nA little before twelve o\\'clock, he met Pierre Leduc in one of the\\navenues and said, off-hand:\\n\\n\"I am looking for you . . . things are serious. . . . You must answer me\\nfrankly. Since you have been at the castle, have you ever seen a man\\nthere, besides the two German servants whom I sent in?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Think carefully. I\\'m not referring to a casual visitor. I mean a man\\nwho hides himself, a man whose presence you might have discovered or,\\nless than that, whose presence you might have suspected from some clue\\nor even by some intuition?\"\\n\\n\"No. . . . Have you . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Some one is hiding here . . . some one is prowling about. . . .\\nWhere? And who is it? And what is his object? I don\\'t know . . . but I\\nshall know. I already have a suspicion. Do you, on your side, keep your\\neyes open and watch. And, above all, not a word to Mrs. Kesselbach.\\n. . . It is no use alarming her. . . .\"\\n\\nHe went away.\\n\\nPierre Leduc, taken aback and upset, went back to the castle. On his\\nway, he saw a piece of blue paper on the edge of the lawn. He picked it\\nup. It was a telegram, not crumpled, like a piece of paper that had been\\nthrown away, but carefully folded: obviously lost.\\n\\nIt was addressed to \"Beauny,\" the name by which Lupin was known at\\nBruggen. And it contained these words:\\n\\n      \"We know the whole truth. Revelations impossible by\\n      letter. Will take train to-night. Meet me eight\\n      o\\'clock to-morrow morning Bruggen station.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent!\" said Lupin, who was watching Pierre Leduc\\'s movements from\\na neighboring coppice. \"Excellent! In two minutes from now, the young\\nidiot will have shown Dolores the telegram and told her all my fears.\\nThey will talk about it all day. And \\'the other one\\' will hear, \\'the\\nother one\\' will know, because he knows everything, because he lives in\\nDolores\\' own shadow and because Dolores is like a fascinated prey in his\\nhands. . . . And, to-night. . . .\"\\n\\nHe walked away humming to himself:\\n\\n\"To-night . . . to-night . . . we shall dance. . . . Such a waltz, my\\nboys! The waltz of blood, to the tune of the little nickel-plated\\ndagger! . . . We shall have some fun, at last! . . .\"\\n\\nHe reached the chalet, called to Octave, went to his room, flung himself\\non his bed, and said to the chauffeur:\\n\\n\"Sit down in that chair, Octave, and keep awake. Your master is going to\\ntake forty winks. Watch over him, you faithful servant.\"\\n\\nHe had a good sleep.\\n\\n\"Like Napoleon on the morning of Austerlitz,\" he said, when he woke up.\\n\\nIt was dinner-time. He made a hearty meal and then, while he smoked a\\ncigarette, inspected his weapons and renewed the charges of his two\\nrevolvers:\\n\\n\"Keep your powder dry and your sword sharpened, as my chum the Kaiser\\nsays. Octave!\"\\n\\nOctave appeared.\\n\\n\"Go and have your dinner at the castle, with the servants. Tell them you\\nare going to Paris to-night, in the motor.\"\\n\\n\"With you, governor?\"\\n\\n\"No, alone. And, as soon as dinner is over, make a start, ostensibly.\"\\n\\n\"But I am not to go to Paris. . . .\"\\n\\n\"No, remain outside the park, half a mile down the road, until I come.\\nYou will have a long wait.\"\\n\\nHe smoked another cigarette, went for a stroll, passed in front of the\\ncastle, saw a light in Dolores\\' rooms and then returned to the chalet.\\n\\nThere he took up a book. It was _The Lives of Illustrious Men_.\\n\\n\"There is one missing: the most illustrious of all. But the future will\\nput that right; and I shall have my Plutarch some day or other.\"\\n\\nHe read the life of Cæsar and jotted down a few reflections in the\\nmargin.\\n\\nAt half-past eleven, he went to his bedroom.\\n\\nThrough the open window, he gazed into the immense, cool night, all\\nastir with indistinct sounds. Memories rose to his lips, memories of\\nfond phrases which he had read or uttered; and he repeatedly whispered\\nDolores\\'s name, with the fervor of a stripling who hardly dares confide\\nto the silence the name of his beloved.\\n\\nHe left the window half open, pushed aside a table that blocked the way,\\nand put his revolvers under his pillow. Then, peacefully, without\\nevincing the least excitement, he got into bed, fully dressed as he was,\\nand blew out the candle.\\n\\n_And his fear began._\\n\\nIt was immediate. No sooner did he feel the darkness around him than his\\nfear began!\\n\\n\"Damn it all!\" he cried.\\n\\nHe jumped out of bed, took his weapons and threw them into the passage:\\n\\n\"My hands, my hands alone! Nothing comes up to the grip of my hands!\"\\n\\nHe went to bed again. Darkness and silence, once more. And, once more,\\nhis fear. . . .\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe village clock struck twelve. . . .\\n\\nLupin thought of the foul monster who, outside, at a hundred yards, at\\nfifty yards from where he lay, was trying the sharp point of his dagger:\\n\\n\"Let him come, let him come?\" whispered Lupin, shuddering. \"Then the\\nghosts will vanish. . . .\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOne o\\'clock, in the village. . . .\\n\\nAnd minutes passed, endless minutes, minutes of fever and anguish. . . .\\nBeads of perspiration stood at the roots of his hair and trickled down\\nhis forehead; and he felt as though his whole frame were bathed in a\\nsweat of blood. . . .\\n\\nTwo o\\'clock. . . .\\n\\nAnd now, somewhere, quite close, a hardly perceptible sound stirred, a\\nsound of leaves moving . . . but different from the sound of leaves\\nmoving in the night breeze. . . .\\n\\nAs Lupin had foreseen, he was at once pervaded by an immense calm. All\\nhis adventurous being quivered with delight. The struggle was at hand,\\nat last!\\n\\nAnother sound grated under the window, more plainly this time, but still\\nso faint that it needed Lupin\\'s trained ear to distinguish it.\\n\\nMinutes, terrifying minutes. . . . The darkness was impenetrable. No\\nlight of star or moon relieved it.\\n\\nAnd, suddenly, without hearing anything, he _knew_ that the man was in\\nthe room.\\n\\nAnd the man walked toward the bed. He walked as a ghost walks, without\\ndisplacing the air of the room, without shaking the objects which he\\ntouched.\\n\\nBut, with all his instinct, with all his nervous force, Lupin saw the\\nmovements of the enemy and guessed the very sequence of his ideas.\\n\\nHe himself did not budge, but remained propped against the wall, almost\\non his knees, ready to spring.\\n\\nHe felt that the figure was touching, feeling the bed-clothes, to find\\nthe spot at which it must strike. Lupin heard its breath. He even\\nthought that he heard the beating of its heart. And he noticed with\\npride that his own heart beat no louder than before . . . whereas the\\nheart of the other . . . oh, yes, he could hear it now, that disordered,\\nmad heart, knocking, like a clapper of a bell, against the cavity of the\\nchest!\\n\\nThe hand of the other rose. . . .\\n\\nA second, two seconds. . . .\\n\\nWas he hesitating? Was he once more going to spare his adversary?\\n\\nAnd Lupin, in the great silence, said:\\n\\n\"But strike! Why don\\'t you strike?\"\\n\\nA yell of rage. . . . The arm fell as though moved by a spring.\\n\\nThen came a moan.\\n\\nLupin had caught the arm in mid-air at the level of the wrist. . . .\\nAnd, leaping out of bed, tremendous, irresistible, he clutched the man\\nby the throat and threw him.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThat was all. There was no struggle. There was no possibility even of a\\nstruggle. The man lay on the floor, nailed, pinned by two steel rivets,\\nwhich were Lupin\\'s hands. And there was not a man in the world strong\\nenough to release himself from that grip.\\n\\nAnd not a word. Lupin uttered none of those phrases in which his\\nmocking humor usually delighted. He had no inclination to speak. The\\nmoment was too solemn.\\n\\nHe felt no vain glee, no victorious exaltation. In reality, he had but\\none longing, to know who was there: Louis de Malreich, the man sentenced\\nto death, or another? Which was it?\\n\\nAt the risk of strangling the man, he squeezed the throat a little more\\n. . . and a little more . . . and a little more still. . . .\\n\\nAnd he felt that all the enemy\\'s strength, all the strength that\\nremained to him, was leaving him. The muscles of the arm relaxed and\\nbecame lifeless. The hand opened and dropped the dagger.\\n\\nThen, free to move as he pleased, with his adversary\\'s life hanging in\\nthe terrible clutch of his fingers, he took his pocket-lantern with one\\nhand, laid his finger on the spring, without pressing, and brought it\\nclose to the man\\'s face.\\n\\nHe had only to press the spring to wish to know and he would know.\\n\\nFor a second, he enjoyed his power. A flood of emotion upheaved him. The\\nvision, of his triumph dazzled him. Once again, superbly, heroically, he\\nwas the master.\\n\\nHe switched on the light. The face of the monster came into view.\\n\\nLupin gave a shriek of terror.\\n\\nDolores Kesselbach!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nARSÈNE LUPIN\\'S THREE MURDERS\\n\\n\\nA cyclone passed through Lupin\\'s brain, a hurricane in which roars of\\nthunder, gusts of wind, squalls of all the distraught elements were\\ntumultuously unchained in the chaotic night.\\n\\nAnd great flashes of lightning shot through the darkness. And, by the\\ndazzling gleam of those lightning-flashes, Lupin, scared, shaken with\\nthrills, convulsed with horror, saw and tried to understand.\\n\\nHe did not move, clinging to the enemy\\'s throat, as if his stiffened\\nfingers were no longer able to release their grip. Besides, although he\\nnow _knew_, he had not, so to speak, the exact feeling that it was\\nDolores. It was still the man in black, Louis de Malreich, the foul\\nbrute of the darkness; and that brute he held and did not mean to let\\ngo.\\n\\nBut the truth rushed upon the attack of his mind and of his\\nconsciousness; and, conquered, tortured with anguish, he muttered:\\n\\n\"Oh, Dolores! . . . Dolores! . . .\"\\n\\nHe at once saw the excuse: it was madness. She was mad. The sister of\\nAltenheim and Isilda, the daughter of the last of the Malreichs, of the\\ndemented mother, of the drunken father, was herself mad. A strange\\nmadwoman, mad with every appearance of sanity, but mad nevertheless,\\nunbalanced, brain-sick, unnatural, truly monstrous.\\n\\nThat he most certainly understood! It was homicidal madness. Under the\\nobsession of an object toward which she was drawn automatically, she\\nkilled, thirsting for blood, unconsciously, infernally.\\n\\nShe killed because she wanted something, she killed in self-defence, she\\nkilled because she had killed before. But she killed also and especially\\nfor the sake of killing. Murder satisfied sudden and irresistible\\nappetites that arose in her. At certain seconds in her life, in certain\\ncircumstances, face to face with this or that being who had suddenly\\nbecome the foe, her arm had to strike.\\n\\nAnd she struck, drunk with rage, ferociously, frenziedly.\\n\\nA strange madwoman, not answerable for her murders, and yet so lucid in\\nher blindness, so logical in her mental derangement, so intelligent in\\nher absurdity! What skill, what perseverance, what cunning contrivances,\\nat once abominable and admirable!\\n\\nAnd Lupin, in a rapid view, with prodigious keenness of outlook, saw the\\nlong array of bloodthirsty adventures and guessed the mysterious paths\\nwhich Dolores had pursued.\\n\\nHe saw her obsessed and possessed by her husband\\'s scheme, a scheme\\nwhich she evidently understood only in part. He saw her, on her side,\\nlooking for that same Pierre Leduc whom her husband was seeking, looking\\nfor him in order to marry him and to return, as queen, to that little\\nrealm of Veldenz from which her parents had been ignominiously driven.\\n\\nAnd he saw her at the Palace Hotel, in the room of her brother,\\nAltenheim, at the time when she was supposed to be at Monte Carlo. He\\nsaw her, for days together, spying upon her husband, creeping along the\\nwalls, one with the darkness, undistinguishable and unseen in her\\nshadowy disguise.\\n\\nAnd, one night, she found Mr. Kesselbach fastened up . . . and she\\nstabbed him.\\n\\nAnd, in the morning, when on the point of being denounced by the\\nfloor-waiter . . . she stabbed him.\\n\\nAnd, an hour later, when on the point of being denounced by Chapman, she\\ndragged him to her brother\\'s room . . . and stabbed him.\\n\\nAll this pitilessly, savagely, with diabolical skill.\\n\\nAnd, with the same skill, she communicated by telephone with her two\\nmaids, Gertrude and Suzanne, both of whom had arrived from Monte Carlo,\\nwhere one of them had enacted the part of her mistress. And Dolores,\\nresuming her feminine attire, discarding the fair wig that altered her\\nappearance beyond recognition, went down to the ground-floor, joined\\nGertrude at the moment when the maid entered the hotel and pretended\\nherself to have just arrived, all ignorant of the tragedy that awaited\\nher.\\n\\nAn incomparable actress, she played the part of the wife whose life is\\nshattered. Every one pitied her. Every one wept for her. Who could have\\nsuspected her?\\n\\nAnd then came the war with him, Lupin, that barbarous contest, that\\nunparalleled contest which she waged, by turns, against M. Lenormand and\\nPrince Sernine, spending her days stretched on her sofa, ill and\\nfainting, but her nights on foot, scouring the roads indefatigable and\\nterrible.\\n\\nAnd the diabolical contrivances: Gertrude and Suzanne, frightened and\\nsubdued accomplices, both of them serving her as emissaries, disguising\\nthemselves to represent her, perhaps, as on the day when old Steinweg\\nwas carried off by Baron Altenheim, in the middle of the Palais de\\nJustice.\\n\\nAnd the series of murders: Gourel drowned; Altenheim, her brother,\\nstabbed. Oh, the implacable struggle in the underground passages of the\\nVilla des Glycines, the invisible work performed by the monster in the\\ndark: how clear it all appeared to-day!\\n\\nAnd it was she who tore off his mask as Prince Sernine, she who betrayed\\nhim to the police, she who sent him to prison, she who thwarted all his\\nplans, spending her millions to win the battle.\\n\\nAnd then events followed faster: Suzanne and Gertrude disappeared, dead,\\nno doubt! Steinweg, assassinated! Isilda, the sister, assassinated!\\n\\n\"Oh, the ignominy, the horror of it!\" stammered Lupin, with a start of\\nrevulsion and hatred.\\n\\nHe execrated her, the abominable creature. He would have liked to crush\\nher, to destroy her. And it was a stupefying sight, those two beings,\\nclinging to each other, lying motionless in the pale dawn that began to\\nmingle with the shades of the night.\\n\\n\"Dolores. . . . Dolores. . . .\" he muttered, in despair.\\n\\nHe leapt back, terror-stricken, wild-eyed. What was it? What was that?\\nWhat was that hideous feeling of cold which froze his hands?\\n\\n\"Octave! Octave?\" he shouted, forgetting that the chauffeur was not\\nthere.\\n\\nHelp, he needed help, some one to reassure him and assist him. He\\nshivered with fright. Oh, that coldness, that coldness of death which he\\nhad felt! Was it possible? . . . Then, during those few tragic minutes,\\nwith his clenched fingers, he had. . . .\\n\\nViolently, he forced himself to look. Dolores did not stir.\\n\\nHe flung himself on his knees and drew her to him.\\n\\nShe was dead.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nHe remained for some seconds a prey to a sort of numbness in which his\\ngrief seemed to be swallowed up. He no longer suffered. He no longer\\nfelt rage nor hatred nor emotion of any kind . . . nothing but a stupid\\nprostration, the sensation of a man who has received a blow with a club\\nand who does not know if he is still alive, if he is thinking, or if he\\nis the sport of a nightmare.\\n\\nNevertheless, it seemed to him that an act of justice had taken place,\\nand it did not for a second occur to him that it was he who had taken\\nlife. No, it was not he. It was outside him and his will. It was\\ndestiny, inexorable destiny that had accomplished the work of equity by\\nslaying the noxious beast.\\n\\nOutside, the birds were singing. Life was recommencing under the old\\ntrees, which the spring was preparing to bring into bud. And Lupin,\\nwaking from his torpor, felt gradually welling up within him an\\nindefinable and ridiculous compassion for the wretched woman, odious,\\ncertainly, abject and twenty times criminal, but so young still and now\\n. . . dead.\\n\\nAnd he thought of the tortures which she must have undergone in her\\nlucid moments, when reason returned to the unspeakable madwoman and\\nbrought the sinister vision of her deeds.\\n\\n\"Protect me. . . . I am so unhappy!\" she used to beg.\\n\\nIt was against herself that she asked to be protected, against her\\nwild-beast instincts, against the monster that dwelt within her and\\nforced her to kill, always to kill.\\n\\n\"Always?\" Lupin asked himself.\\n\\nAnd he remembered the night, two days since, when, standing over him,\\nwith her dagger raised against the enemy who had been harassing her for\\nmonths, against the indefatigable enemy who had run her to earth after\\neach of her crimes, he remembered that, on that night, she had not\\nkilled. And yet it would have been easy: the enemy lay lifeless and\\npowerless. One blow and the implacable struggle was over. No, she had\\nnot killed, she too had given way to feelings stronger than her own\\ncruelty, to mysterious feelings of pity, of sympathy, of admiration for\\nthe man who had so often mastered her.\\n\\nNo, she had not killed, that time. And now, by a really terrifying\\nvicissitude of fate, it was he who had killed her.\\n\\n\"I have taken life!\" he thought, shuddering from head to foot. \"These\\nhands have killed a living being; and that creature is Dolores! . . .\\nDolores! . . . Dolores! . . .\"\\n\\nHe never ceased repeating her name, her name of sorrow, and he never\\nceased staring at her, a sad, lifeless thing, harmless now, a poor hunk\\nof flesh, with no more consciousness than a little heap of withered\\nleaves or a little dead bird by the roadside.\\n\\nOh! how could he do other than quiver with compassion, seeing that of\\nthose two, face to face, he was the murderer, and she, who was no more,\\nthe victim?\\n\\n\"Dolores! . . . Dolores! . . . Dolores! . . .\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe daylight found Lupin seated beside the dead woman, remembering and\\nthinking, while his lips, from time to time, uttered the disconsolate\\nsyllables:\\n\\n\"Dolores! . . . Dolores! . . .\"\\n\\nHe had to act, however, and, in the disorder of his ideas, he did not\\nknow how to act nor with what act to begin:\\n\\n\"I must close her eyes first,\" he said.\\n\\nThe eyes, all empty, filled only with death, those beautiful\\ngold-spangled eyes, had still the melancholy softness that gave them\\ntheir charm. Was it possible that those eyes were the eyes of a monster?\\nIn spite of himself and in the face of the implacable reality, Lupin was\\nnot yet able to blend into one single being those two creatures whose\\nimages remained so distinct at the back of his brain.\\n\\nHe stooped swiftly, lowered the long, silky eyelids, and covered the\\npoor distorted face with a veil.\\n\\nThen it seemed to him that Dolores was farther away and that the man in\\nblack was really there, this time, in his dark clothes, in his\\nmurderer\\'s disguise.\\n\\nHe now ventured to touch her, to feel in her clothes. In an inside\\npocket were two pocket-books. He took one of them and opened it. He\\nfound first a letter signed by Steinweg, the old German. It contained\\nthe following lines:\\n\\n      \"Should I die before being able to reveal the terrible\\n      secret, let it be known that the murderer of my\\n      friend Kesselbach is his wife, whose real name is\\n      Dolores de Malreich, sister to Altenheim and sister to\\n      Isilda.\\n\\n      \"The initials L. and M. relate to her. Kesselbach\\n      never, in their private life, called his wife Dolores,\\n      which is the name of sorrow, but Letitia, which\\n      denotes joy. L. M.--Letitia de Malreich--were the\\n      initials inscribed on all the presents which he used\\n      to give her, for instance, on the cigarette-case which\\n      was found at the Palace Hotel and which belonged to\\n      Mrs. Kesselbach. She had contracted the smoking-habit\\n      on her travels.\\n\\n      \"Letitia! She was indeed the joy of his life for four\\n      years, four years of lies and hypocrisy, in which she\\n      prepared the death of the man who loved her so well\\n      and who trusted her so whole-heartedly.\\n\\n      \"Perhaps I ought to have spoken at once. I had not the\\n      courage, in memory of my old friend Kesselbach, whose\\n      name she bore.\\n\\n      \"And then I was afraid. . . . On the day when I\\n      unmasked her, at the Palais de Justice, I read my doom\\n      in her eyes.\\n\\n      \"Will my weakness save me?\"\\n\\n\"Him also,\" thought Lupin, \"him also she killed! . . . Why, of course,\\nhe knew too much! . . . The initials . . . that name, Letitia . . . the\\nsecret habit of smoking!\"\\n\\nAnd he remembered the previous night, that smell of tobacco in her room.\\n\\nHe continued his inspection of the first pocket-book. There were scraps\\nof letters, in cipher, no doubt handed to Dolores by her accomplices, in\\nthe course of their nocturnal meetings. There were also addresses on\\nbits of paper, addresses of milliners and dressmakers, but addresses\\nalso of low haunts, of common hotels. . . . And names . . . twenty,\\nthirty names . . . queer names: Hector the Butcher, Armand of Grenelle,\\nthe Sick Man . . .\\n\\nBut a photograph caught Lupin\\'s eye. He looked at it. And, at once, as\\nthough shot from a spring, dropping the pocket-book, he bolted out of\\nthe room, out of the chalet and rushed into the park.\\n\\nHe had recognized the portrait of Louis de Malreich, the prisoner at the\\nSanté!\\n\\nNot till then, not till that exact moment did he remember: the execution\\nwas to take place next day.\\n\\nAnd, as the man in black, as the murderer was none other than Dolores\\nKesselbach, Louis de Malreich\\'s name was really and truly Leon Massier\\nand he was innocent!\\n\\nInnocent? But the evidence found in his house, the Emperor\\'s letters,\\nall, all the things that accused him beyond hope of denial, all those\\nincontrovertible proofs?\\n\\nLupin stopped for a second, with his brain on fire:\\n\\n\"Oh,\" he cried, \"I shall go mad, I, too! Come, though, I must act . . .\\nthe sentence is to be executed . . . to-morrow . . . to-morrow at break\\nof day.\"\\n\\nHe looked at his watch:\\n\\n\"Ten o\\'clock. . . . How long will it take me to reach Paris? Well . . .\\nI shall be there presently . . . yes, presently, I must. . . . And this\\nvery evening I shall take measures to prevent. . . . But what measures?\\nHow can I prove his innocence? . . . How prevent the execution? Oh,\\nnever mind! Once I am there, I shall find a way. My name is not Lupin\\nfor nothing! . . . Come on! . . .\"\\n\\nHe set off again at a run, entered the castle and called out:\\n\\n\"Pierre! Pierre! . . . Has any one seen M. Pierre Leduc? . . . Oh,\\nthere you are! . . . Listen. . . .\"\\n\\nHe took him on one side and jerked out, in imperious tones:\\n\\n\"Listen, Dolores is not here. . . . Yes, she was called away on urgent\\nbusiness . . . she left last night in my motor. . . . I am going too.\\n. . . Don\\'t interrupt, not a word! . . . A second lost means irreparable\\nharm. . . . You, send away all the servants, without any explanation.\\nHere is money. In half an hour from now, the castle must be empty. And\\nlet no one enter it until I return. . . . Not you either, do you\\nunderstand? . . . I forbid you to enter the castle. . . . I\\'ll explain\\nlater . . . serious reasons. Here, take the key with you. . . . Wait for\\nme in the village. . . .\"\\n\\nAnd once more, he darted away.\\n\\nFive minutes later, he was with Octave. He jumped into the car:\\n\\n\"Paris!\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe journey was a real race for life or death. Lupin, thinking that\\nOctave was not driving fast enough, took the steering-wheel himself and\\ndrove at a furious, break-neck speed. On the road, through the villages,\\nalong the crowded streets of the towns they rushed at sixty miles an\\nhour. People whom they nearly upset roared and yelled with rage: the\\nmeteor was far away, was out of sight.\\n\\n\"G--governor,\" stammered Octave, livid with dismay, \"we shall be stuck!\"\\n\\n\"You, perhaps, the motor, perhaps; but I shall arrive!\" said Lupin.\\n\\nHe had a feeling as though it were not the car that was carrying him,\\nbut he carrying the car and as though he were cleaving space by dint of\\nhis own strength, his own will-power. Then what miracle could prevent\\nhis arriving, seeing that his strength was inexhaustible, his will-power\\nunbounded?\\n\\n\"I shall arrive because I have got to arrive,\" he repeated.\\n\\nAnd he thought of the man who would die, if he did not arrive in time to\\nsave him, of the mysterious Louis de Malreich, so disconcerting with his\\nstubborn silence and his expressionless face.\\n\\nAnd amid the roar of the road, under the trees whose branches made a\\nnoise as of furious waves, amid the buzzing of his thoughts, Lupin, all\\nthe same, strove to set up an hypothesis. And this hypothesis became\\ngradually more defined, logical, probable, certain, he said to himself,\\nnow that he knew the hideous truth about Dolores and saw all the\\nresources and all the odious designs of that crazy mind:\\n\\n\"Yes, it was she who contrived that most terrible plot against Malreich.\\nWhat was it she wanted? To marry Pierre Leduc, whom she had bewitched,\\nand to become the sovereign of the little principality from which she\\nhad been banished. The object was attainable, within reach of her hand.\\nThere was one sole obstacle. . . . I, Lupin, who, for weeks and weeks,\\npersistently barred her road; I, whom she encountered after every\\nmurder; I, whose perspicacity she dreaded; I, who would never lay down\\nmy arms before I had discovered the culprit and found the letters stolen\\nfrom the Emperor. . . . Well, the culprit should be Louis de Malreich,\\nor rather, Leon Massier. Who was this Leon Massier? Did she know him\\nbefore her marriage? Had she been in love with him? It is probable; but\\nthis, no doubt, we shall never know. One thing is certain, that she was\\nstruck by the resemblance to Leon Massier in figure and stature which\\nshe might attain by dressing up like him, in black clothes, and putting\\non a fair wig. She must have noticed the eccentric life led by that\\nlonely man, his nocturnal expeditions, his manner of walking in the\\nstreets and of throwing any who might follow him off the scent. And it\\nwas in consequence of these observations and in anticipation of possible\\neventualities that she advised Mr. Kesselbach to erase the name of\\nDolores from the register of births and to replace it by the name of\\nLouis, so that the initials might correspond with those of Leon Massier.\\n. . . The moment arrived at which she must act; and thereupon she\\nconcocted her plot and proceeded to put it into execution. Leon lived in\\nthe Rue Delaizement. She ordered her accomplices to take up their\\nquarters in the street that backed on to it. And she herself told me the\\naddress of Dominique the head-waiter, and put me on the track of the\\nseven scoundrels, knowing perfectly well that, once on the track, I was\\nbound to follow it to the end, that is to say, beyond the seven\\nscoundrels, till I came up with their leader, the man who watched them\\nand who commanded them, the man in black, Leon Massier, Louis de\\nMalreich. . . . As a matter of fact, I came up with the seven scoundrels\\nfirst. Then what would happen? Either I should be beaten or we should\\nall destroy one another, as she must have hoped, that night in the Rue\\ndes Vignes. In either case Dolores would have been rid of me. But what\\nreally happened was this: I captured the seven scoundrels. Dolores fled\\nfrom the Rue des Vignes. I found her in the Broker\\'s shed. She sent me\\nafter Leon Massier, that is to say, Louis de Malreich. I found in his\\nhouse the Emperor\\'s letters, _which she herself had placed there_, and I\\ndelivered him to justice and I revealed the secret communication, _which\\nshe herself had caused to be made_, between the two coach-houses, and I\\nproduced all the evidence _which she herself had prepared_, and I\\nproved, by means of documents _which she herself had forged_, that Leon\\nMassier had stolen the social status of Leon Massier and that his real\\nname was Louis de Malreich. . . . And Louis de Malreich was sentenced to\\ndeath. . . . And Dolores de Malreich, victorious at last, safe from all\\nsuspicion once the culprit was discovered, released from her infamous\\nand criminal past, her husband dead, her brother dead, her sister dead,\\nher two maids dead, Steinweg dead, delivered by me from her accomplices,\\nwhom I handed over to Weber all packed up, delivered, lastly, from\\nherself by me, who was sending the innocent man whom she had substituted\\nfor herself to the scaffold, Dolores de Malreich, triumphant, rich with\\nthe wealth of her millions and loved by Pierre Leduc, Dolores de\\nMalreich would sit upon the throne of her native grand-duchy. . . . Ah,\"\\ncried Lupin, beside himself with excitement, \"that man shall not die! I\\nswear it as I live: he shall not die!\"\\n\\n\"Look out, governor,\" said Octave, scared, \"we are near the town now.\\n. . . the outskirts . . . the suburbs. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What shall I care?\"\\n\\n\"But we shall topple over. . . . And the pavement is greasy . . . we are\\nskidding. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Never mind.\"\\n\\n\"Take care. . . . Look ahead. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"A tram-car, at the turn. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Let it stop!\"\\n\\n\"Do slow down, governor!\"\\n\\n\"Never!\"\\n\\n\"But we have no room to pass!\"\\n\\n\"We shall get through.\"\\n\\n\"We can\\'t get through.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we can.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Lord!\"\\n\\nA crash . . . outcries. . . . The motor had run into the tram-car,\\ncannoned against a fence, torn down ten yards of planking and, lastly,\\nsmashed itself against the corner of a slope.\\n\\n\"Driver, are you disengaged?\"\\n\\nLupin, lying flat on the grass of the slope, had hailed a taxi-cab.\\n\\nHe scrambled to his feet, gave a glance at his shattered car and the\\npeople crowding round to Octave\\'s assistance and jumped into the cab:\\n\\n\"Go to the Ministry of the Interior, on the Place Beauvau . . . Twenty\\nfrancs for yourself. . . .\"\\n\\nHe settled himself in the taxi and continued:\\n\\n\"No, no, he shall not die! No, a thousand times no, I will not have that\\non my conscience! It is bad enough to have been tricked by a woman and\\nto have fallen into the snare like a schoolboy. . . . That will do! No\\nmore blunders for me! I have had that poor wretch arrested. . . . I have\\nhad him sentenced to death. . . . I have brought him to the foot of the\\nscaffold . . . but he shall not mount it! . . . Anything but that! If he\\nmounts the scaffold, there will be nothing left for me but to put a\\nbullet through my head.\"\\n\\nThey were approaching the toll-house. He leant out:\\n\\n\"Twenty francs more, driver, if you don\\'t stop.\"\\n\\nAnd he shouted to the officials:\\n\\n\"Detective-service!\"\\n\\nThey passed through.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t slow down, don\\'t slow down, hang it!\" roared Lupin. \"Faster!\\n. . . Faster still! Are you afraid of running over the old ladies? Never\\nmind about them! I\\'ll pay the damage!\"\\n\\nIn a few minutes, they were at the Ministry of the Interior. Lupin\\nhurried across the courtyard and ran up the main staircase. The\\nwaiting-room was full of people. He scribbled on a sheet of paper,\\n\"Prince Sernine,\" and, hustling a messenger into a corner, said:\\n\\n\"You know me, don\\'t you? I\\'m Lupin. I procured you this berth; a snug\\nretreat for your old age, eh? Only, you\\'ve got to show me in at once.\\nThere, take my name through. That\\'s all I ask of you. The premier will\\nthank you, you may be sure of that . . . and so I will. . . . But, hurry\\nyou fool! Valenglay is expecting me. . . .\"\\n\\nTen seconds later, Valenglay himself put his head through the door of\\nhis room and said:\\n\\n\"Show the prince in.\"\\n\\nLupin rushed into the room, slammed the door and, interrupting the\\npremier, said:\\n\\n\"No, no set phrases, you can\\'t arrest me. . . . It would mean ruining\\nyourself and compromising the Emperor. . . . No, it\\'s not a question of\\nthat. Look here. Malreich is innocent. . . . I have discovered the real\\ncriminal. . . . It\\'s Dolores Kesselbach. She is dead. Her body is down\\nthere. I have undeniable proofs. There is no doubt possible. It was\\nshe. . . .\"\\n\\nHe stopped. Valenglay seemed not to understand.\\n\\n\"But, look here, Monsieur le President, we must save Malreich. . . .\\nOnly think . . . a judicial error! . . . An innocent man guillotined!\\n. . . Give your orders . . . say you have fresh information . . .\\nanything you please . . . but, quick, there is no time to lose. . . .\"\\n\\nValenglay looked at him attentively, then went to a table, took up a\\nnewspaper and handed it to him, pointing his finger at an article as he\\ndid so.\\n\\nLupin cast his eye at the head-line and read:\\n\\n      \"EXECUTION OF THE MONSTER\"\\n\\n      \"Louis de Malreich underwent the death-penalty this\\n      morning. . . .\"\\n\\nHe read no more. Thunderstruck, crushed, he fell into the premier\\'s\\nchair with a moan of despair. . . .\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nHow long he remained like that he could not say. When he was outside\\nagain, he remembered a great silence and then Valenglay bending over him\\nand sprinkling water on his forehead. He remembered, above all, the\\npremier\\'s hushed voice whispering:\\n\\n\"Listen . . . you won\\'t say anything about this will you? Innocent,\\nperhaps, I don\\'t say not. . . . But what is the use of revelations, of a\\nscandal? A judicial error can have serious consequences. Is it worth\\nwhile? . . . A rehabilitation? For what purpose? He was not even\\nsentenced under his own name. It is the name of Malreich which is held\\nup to public execration . . . the name of the real criminal, as it\\nhappens. . . . So . . .\"\\n\\nAnd, pushing Lupin gradually toward the door, he said:\\n\\n\"So go. . . . Go back there. . . . Get rid of the corpse. . . . And let\\nnot a trace remain, eh? Not the slightest trace of all this business.\\n. . . I can rely on you, can I not?\"\\n\\nAnd Lupin went back. He went back like a machine, because he had been\\ntold to do so and because he had no will left of his own.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nHe waited for hours at the railway-station. Mechanically, he ate his\\ndinner, took a ticket and settled down in a compartment.\\n\\nHe slept badly. His brain was on fire between nightmares and half-waking\\nintervals in which he tried to make out why Malreich had not defended\\nhimself:\\n\\n\"He was a madman . . . surely . . . half a madman. . . . He must have\\nknown her formerly . . . and she poisoned his life . . . she drove him\\ncrazy. . . . So he felt he might as well die. . . . Why defend himself?\"\\n\\nThe explanation only half satisfied him, and he promised himself sooner\\nor later to clear up the riddle and to discover the exact part which\\nMassier had played in Dolores\\' life. But what did it matter for the\\nmoment? One fact alone stood out clearly, which was Massier\\'s madness,\\nand he repeated, persistently:\\n\\n\"He was a madman . . . Massier was undoubtedly mad. Besides, all those\\nMassiers . . . a family of madmen. . . .\"\\n\\nHe raved, mixing up names in his enfeebled brain.\\n\\nBut, on alighting at Bruggen Station, in the cool, moist air of the\\nmorning, his consciousness revived. Things suddenly assumed a different\\naspect. And he exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Well, after all, it was his own look-out! He had only to protest. . . .\\nI accept no responsibility. . . . It was he who committed suicide. . . .\\nHe was only a dumb actor in the play. . . . He has gone under. . . . I\\nam sorry. . . . But it can\\'t be helped!\"\\n\\nThe necessity for action stimulated him afresh. Wounded, tortured by\\nthat crime of which he knew himself to be the author for all that he\\nmight say, he nevertheless looked to the future:\\n\\n\"Those are the accidents of war,\" he said. \"Don\\'t let us think about it.\\nNothing is lost. On the contrary! Dolores was the stumbling-block, since\\nPierre Leduc loved her. Dolores is dead. Therefore Pierre Leduc belongs\\nto me. And he shall marry Geneviève, as I have arranged! And he shall\\nreign! And I shall be the master! And Europe, Europe is mine!\"\\n\\nHe worked himself up, reassured, full of sudden confidence, and made\\nfeverish gestures as he walked along the road, whirling an imaginary\\nsword, the sword of the leader whose will is law, who commands and\\ntriumphs:\\n\\n\"Lupin, you shall be king! You shall be king, Arsène Lupin!\"\\n\\nHe inquired in the village of Bruggen and heard that Pierre Leduc had\\nlunched yesterday at the inn. Since then, he had not been seen.\\n\\n\"Oh?\" asked Lupin. \"Didn\\'t he sleep here?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"But where did he go after his lunch?\"\\n\\n\"He took the road to the castle.\"\\n\\nLupin walked away in some surprise. After all, he had told the young man\\nto lock the doors and not to return after the servants had gone.\\n\\nHe at once received a proof that Pierre had disobeyed him: the park\\ngates were open.\\n\\nHe went in, hunted all over the castle, called out. No reply.\\n\\nSuddenly, he thought of the chalet. Who could tell? Perhaps Pierre\\nLeduc, worrying about the woman he loved and driven by an intuition, had\\ngone to look for her in that direction. And Dolores\\' corpse was there!\\n\\nGreatly alarmed, Lupin began to run.\\n\\nAt first sight, there seemed to be no one in the chalet.\\n\\n\"Pierre! Pierre!\" he cried.\\n\\nHearing no sound, he entered the front passage and the room which he had\\noccupied.\\n\\nHe stopped short, rooted to the threshold.\\n\\nAbove Dolores\\' corpse, hung Pierre Leduc, with a rope round his neck,\\ndead.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nLupin impatiently pulled himself together from head to foot. He refused\\nto yield to a single gesture of despair. He refused to utter a single\\nviolent word. After the cruel blows which fate had dealt him, after\\nDolores\\' crimes and death, after Massier\\'s execution, after all those\\ndisturbances and catastrophes, he felt the absolute necessity of\\nretaining all his self-command. If not, his brain would undoubtedly give\\nway. . . .\\n\\n\"Idiot!\" he said, shaking his fist at Pierre Leduc. \"You great idiot,\\ncouldn\\'t you wait? In ten years we should have had Alsace-Lorraine\\nagain!\"\\n\\nTo relieve his mind, he sought for words to say, for attitudes; but his\\nideas escaped him and his head seemed on the point of bursting.\\n\\n\"Oh, no, no!\" he cried. \"None of that, thank you! Lupin mad too! No, old\\nchap! Put a bullet through your head, if you like; and, when all is\\nsaid, I don\\'t see any other way out. But Lupin drivelling, wheeled about\\nin a bath-chair . . . no! Style, old fellow, finish in style!\"\\n\\nHe walked up and down, stamping his feet and lifting his knees very\\nhigh, as certain actors do when feigning madness. And he said:\\n\\n\"Swagger, my lad, swagger! The eyes of the gods are upon you! Lift up\\nyour head! Pull in your stomach, hang it! Throw out your chest! . . .\\nEverything is breaking up around you. What do you care? . . . It\\'s the\\nfinal disaster, I\\'ve played my last card, a kingdom in the gutter, I\\'ve\\nlost Europe, the whole world ends in smoke. . . . Well . . . and what of\\nit? Laugh, laugh! Be Lupin, or you\\'re in the soup. . . . Come, laugh!\\nLouder than that, louder, louder! That\\'s right! . . . Lord, how funny it\\nall is! Dolores, old girl, a cigarette!\"\\n\\nHe bent down with a grin, touched the dead woman\\'s face, tottered for a\\nsecond and fell to the ground unconscious.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAfter lying for an hour, he came to himself and stood up. The fit of\\nmadness was over; and, master of himself, with relaxed nerves, serious\\nand silent, he considered the position.\\n\\nHe felt that the time had come for the irrevocable decisions that\\ninvolve a whole existence. His had been utterly shattered, in a few\\ndays, under the assault of unforeseen catastrophes, rushing up, one\\nafter the other, at the very moment when he thought his triumph assured.\\nWhat should he do? Begin again? Build up everything again? He had not\\nthe courage for it. What then?\\n\\nThe whole morning, he roamed tragically about the park and gradually\\nrealized his position in all its slightest details. Little by little,\\nthe thought of death enforced itself upon him with inflexible rigor.\\n\\nBut, whether he decided to kill himself or to live, there was first of\\nall a series of definite acts which he was obliged to perform. And these\\nacts stood out clearly in his brain, which had suddenly become quite\\ncool.\\n\\nThe mid-day Angelus rang from the church-steeple.\\n\\n\"To work!\" he said, firmly.\\n\\nHe returned to the chalet in a very calm frame of mind, went to his\\nroom, climbed on a stool, and cut the rope by which Pierre Leduc was\\nhanging:\\n\\n\"You poor devil!\" he said. \"You were doomed to end like that, with a\\nhempen tie around your neck. Alas, you were not made for greatness: I\\nought to have foreseen that and not hooked my fortune to a rhymester!\"\\n\\nHe felt in the young man\\'s clothes and found nothing. But, remembering\\nDolores\\' second pocket-book, he took it from the pocket where he had\\nleft it.\\n\\nHe gave a start of surprise. The pocket-book contained a bundle of\\nletters whose appearance was familiar to him; and he at once recognized\\nthe different writings.\\n\\n\"The Emperor\\'s letters!\" he muttered, slowly. \"The old chancellor\\'s\\nletters! The whole bundle which I myself found at Leon Massier\\'s and\\nwhich I handed to Count von Waldemar! . . . How did it happen? . . .\\nDid she take them in her turn from that blockhead of a Waldemar?\" And,\\nsuddenly, slapping his forehead, \"Why, no, the blockhead is myself.\\nThese are the real letters! She kept them to blackmail the Emperor when\\nthe time came. And the others, the ones which I handed over, are copies,\\nforged by herself, of course, or by an accomplice, and placed where she\\nknew that I should find them. . . . And I played her game for her, like\\na mug! By Jove, when women begin to interfere . . . !\"\\n\\nThere was only a piece of pasteboard left in the pocket-book, a\\nphotograph. He looked at it. It was his own.\\n\\n\"Two photographs . . . Massier and I . . . the two she loved best, no\\ndoubt . . . For she loved me. . . . A strange love, built up of\\nadmiration for the adventurer that I am, for the man who, by himself,\\nput away the seven scoundrels whom she had paid to break my head! A\\nstrange love! I felt it throbbing in her the other day, when I told her\\nmy great dream of omnipotence. Then, really, she had the idea of\\nsacrificing Pierre Leduc and subjecting her dream to mine. If the\\nincident of the mirror had not taken place, she would have been subdued.\\nBut she was afraid. I had my hand upon the truth. My death was necessary\\nfor her salvation and she decided upon it.\" He repeated several times,\\npensively, \"And yet she loved me. . . . Yes, she loved me, as others\\nhave loved me . . . others to whom I have brought ill-luck also. . . .\\nAlas, all those who love me die! . . . And this one died too, strangled\\nby my hand. . . . What is the use of living? . . . What is the use of\\nliving?\" he asked again, in a low voice. \"Is it not better to join\\nthem, all those women who have loved me . . . and who have died of their\\nlove . . . Sonia, Raymonde, Clotilde, Destange, Miss Clarke? . . .\"\\n\\nHe laid the two corpses beside each other, covered them with the same\\nsheet, sat down at a table and wrote:\\n\\n      \"I have triumphed over everything and I am beaten. I\\n      have reached the goal and I have fallen. Fate is too\\n      strong for me. . . . And she whom I loved is no more.\\n      I shall die also.\"\\n\\nAnd he signed his name:\\n\\n      \"ARSÈNE LUPIN.\"\\n\\nHe sealed the letter and slipped it into a bottle which he flung through\\nthe window, on the soft ground of a flower-border.\\n\\nNext, he made a great pile on the floor with old newspapers, straw and\\nshavings, which he went to fetch in the kitchen. On the top of it he\\nemptied a gallon of petrol. Then he lit a candle and threw it among the\\nshavings.\\n\\nA flame at once arose and other flames leapt forth, quick, glowing,\\ncrackling.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s clear out,\" said Lupin. \"The chalet is built of wood, it will all\\nflare up like a match. And, by the time they come from the village,\\nbreak down the gates and run to this end of the park, it will be too\\nlate. They will find ashes, the remains of two charred corpses and,\\nclose at hand, my farewell letter in a bottle. . . . Good-bye, Lupin!\\nBury me simply, good people, without superfluous state . . . a poor\\nman\\'s funeral . . . No flowers, no wreaths. . . . Just a humble cross\\nand a plain epitaph; \\'Here lies Arsène Lupin, adventurer.\\'\"\\n\\nHe made for the park wall, climbed over it, and turning round, saw the\\nflames soaring up to the sky. . . .\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nHe wandered back toward Paris on foot, bowed down by destiny, with\\ndespair in his heart. And the peasants were amazed at the sight of this\\ntraveller who paid with bank-notes for his fifteen-penny meals.\\n\\nThree foot-pads attacked him one evening in the forest. He defended\\nhimself with his stick and left them lying for dead. . . .\\n\\nHe spent a week at an inn. He did not know where to go. . . . What was\\nhe to do? What was there for him to cling to? He was tired of life. He\\ndid not want to live. . . .\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Is that you?\"\\n\\nMme. Ernemont stood in her little sitting-room in the villa at Garches,\\ntrembling, scared and livid, staring at the apparition that faced her.\\n\\nLupin! . . . It was Lupin.\\n\\n\"You!\" she said. \"You! . . . But the papers said . . .\"\\n\\nHe smiled sadly:\\n\\n\"Yes, I am dead.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then . . . well, then . . .\" she said, naïvely.\\n\\n\"You mean that, if I am dead, I have no business here. Believe me, I\\nhave serious reasons, Victoire.\"\\n\\n\"How you have changed!\" she said, in a voice full of pity.\\n\\n\"A few little disappointments. . . . However, that\\'s over. . . . Tell\\nme, is Geneviève in?\"\\n\\nShe flew at him, in a sudden rage:\\n\\n\"You leave her alone, do you hear? Geneviève? You want to see Geneviève,\\nto take her back? Ah, this time I shall not let her out of my sight! She\\ncame back tired, white as a sheet, nervous; and the color has hardly yet\\nreturned to her cheeks. You shall leave her alone, I swear you shall.\"\\n\\nHe pressed his hand hard on the old woman\\'s shoulder:\\n\\n\"I _will_--do you understand?--I _will_ speak to her.\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"I mean to speak to her.\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\nHe pushed her about. She drew herself up and, crossing her arms:\\n\\n\"You shall pass over my dead body first, do you hear? The child\\'s\\nhappiness lies in this house and nowhere else. . . . With all your ideas\\nof money and rank, you would only make her miserable. Who is this Pierre\\nLeduc of yours? And that Veldenz of yours? Geneviève a grand-duchess!\\nYou are mad. That\\'s no life for her! . . . You see, after all, you have\\nthought only of yourself in this matter. It was your power, your fortune\\nyou wanted. The child you don\\'t care a rap about. Have you so much as\\nasked yourself if she loved your rascally grand-duke? Have you asked\\nyourself if she loved anybody? No, you just pursued your object, that is\\nall, at the risk of hurting Geneviève and making her unhappy for the\\nrest of her life. . . . Well, I won\\'t have it! What she wants is a\\nsimple, honest existence, led in the broad light of day; and that is\\nwhat you can\\'t give her. Then what are you here for?\"\\n\\nHe seemed to waver, but, nevertheless, he murmured in a low voice and\\nvery sadly:\\n\\n\"It is impossible that I should never see her again, it is impossible\\nthat I should not speak to her. . . .\"\\n\\n\"She believes you dead.\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I do not want! I want her to know the truth. It is\\na torture to me to think that she looks upon me as one who is no more.\\nBring her to me, Victoire.\"\\n\\nHe spoke in a voice so gentle and so distressed that she was utterly\\nmoved, and said:\\n\\n\"Listen. . . . First of all, I want to know. . . . It depends upon what\\nyou intend to say to her. . . . Be frank, my boy. . . . What do you want\\nwith Geneviève?\"\\n\\nHe said, gravely:\\n\\n\"I want to say this: \\'Geneviève, I promised your mother to give you\\nwealth, power, a fairy-like existence. And, on the day when I had\\nattained my aim, I would have asked you for a little place, not very far\\nfrom you. Rich and happy, you would have forgotten--yes, I am sure of\\nit--you would have forgotten who I am, or rather who I was.\\nUnfortunately, fate has been too strong for me. I bring you neither\\nwealth nor power. And it is I, on the contrary, who have need of you.\\nGeneviève, will you help me?\\'\"\\n\\n\"To do what?\" asked the old woman, anxiously.\\n\\n\"To live. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" she said. \"Has it come to that, my poor boy? . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he answered, simply, without any affectation of sorrow, \"yes, it\\nhas come to that. Three human beings are just dead, killed by me, killed\\nby my hands. The burden of the memory is more than I can bear. I am\\nalone. For the first time in my life, I need help. I have the right to\\nask that help of Geneviève. And her duty is to give it to me. . . . If\\nnot . . .\"\\n\\n\"If not . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"Then all is over.\"\\n\\nThe old woman was silent, pale and quivering with emotion. She once more\\nfelt all her affection for him whom she had fed at her breast and who\\nstill and in spite of all remained \"her boy.\" She asked:\\n\\n\"What do you intend to do with her?\"\\n\\n\"We shall go abroad. We will take you with us, if you like to come.\\n. . .\"\\n\\n\"But you forget . . . you forget. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"Your past. . . .\"\\n\\n\"She will forget it too. She will understand that I am no longer the man\\nI was, that I do not wish to be.\"\\n\\n\"Then, really, what you wish is that she should share your life, the\\nlife of Lupin?\"\\n\\n\"The life of the man that I shall be, of the man who will work so that\\nshe may be happy, so that she may marry according to her inclination. We\\nwill settle down in some nook or other. We will struggle together, side\\nby side. And you know what I am capable of. . . .\"\\n\\nShe repeated, slowly, with her eyes fixed on his:\\n\\n\"Then, really, you wish her to share Lupin\\'s life?\"\\n\\nHe hesitated a second, hardly a second, and declared, plainly:\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I wish it, I have the right.\"\\n\\n\"You wish her to abandon all the children to whom she has devoted\\nherself, all this life of work which she loves and which is essential to\\nher happiness?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I wish it, it is her duty.\"\\n\\nThe old woman opened the window and said:\\n\\n\"In that case, call her.\"\\n\\nGeneviève was in the garden, sitting on a bench. Four little girls were\\ncrowding round her. Others were playing and running about.\\n\\nHe saw her full-face. He saw her grave, smiling eyes. She held a flower\\nin her hand and plucked the petals one by one and gave explanations to\\nthe attentive and eager children. Then she asked them questions. And\\neach answer was rewarded with a kiss to the pupil.\\n\\nLupin looked at her long, with infinite emotion and anguish. A whole\\nleaven of unknown feelings fermented within him. He had a longing to\\npress that pretty girl to his breast, to kiss her and tell her how he\\nrespected and loved her. He remembered the mother, who died in the\\nlittle village of Aspremont, who died of grief.\\n\\n\"Call her,\" said Victoire. \"Why don\\'t you call her?\"\\n\\nHe sank into a chair and stammered:\\n\\n\"I can\\'t. . . . I can\\'t do it. . . . I have not the right. . . . It is\\nimpossible. . . . Let her believe me dead. . . . That is better. . . .\"\\n\\nHe wept, his shoulders shaking with sobs, his whole being overwhelmed\\nwith despair, swollen with an affection that arose in him, like those\\nbackward flowers which die on the very day of their blossoming.\\n\\nThe old woman knelt down beside him and, in a trembling voice, asked:\\n\\n\"She is your daughter, is she not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she is my daughter.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my poor boy!\" she said, bursting into tears. \"My poor boy! . . .\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEPILOGUE\\n\\nTHE SUICIDE\\n\\n\\n\"To horse!\" said the Emperor.\\n\\nHe corrected himself, on seeing the magnificent ass which they brought\\nhim:\\n\\n\"To donkey, rather! Waldemar, are you sure this animal is quiet to ride\\nand drive?\"\\n\\n\"I will answer for him as I would for myself, Sire,\" declared the count.\\n\\n\"In that case, I feel safe,\" said the Emperor, laughing. And, turning to\\nthe officers with him, \"Gentlemen, to horse!\"\\n\\nThe market-place of the village of Capri was crowded with sight-seers,\\nkept back by a line of Italian carabiniers, and, in the middle, all the\\ndonkeys of the place, which had been requisitioned to enable the Emperor\\nto go over that island of wonders.\\n\\n\"Waldemar,\" said the Emperor, taking the head of the cavalcade, \"what do\\nwe begin with?\"\\n\\n\"With Tiberius\\'s Villa, Sire.\"\\n\\nThey rode under a gateway and then followed a roughly-paved path, rising\\ngradually to the eastern promontory of the island.\\n\\nThe Emperor laughed and enjoyed himself and good-humoredly chaffed the\\ncolossal Count von Waldemar, whose feet touched the ground on either\\nside of the unfortunate donkey borne down under his weight.\\n\\nIn three-quarters of an hour, they arrived first at Tiberius\\'s Leap, an\\nenormous rock, a thousand feet high, from which the tyrant caused his\\nvictims to be hurled into the sea. . . .\\n\\nThe Emperor dismounted, walked up to the hand-rail and took a glance at\\nthe abyss. Then he went on foot to the ruins of Tiberius\\'s Villa, where\\nhe strolled about among the crumbling halls and passages.\\n\\nHe stopped for a moment.\\n\\nThere was a glorious view of the point of Sorrento and over the whole\\nisland of Capri. The glowing blue of the sea outlined the beautiful\\ncurve of the bay; and cool perfumes mingled with the scent of the\\ncitron-trees.\\n\\n\"The view is finer still, Sire,\" said Waldemar, \"from the hermit\\'s\\nlittle chapel, at the summit.\"\\n\\n\"Let us go to it.\"\\n\\nBut the hermit himself descended by a steep path. He was an old man,\\nwith a hesitating gait and a bent back. He carried the book in which\\ntravellers usually write down their impressions.\\n\\nHe placed the book on a stone seat.\\n\\n\"What am I write?\" asked the Emperor.\\n\\n\"Your name, Sire, and the date of your visit . . . and anything you\\nplease.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor took the pen which the hermit handed him and bent down to\\nwrite.\\n\\n\"Take care, Sire, take care!\"\\n\\nShouts of alarm . . . a great crash from the direction of the chapel.\\n. . . The Emperor turned round. He saw a huge rock come rolling down\\nupon him like a whirlwind.\\n\\nAt the same moment, he was seized round the body by the hermit and flung\\nto a distance of ten yards away.\\n\\nThe rock struck against the stone seat where the Emperor had been\\nstanding a quarter of a second before and smashed the seat into\\nfragments. But for the hermit, the Emperor would have been killed.\\n\\nHe gave him his hand and said, simply:\\n\\n\"Thank you.\"\\n\\nThe officers flocked round him.\\n\\n\"It\\'s nothing, gentlemen. . . . We have escaped with a fright . . .\\nthough it was a fine fright, I confess. . . . All the same, but for the\\nintervention of this worthy man . . .\"\\n\\nAnd, going up to the hermit:\\n\\n\"What is your name, my friend?\"\\n\\nThe hermit had kept his head concealed in his hood. He pushed it back an\\ninch or so and, in a very low voice, so as to be heard by none but the\\nEmperor, he said:\\n\\n\"The name of a man, Sire, who is very pleased that you have shaken him\\nby the hand.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor gave a start and stepped back. Then, at once controlling\\nhimself:\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said to the officers, \"I will ask you to go up to the\\nchapel. More rocks can break loose; and it would perhaps be wise to warn\\nthe authorities of the island. You will join me later. I want to thank\\nthis good man.\"\\n\\nHe walked away, accompanied by the hermit. When they were alone, he\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"You! Why?\"\\n\\n\"I had to speak to you, Sire. If I had asked for an audience . . . would\\nyou have granted my request? I preferred to act directly and I intended\\nto make myself known while Your Imperial Majesty was signing the book,\\nwhen that stupid accident . . .\"\\n\\n\"Well?\" said the Emperor.\\n\\n\"The letters which I gave Waldemar to hand to you, Sire, are forgeries.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor made a gesture of keen annoyance:\\n\\n\"Forgeries? Are you sure?\"\\n\\n\"Absolutely sure, Sire.\"\\n\\n\"Yet that Malreich . . .\"\\n\\n\"Malreich was not the culprit.\"\\n\\n\"Then who was?\"\\n\\n\"I must beg Your Imperial Majesty to treat my answer as secret and\\nconfidential. The real culprit was Mrs. Kesselbach.\"\\n\\n\"Kesselbach\\'s own wife?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire. She is dead now. It was she who made or caused to be made\\nthe copies which are in your possession. She kept the real letters.\"\\n\\n\"But where are they?\" exclaimed the Emperor. \"That is the important\\nthing! They must be recovered at all costs! I attach the greatest value\\nto those letters. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Here they are, Sire.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor had a moment of stupefaction. He looked at Lupin, looked at\\nthe letters, then at Lupin again and pocketed the bundle without\\nexamining it.\\n\\nClearly, this man was puzzling him once more. Where did this scoundrel\\nspring from who, possessing so terrible a weapon, handed it over like\\nthat, generously, unconditionally? It would have been so easy for him to\\nkeep the letters and to make such use of them as he pleased! No, he had\\ngiven his promise and he was keeping his word.\\n\\nAnd the Emperor thought of all the astounding things which that man had\\ndone.\\n\\n\"The papers said that you were dead,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire. In reality, I am dead. And the police of my country, glad to\\nbe rid of me, have buried the charred and unrecognizable remains of my\\nbody.\"\\n\\n\"Then you are free?\"\\n\\n\"As I always have been.\"\\n\\n\"And nothing attaches you to anything?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, Sire.\"\\n\\n\"In that case . . .\"\\n\\nThe Emperor hesitated and then, explicitly:\\n\\n\"In that case, enter my service. I offer you the command of my private\\npolice. You shall be the absolute master. You shall have full power,\\neven over the other police.\"\\n\\n\"No, Sire.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"I am a Frenchman.\"\\n\\nThere was a pause. The Emperor was evidently pleased with the answer. He\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"Still, as you say that no link attaches you . . .\"\\n\\n\"That is, one, Sire, which nothing can sever.\" And he added, laughing,\\n\"I am dead as a man, but alive as a Frenchman. I am sure that Your\\nImperial Majesty will understand.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor took a few steps up and down. Then he said:\\n\\n\"I should like to pay my debt, however. I heard that the negotiations\\nfor the grand-duchy of Veldenz were broken off. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire, Pierre Leduc was an imposter. He is dead.\"\\n\\n\"What can I do for you? You have given me back those letters. . . . You\\nhave saved my life. . . . What can I do?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, Sire.\"\\n\\n\"You insist upon my remaining your debtor?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sire.\"\\n\\nThe Emperor gave a last glance at that strange man who set himself up in\\nhis presence as his equal. Then he bowed his head slightly and walked\\naway without another word.\\n\\n\"Aha, Majesty, I\\'ve caught you this time!\" said Lupin, following him\\nwith his eyes. And, philosophically, \"No doubt it\\'s a poor revenge . . .\\nand would rather have recovered Alsace-Lorraine. . . . But still . . .\"\\n\\nHe interrupted himself and stamped his foot on the ground:\\n\\n\"You confounded Lupin! Will you never change, will you always remain\\nhateful and cynical to the last moment of your existence? Be serious,\\nhang it all! The time has come, now or never, to be serious!\"\\n\\nHe climbed the path that leads to the chapel and stopped at the place\\nwhere the rock had broken loose. He burst out laughing:\\n\\n\"It was a good piece of work and His Imperial Majesty\\'s officers did not\\nknow what to make of it. But how could they guess that I myself loosened\\nthat rock, that, at the last moment, I gave the decisive blow of the\\npick-axe and that the aforesaid rock rolled down the path which I had\\nmade between it and . . . an emperor whose life I was bent on saving?\"\\n\\nHe sighed:\\n\\n\"Ah, Lupin, what a complex mind you have! All that trouble because you\\nhad sworn that this particular Majesty should shake you by the hand! A\\nlot of good it has done you! \\'An Emperor\\'s hand five fingers has, no\\nmore,\\' as Victor Hugo might have said.\"\\n\\nHe entered the chapel and, with a special key, opened the low door of a\\nlittle sacristy. On a heap of straw, lay a man, with his hands and legs\\nbound and a gag in his mouth.\\n\\n\"Well, my friend, the hermit,\" said Lupin, \"it wasn\\'t so very long, was\\nit? Twenty-four hours at the most. . . . But I have worked jolly hard on\\nyour behalf! Just think, you have saved the Emperor\\'s life! Yes, old\\nchap. You are the man who saved the Emperor\\'s life. I have made your\\nfortune, that\\'s what I\\'ve done. They\\'ll build a cathedral for you and\\nput up a statue to you when you\\'re dead and gone. Here, take your\\nthings.\"\\n\\nThe hermit, nearly dead with hunger, staggered to his feet. Lupin\\nquickly put on his own clothes and said:\\n\\n\"Farewell, O worthy and venerable man. Forgive me for this little upset.\\nAnd pray for me. I shall need it. Eternity is opening its gate wide to\\nme. Farewell.\"\\n\\nHe stood for a few moments on the threshold of the chapel. It was the\\nsolemn moment at which one hesitates, in spite of everything, before the\\nterrible end of all things. But his resolution was irrevocable and,\\nwithout further reflection, he darted out, ran down the slope, crossed\\nthe level ground of Tiberius\\'s Leap and put one leg over the hand-rail:\\n\\n\"Lupin, I give you three minutes for play-acting. \\'What\\'s the good?\\' you\\nwill say. \\'There is nobody here.\\' Well . . . and what about you? Can\\'t\\nyou act your last farce for yourself? By Jove, the performance is worth\\nit. . . . _Arsène Lupin_, heroic comedy in eighty scenes. . . . The\\ncurtain rises on the death-scene . . . and the principal part is played\\nby Lupin in person. . . . \\'Bravo, Lupin!\\' . . . Feel my heart, ladies\\nand gentlemen . . . seventy beats to the minute. . . . And a smile on my\\nlips. . . . \\'Bravo, Lupin! Oh, the rogue, what cheek he has!\\' . . .\\nWell, jump, my lord. . . . Are you ready? It\\'s the last adventure, old\\nfellow. No regrets? Regrets? What for, heavens above? My life was\\nsplendid. Ah, Dolores, Dolores, if you had not come into it, abominable\\nmonster that you were! . . . . . . And you, Malreich, why did you not\\nspeak? . . . And you, Pierre Leduc. . . . Here I am! . . . My three dead\\nfriends, I am about to join you. . . . Oh, Geneviève, my dear Geneviève!\\n. . . Here, have you done, you old play-actor? . . . Right you are!\\nRight you are! I\\'m coming. . . .\"\\n\\nHe pulled his other leg over, looked down the abyss at the dark and\\nmotionless sea and, raising his head:\\n\\n\"Farewell, immortal and thrice-blessed nature! _Moriturus te salutat!_\\nFarewell, all that is beautiful on earth! Farewell, splendor of things.\\nFarewell, life!\"\\n\\nHe flung kisses to space, to the sky, to the sun. . . . Then, folding\\nhis arms, he took the leap.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSidi-bel-Abbes. The barracks of the Foreign Legion. An adjutant sat\\nsmoking and reading his newspaper in a small, low-ceilinged room.\\n\\nNear him, close to the window opening on the yard, two great devils of\\nnon-commissioned officers were jabbering in guttural French, mixed with\\nTeutonic phrases.\\n\\nThe door opened. Some one entered. It was a slightly-built man, of\\nmedium height, smartly-dressed.\\n\\nThe adjutant rose, glared angrily at the intruder and growled:\\n\\n\"I say, what on earth is the orderly up to? . . . And you, sir, what do\\nyou want?\"\\n\\n\"Service.\"\\n\\nThis was said frankly, imperiously.\\n\\nThe two non-coms burst into a silly laugh. The man looked at them\\naskance.\\n\\n\"In other words, you wish to enlist in the Legion?\" asked the adjutant.\\n\\n\"Yes, but on one condition.\"\\n\\n\"Conditions, by Jove! What conditions?\"\\n\\n\"That I am not left mouldering here. There is a company leaving for\\nMorocco. I\\'ll join that.\"\\n\\nOne of the non-coms gave a fresh chuckle and was heard to say:\\n\\n\"The Moors are in for a bad time. The gentleman\\'s enlisting.\"\\n\\n\"Silence!\" cried the man, \"I don\\'t stand being laughed at.\"\\n\\nHis voice sounded harsh and masterful.\\n\\nThe non-com, a brutal-looking giant, retorted:\\n\\n\"Here, recruity, you\\'d better be careful how you talk to me, or . . .\"\\n\\n\"Or what?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll get something you won\\'t like, that\\'s all!\"\\n\\nThe man went up to him, took him round the waist, swung him over the\\nledge of the window and pitched him into the yard.\\n\\nThen he said to the other:\\n\\n\"Go away.\"\\n\\nThe other went away.\\n\\nThe man at once returned to the adjutant and said:\\n\\n\"Lieutenant, pray be so good as to tell the major that Don Luis\\nPerenna, a Spanish grandee and a Frenchman at heart, wishes to take\\nservice in the Foreign Legion. Go, my friend.\"\\n\\nThe flabbergasted adjutant did not move.\\n\\n\"Go, my friend, and go at once. I have no time to waste.\"\\n\\nThe adjutant rose, looked at his astounding visitor with a bewildered\\neye and went out in the tamest fashion.\\n\\nThen Lupin lit a cigarette and, sitting down in the adjutant\\'s chair,\\nsaid, aloud:\\n\\n\"As the sea refused to have anything to say to me, or rather as I, at\\nthe last moment, refused to have anything to say to the sea, we\\'ll go\\nand see if the bullets of the Moors are more compassionate. And, in any\\ncase, it will be a smarter finish. . . . Face the enemy, Lupin, and all\\nfor France! . . .\"\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nCHAPTER I. A NOVEL CASE\\n\\n\\n“Talking of sudden disappearances the one you mention of Hannah in that\\nLeavenworth case of ours, is not the only remarkable one which has come\\nunder my direct notice. Indeed, I know of another that in some respects,\\nat least, surpasses that in points of interest, and if you will promise\\nnot to inquire into the real names of the parties concerned, as the\\naffair is a secret, I will relate you my experience regarding it.”\\n\\nThe speaker was Q, the rising young detective, universally acknowledged\\nby us of the force as the most astute man for mysterious and\\nunprecedented cases, then in the bureau, always and of course excepting\\nMr. Gryce; and such a statement from him could not but arouse our\\ndeepest curiosity. Drawing up, then, to the stove around which we\\nwere sitting in lazy enjoyment of one of those off-hours so dear to\\na detective’s heart, we gave with alacrity the required promise; and\\nsettling himself back with the satisfied air of a man who has a good\\nstory to tell that does not entirely lack certain points redounding to\\nhis own credit, he began:\\n\\nI was one Sunday morning loitering at the ----- Precinct Station, when\\nthe door opened and a respectable-looking middle-aged woman came in,\\nwhose agitated air at once attracted my attention. Going up to her, I\\nasked her what she wanted.\\n\\n“A detective,” she replied, glancing cautiously about on the faces of\\nthe various men scattered through the room. “I don’t wish anything said\\nabout it, but a girl disappeared from our house last night, and”--she\\nstopped here, her emotion seeming to choke her--“and I want some one to\\nlook her up,” she went on at last with the most intense emphasis.\\n\\n“A girl? what kind of a girl; and what house do you mean when you say\\nour house?”\\n\\nShe looked at me keenly before replying. “You are a young man,” said\\nshe; “isn’t there some one here more responsible than yourself that I\\ncan talk to?”\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders and beckoned to Mr. Gryce who was just then\\npassing. She at once seemed to put confidence in him. Drawing him aside,\\nshe whispered a few low eager words which I could not hear. He listened\\nnonchalantly for a moment but suddenly made a move which I knew\\nindicated strong and surprised interest, though from his face--but you\\nknow what Gryce’s face is. I was about to walk off, convinced he had\\ngot hold of something he would prefer to manage himself, when the\\nSuperintendent came in.\\n\\n“Where is Gryce?” asked he; “tell him I want him.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce heard him and hastened forward. As he passed me, he whispered,\\n“Take a man and go with this woman; look into matters and send me word\\nif you want me; I will be here for two hours.”\\n\\nI did not need a second permission. Beckoning to Harris, I reapproached\\nthe woman. “Where do you come from,” said I, “I am to go back with you\\nand investigate the affair it seems.”\\n\\n“Did he say so?” she asked, pointing to Mr. Gryce who now stood with his\\nback to us busily talking with the Superintendent.\\n\\nI nodded, and she at once moved towards the door. “I come from No.----\\nSecond Avenue: Mr. Blake’s house,” she whispered, uttering a name so\\nwell known, I at once understood Mr. Gryce’s movement of sudden interest\\n“A girl--one who sewed for us--disappeared last night in a way to\\nalarm us very much. She was taken from her room--” “Yes,” she cried\\nvehemently, seeing my look of sarcastic incredulity, “taken from her\\nroom; she never went of her own accord; and she must be found if I spend\\nevery dollar of the pittance I have laid up in the bank against my old\\nage.”\\n\\nHer manner was so intense, her tone so marked and her words so vehement,\\nI at once and naturally asked if the girl was a relative of hers that\\nshe felt her abduction so keenly.\\n\\n“No,” she replied, “not a relative, but,” she went on, looking every way\\nbut in my face, “a very dear friend--a--a--protegee, I think they call\\nit, of mine; I--I--She must be found,” she again reiterated.\\n\\nWe were by this time in the street.\\n\\n“Nothing must be said about it,” she now whispered, catching me by the\\narm. “I told him so,” nodding back to the building from which we had\\njust issued, “and he promised secrecy. It can be done without folks\\nknowing anything about it, can’t it?”\\n\\n“What?” I asked.\\n\\n“Finding the girl.”\\n\\n“Well,” said I, “we can tell you better about that when we know a few\\nmore of the facts. What is the girl’s name and what makes you think she\\ndidn’t go out of the house-door of her own accord?”\\n\\n“Why, why, everything. She wasn’t the person to do it; then the looks of\\nher room, and--They all got out of the window,” she cried suddenly, “and\\nwent away by the side gate into ------ Street.”\\n\\n“They? Who do you mean by they?”\\n\\n“Why, whoever they were who carried her off.”\\n\\nI could not suppress the “bah!” that rose to my lips. Mr. Gryce might\\nhave been able to, but I am not Gryce.\\n\\n“You don’t believe,” said she, “that she was carried off?”\\n\\n“Well, no,” said I, “not in the sense you mean.”\\n\\nShe gave another nod back to the police station now a block or so\\ndistant. “He did’nt seem to doubt it at all.”\\n\\nI laughed. “Did you tell him you thought she had been taken off in this\\nway?”\\n\\n“Yes, and he said, ‘Very likely.’ And well he might, for I heard the men\\ntalking in her room, and--”\\n\\n“You heard men talking in her room--when?”\\n\\n“O, it must have been as late as half-past twelve. I had been asleep and\\nthe noise they made whispering, woke me.”\\n\\n“Wait,” I said, “tell me where her room is, hers and yours.”\\n\\n“Hers is the third story back, mine the front one on the same floor.”\\n\\n“Who are you?” I now inquired. “What position do you occupy in Mr.\\nBlake’s house?”\\n\\n“I am the housekeeper.”\\n\\nMr. Blake was a bachelor.\\n\\n“And you were wakened last night by hearing whispering which seemed to\\ncome from this girl’s room.”\\n\\n“Yes, I at first thought it was the folks next door,--we often hear them\\nwhen they are unusually noisy,--but soon I became assured it came from\\nher room; and more astonished than I could say,--She is a good girl,”\\n she broke in, suddenly looking at me with hotly indignant eyes,\\n“a--a--as good a girl as this whole city can show; don’t you dare, any\\nof you, to hint at anything else o--”\\n\\n“Come, come,” I said soothingly, a little ashamed of my too\\ncommunicative face, “I haven’t said anything, we will take it for\\ngranted she is as good as gold, go on.”\\n\\nThe woman wiped her forehead with a hand that trembled like a leaf.\\n“Where was I?” said she. “O, I heard voices and was surprised and got\\nup and went to her door. The noise I made unlocking my own must have\\nstartled her, for all was perfectly quiet when I got there. I waited a\\nmoment, then I turned the knob and called her: she did not reply and I\\ncalled again. Then she came to the door, but did not unlock it. ‘What is\\nit?’ she asked. ‘O,’ said I, ‘I thought I heard talking here and I was\\nfrightened,’ ‘It must have been next door,’ said she. I begged pardon\\nand went back to my room. There was no more noise, but when in the\\nmorning we broke into her room and found her gone, the window open and\\nsigns of distress and struggle around, I knew I had not been mistaken;\\nthat there were men with her when I went to her door, and that they had\\ncarried her off--”\\n\\nThis time I could not restrain myself.\\n\\n“Did they drop her out of the window?” I inquired.\\n\\n“O,” said she, “we are building an extension, and there is a ladder\\nrunning up to the third floor, and it was by means of that they took\\nher.”\\n\\n“Indeed! she seems at least to have been a willing victim,” I remarked.\\n\\nThe woman clutched my arm with a grip like iron. “Don’t you believe it,”\\n gasped she, stopping me in the street where we were. “I tell you if what\\nI say is true, and these burglars or whatever they were, did carry her\\noff, it was an agony to her, an awful, awful thing that will kill her if\\nit has not done so already. You don’t know what you are talking about,\\nyou never saw her--”\\n\\n“Was she pretty,” I asked, hurrying the woman along, for more than one\\npasser-by had turned their heads to look at us. The question seemed in\\nsome way to give her a shock.\\n\\n“Ah, I don’t know,” she muttered; “some might not think so, I always\\ndid; it depended upon the way you looked at her.”\\n\\nFor the first time I felt a thrill of anticipation shoot through my\\nveins. Why, I could not say. Her tone was peculiar, and she spoke in a\\nsort of brooding way as though she were weighing something in her own\\nmind; but then her manner had been peculiar throughout. Whatever it was\\nthat aroused my suspicion, I determined henceforth to keep a very sharp\\neye upon her ladyship. Levelling a straight glance at her face, I asked\\nher how it was that she came to be the one to inform the authorities of\\nthe girl’s disappearance.\\n\\n“Doesn’t Mr. Blake know anything about it?”\\n\\nThe faintest shadow of a change came into her manner. “Yes,” said she,\\n“I told him at breakfast time; but Mr. Blake doesn’t take much interest\\nin his servants; he leaves all such matters to me.”\\n\\n“Then he does not know you have come for the police?”\\n\\n“No, sir, and O, if you would be so good as to keep it from him. It is\\nnot necessary he should know. I shall let you in the back way. Mr. Blake\\nis a man who never meddles with anything, and--”\\n\\n“What did Mr. Blake say this morning when you told him that this\\ngirl--By the way, what is her name?”\\n\\n“Emily.”\\n\\n“That this girl, Emily, had disappeared during the night?”\\n\\n“Not much of anything, sir. He was sitting at the breakfast table\\nreading his paper, he merely looked up, frowned a little in an\\nabsent-minded way, and told me I must manage the servants’ affairs\\nwithout troubling him.”\\n\\n“And you let it drop?”\\n\\n“Yes sir; Mr. Blake is not a man to speak twice to.”\\n\\nI could easily believe that from what I had seen of him in public, for\\nthough by no means a harsh looking man, he had a reserved air which if\\nmaintained in private must have made him very difficult of approach.\\n\\nWe were now within a half block or so of the old-fashioned mansion\\nregarded by this scion of New York’s aristocracy as one of the most\\ndesirable residences in the city; so motioning to the man who had\\naccompanied me to take his stand in a doorway near by and watch for\\nthe signal I would give him in case I wanted Mr. Gryce, I turned to the\\nwoman, who was now all in a flutter, and asked her how she proposed to\\nget me into the house without the knowledge of Mr. Blake.\\n\\n“O sir, all you have got to do is to follow me right up the back stairs;\\nhe won’t notice, or if he does will not ask any questions.”\\n\\nAnd having by this time reached the basement door, she took out a key\\nfrom her pocket and inserting it in the lock, at once admitted us into\\nthe dwelling.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. A FEW POINTS\\n\\n\\nMrs. Daniels, for that was her name, took me at once up stairs to the\\nthird story back room. As we passed through the halls, I could not but\\nnotice how rich, though sombre were the old fashioned walls and heavily\\nfrescoed ceilings, so different in style and coloring from what we see\\nnow-a-days in our secret penetrations into Fifth Avenue mansions. Many\\nas are the wealthy houses I have been called upon to enter in the line\\nof my profession, I had never crossed the threshold of such an one as\\nthis before, and impervious as I am to any foolish sentimentalities,\\nI felt a certain degree of awe at the thought of invading with police\\ninvestigation, this home of ancient Knicker-bocker respectability. But\\nonce in the room of the missing girl, every consideration fled save that\\nof professional pride and curiosity. For almost at first blush, I saw\\nthat whether Mrs. Daniels was correct or not in her surmises as to the\\nmanner of the girl’s disappearance, the fact that she had disappeared\\nwas likely to prove an affair of some importance. For, let me state\\nthe facts in the order in which I noticed them. The first thing that\\nimpressed me was, that whatever Mrs. Daniels called her, this was no\\nsewing girl’s room into which I now stepped. Plain as was the furniture\\nin comparison with the elaborate richness of the walls and ceiling,\\nthere were still scattered through the room, which was large even for\\na thirty foot house, articles of sufficient elegance to make the\\nsupposition that it was the abode of an ordinary seamstress open to\\nsuspicion, if no more.\\n\\nMrs. Daniels, seeing my look of surprise, hastened to provide some\\nexplanation. “It is the room which has always been devoted to sewing,”\\n said she; “and when Emily came, I thought it would be easier to put up\\na bed here than to send her upstairs. She was a very nice girl and\\ndisarranged nothing.”\\n\\nI glanced around on the writing-case lying open on a small table in the\\ncentre of the room, on the vase half full of partly withered roses, on\\nthe mantel-piece, the Shakespeare, and Macaulay’s History lying on the\\nstand at my right, thought my own thoughts, but said nothing.\\n\\n“You found the door locked this morning?” asked I, after a moment’s\\nscrutiny of the room in which three facts had become manifest: first,\\nthat the girl had not occupied the bed the night before; second, that\\nthere had been some sort of struggle or surprise,--one of the curtains\\nbeing violently torn as if grasped by an agitated hand, to say nothing\\nof a chair lying upset on the floor with one of its legs broken; third,\\nthat the departure, strange as it may seem, had been by the window.\\n\\n“Yes,” returned she; “but there is a passageway leading from my room\\nto hers and it was by that means we entered. There was a chair placed\\nagainst the door on this side but we easily pushed it away.”\\n\\nI stepped to the window and looked out. Ah, it would not be so very\\ndifficult for a man to gain the street from that spot in a dark night,\\nfor the roof of the newly-erected extension was almost on a level with\\nthe window.\\n\\n“Well,” said she anxiously, “couldn’t she have been got out that way?”\\n\\n“More difficult things have been done,” said I; and was about to step\\nout upon the roof when I bethought to inquire of Mrs. Daniels if any of\\nthe girl’s clothing was missing.\\n\\nShe immediately flew to the closets and thence to bureau drawers which\\nshe turned hastily over. “No, nothing is missing but a hat and cloak\\nand--” She paused confusedly.\\n\\n“And what?” I asked.\\n\\n“Nothing,” returned she, hurriedly closing the bureau drawer; “only some\\nlittle knick-knacks.”\\n\\n“Knick-knacks!” quoth I. “If she stopped for knick-knacks, she couldn’t\\nhave gone in any very unwilling frame of mind.” And somewhat disgusted,\\nI was about to throw up the whole affair and leave the room. But the\\nindecision in Mrs. Daniels’ own face deterred me.\\n\\n“I don’t understand it,” murmured she, drawing her hand across her eyes.\\n“I don’t understand it. But,” she went on with even an increase in her\\nold tone of heart-felt conviction, “no matter whether we understand it\\nor not, the case is serious; I tell you so, and she must be found.”\\n\\nI resolved to know the nature of that must, used as few women in her\\nposition would use it even under circumstances to all appearance more\\naggravated than these.\\n\\n“Why, must?” said I. “If the girl went of her own accord as some things\\nseem to show, why should you, no relative as you acknowledge, take the\\nmatter so to heart as to insist she shall be followed and brought back?”\\n\\nShe turned away, uneasily taking up and putting down some little matters\\non the table before her. “Is it not enough that I promise to pay for\\nall expenses which a search will occasion, without my being forced to\\ndeclare just why I should be willing to do so? Am I bound to tell you I\\nlove the girl? that I believe she has been taken away by foul means,\\nand that to her great suffering and distress? that being fond of her and\\nbelieving this, I am conscientious enough to put every means I possess\\nat the command of those who will recover her?”\\n\\nI was not satisfied with this but on that very account felt my\\nenthusiasm revive.\\n\\n“But Mr. Blake? Surely he is the one to take this interest if anybody.”\\n\\n“I have before said,” returned she, paling however as she spoke, “that\\nMr. Blake takes very little interest in his servants.”\\n\\nI cast another glance about the room. “How long have you been in this\\nhouse?” asked I.\\n\\n“I was in the service of Mr. Blake’s father and he died a year ago.”\\n\\n“Since when you have remained with Mr. Blake himself?”\\n\\n“Yes sir.”\\n\\n“And this Emily, when did she come here?”\\n\\n“Oh it must be eleven months or so ago.”\\n\\n“An Irish girl?”\\n\\n“O no, American. She is not a common person, sir.”\\n\\n“What do you mean by that? That she was educated, lady-like, pretty, or\\nwhat?”\\n\\n“I don’t know what to say. She was educated, yes, but not as you would\\ncall a lady educated. Yet she knew a great many things the rest of us\\ndid’nt. She liked to read, you see, and--O sir, ask the girls about her,\\nI never know what to say when I am questioned.”\\n\\nI scanned the gray-haired woman still more intently than I had yet done.\\nWas she the weak common-place creature she seemed, or had she really\\nsome cause other than appeared for these her numerous breaks and\\nhesitations.\\n\\n“Where did you get this girl?” I inquired. “Where did she live before\\ncoming here?”\\n\\n“I cannot say, I never asked her to talk about herself. She came to me\\nfor work and I liked her and took her without recommendation.”\\n\\n“And she has served you well?”\\n\\n“Excellently.”\\n\\n“Been out much? Had any visitors?”\\n\\nShe shook her head. “Never went out and never had any visitors.”\\n\\nI own I was nonplussed, “Well,” said I, “no more of this at present.\\nI must first find out if she left this house alone or in company with\\nothers.” And without further parley I stepped out upon the roof of the\\nextension.\\n\\nAs I did so I debated with myself whether the case warranted me or not\\nin sending for Mr. Gryce. As yet there was nothing to show that the girl\\nhad come to any harm. A mere elopement with or without a lover to help\\nher, was not such a serious matter that the whole police force need\\nbe stirred up on the subject; and if the woman had money, as she said,\\nready to give the man who should discover the whereabouts of this girl,\\nwhy need that money be divided up any more than was necessary. Yet Gryce\\nwas not one to be dallied with. He had said, send for him if the affair\\nseemed to call for his judgment, and somehow the affair did promise to\\nbe a trifle complicated. I was yet undetermined when I reached the edge\\nof the roof.\\n\\nIt was a dizzy descent, but once made, escape from the yard beneath\\nwould be easy. A man could take that road without difficulty; but a\\nwoman! Baffled at the idea I turned thoughtfully back, when I beheld\\nsomething on the roof before me that caused me to pause and ask myself\\nif this was going to turn out to be a tragedy after all. It was a drop\\nof congealed blood. Further on towards the window was another, and\\nyes, further still, another and another. I even found one upon the very\\nwindow ledge itself. Bounding into the room, I searched the carpet for\\nfurther traces. It was the worst one in the world to find anything\\nupon of the nature of which I was seeking, being a confused pattern of\\nmingled drab and red, and in my difficulty I had to stoop very low.\\n\\n“What are you looking for?” cried Mrs. Daniels.\\n\\nI pointed to the drop on the window sill. “Do you see that?” I asked.\\n\\nShe uttered an exclamation and bent nearer. “Blood!” cried she, and\\nstood staring, with rapidly paling cheeks and trembling form. “They have\\nkilled her and he will never--”\\n\\nAs she did not finish I looked up.\\n\\n“Do you think it was her blood?” she whispered in a horrified tone.\\n\\n“There is every reason to believe so,” rejoined I, pointing to a spot\\nwhere I had at last discovered not only one crimson drop but many,\\nscattered over the scarcely redder roses under my feet.\\n\\n“Ah, it is worse than I thought,” murmured she. “What are you going to\\ndo? What can we do?\\n\\n“I am going to send for another detective,” returned I; and stepping to\\nthe window I telegraphed at once to the man Harris to go for Mr. Gryce.\\n\\n“The one we saw at the Station?”\\n\\nI bowed assent.\\n\\nHer face lost something of its drawn expression. “O I am glad; he will\\ndo something.”\\n\\nSubduing my indignation at this back thrust, I employed my time in\\ntaking note of such details as had escaped my previous attention. They\\nwere not many. The open writing-desk--in which, however I found no\\nletters or written documents of any kind, only a few sheets of paper,\\nwith pen, ink, etc.; the brush and hairpins scattered on the bureau as\\nthough the girl had been interrupted while arranging her hair (if she\\nhad been interrupted); and the absence of any great pile of work such as\\none would expect to see in a room set apart for sewing, were all I could\\ndiscover. Not much to help us, in case this was to prove an affair of\\nimportance as I began to suspect.\\n\\nWith Mr. Gryce’s arrival, however, things soon assumed a better shape.\\nHe came to the basement door, was ushered in by your humble servant, had\\nthe whole matter as far as I had investigated it, at his finger-ends in\\na moment, and was up-stairs and in that room before I, who am called the\\nquickest man in the force as you all know, could have time to determine\\njust what difference his presence would make to me in a pecuniary way in\\nevent of Mrs. Daniels’ promises amounting to anything. He did not remain\\nthere long, but when he came down I saw that his interest was in no wise\\nlessened.\\n\\n“What kind of a looking girl was this?” he asked, hurrying up to Mrs.\\nDaniels who had withdrawn into a recess in the lower hall while all this\\nwas going on. “Describe her to me, hair, eyes, complexion, etc.; you\\nknow.”\\n\\n“I--I--don’t know as I can,” she stammered reluctantly, turning very\\nred in the face. “I am a poor one for noticing. I will call one of the\\ngirls, I--” She was gone before we realized she had not finished her\\nsentence.\\n\\n“Humph!” broke from Mr. Gryce’s lips as he thoughtfully took down a vase\\nthat stood on a bracket near by and looked into it.\\n\\nI did not venture a word.\\n\\nWhen Mrs. Daniels came back she had with her a trim-looking girl of\\nprepossessing appearance.\\n\\n“This is Fanny,” said she; “she knows Emily well, being in the habit of\\nwaiting on her at table; she will tell you what you want to hear. I\\nhave explained to her,” she went on, nodding towards Mr. Gryce with a\\ncomposure such as she had not before displayed; “that you are looking\\nfor your niece who ran away from home some time ago to go into some sort\\nof service.”\\n\\n“Certainly, ma’am,” quoth that gentleman, bowing with mock admiration\\nto the gas-fixture. Then carelessly shifting his glance to the\\ncleaning-cloth which Fanny held rather conspicuously in her hand, he\\nrepeated the question he had already put to Mrs. Daniels.\\n\\nThe girl, tossing her head just a trifle, at once replied:\\n\\n“O she was good-looking enough, if that is what you mean, for them as\\nlikes a girl with cheeks as white as this cloth was afore I rubbed the\\nspoons with it. As for her eyes, they was blacker than her hair, which\\nwas the blackest I ever see. She had no flesh at all, and as for her\\nfigure--” Fanny glanced down on her own well developed person, and gave\\na shrug inexpressibly suggestive.\\n\\n“Is this description true?” Mr. Gryce asked, seemingly of Mrs. Daniels,\\nthough his gaze rested with curious intentness on the girl’s head which\\nwas covered with a little cap.\\n\\n“Sufficiently so,” returned Mrs. Daniels in a very low tone, however.\\nThen with a sudden display of energy, “Emily’s figure is not what\\nyou would call plump. I have seen her--” She broke off as if a little\\nstartled at herself and motioned Fanny to go.\\n\\n“Wait a moment,” interposed Mr. Gryce in his soft way. “You said the\\ngirl’s hair and eyes were dark; were they darker than yours?”\\n\\n“O, yes sir;” replied the girl simpering, as she settled the ribbons on\\nher cap.\\n\\n“Let me see your hair.”\\n\\nShe took off her cap with a smile.\\n\\n“Ha, very pretty, very pretty. And the other girls? You have other girls\\nI suppose?”\\n\\n“Two, sir;” returned Mrs. Daniels.\\n\\n“How about their complexions? Are they lighter too than Emily’s?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir; about like Fanny’s.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce spread his hand over his breast in a way that assured me of\\nhis satisfaction, and allowed the girl to go.\\n\\n“We will now proceed to the yard,” said he. But at that moment the door\\nof the front room opened and a gentleman stepped leisurely into the\\nhall, whom at first glance I recognized as the master of the house. He\\nwas dressed for the street and had his hat in his hand. At the sight\\nwe all stood silent, Mrs. Daniels flushing up to the roots of her gray\\nhair.\\n\\nMr. Blake is an elegant-looking man as you perhaps know; proud,\\nreserved, and a trifle sombre. As he turned to come towards us, the\\nlight shining through the windows at our right, fell full upon his\\nface, revealing such a self-absorbed and melancholy expression, I\\ninvoluntarily drew back as if I had unwittingly intruded upon a great\\nman’s privacy. Mr. Gryce on the contrary stepped forward.\\n\\n“Mr. Blake, I believe,” said he, bowing in that deferential way he knows\\nso well how to assume.\\n\\nThe gentleman, startled as it evidently seemed from a reverie, looked\\nhastily up. Meeting Mr. Gryce’s bland smile, he returned the bow, but\\nhaughtily, and as it appeared in an abstracted way.\\n\\n“Allow me to introduce myself,” proceeded my superior. “I am Mr. Gryce\\nfrom the detective bureau. We were notified this morning that a girl\\nin your employ had disappeared from your house last night in a somewhat\\nstrange and unusual way, and I just stepped over with my man here, to\\nsee if the matter is of sufficient importance to inquire into. With many\\napologies for the intrusion, I stand obedient to your orders.”\\n\\nWith a frown expressive of annoyance, Mr. Blake glanced around and\\ndetecting Mrs. Daniels, said: “Did you consider the affair so serious as\\nthat?”\\n\\nShe nodded, seeming to find it difficult to speak.\\n\\nHe remained looking at her with an expression of some doubt. “I can\\nhardly think,” said he, “such extreme measures were necessary; the girl\\nwill doubtless come back, or if not--” His shoulders gave a slight shrug\\nand he took out his gloves.\\n\\n“The difficulty seems to be,” quoth Mr. Gryce eyeing those gloves with\\nhis most intent and concentrated look, “that the girl did not go alone,\\nbut was helped away, or forced away, by parties who had previously\\nbroken into your house.”\\n\\n“That is a strange circumstance,” remarked Mr. Blake, but still without\\nany appearance of interest, “and if you are sure of what you say,\\ndemands, perhaps, some inquiry. I would not wish to put anything in the\\nway of justice succoring the injured. But--” again he gave that slight\\nshrug of the shoulders, indicative of doubt, if not indifference.\\n\\nMrs. Daniels trembled, and took a step forward. I thought she was\\ngoing to speak, but instead of that she drew back again in her strange\\nhesitating way.\\n\\nMr. Gryce did not seem to notice.\\n\\n“Perhaps sir,” said he, “if you will step upstairs with me to the room\\noccupied by this girl, I may be able to show you certain evidences which\\nwill convince you that our errand here is not one of presumption.”\\n\\n“I am ready to concede that without troubling myself with proof,”\\n observed the master of the house with the faintest show of asperity.\\n“Yet if there is anything to see of a startling nature, perhaps I had\\nbest yield to your wishes. Whereabouts in the house is this girl’s room,\\nMrs. Daniels?”\\n\\n“It is--I gave her the third story back, Mr. Blake;” replied that woman,\\nnervously eyeing his face. “It was large and light for sewing, and she\\nwas so nice--”\\n\\nHe impatiently waved his hand on which he had by this time fitted his\\nglove to a nicety, as if these details were an unnecessary bore to him,\\nand motioned her to show the way. Instantly a new feeling appeared to\\nseize her, that of alarm.\\n\\n“I hardly think you need trouble Mr. Blake to go up-stairs,” she\\nmurmured, turning towards Mr. Gryce. “I am sure when you tell him the\\ncurtains were torn, and the chair upset, the window open and--”\\n\\nBut Mr. Gryce was already on the stairs with Mr. Blake, whom this small\\nopposition seemed to have at once determined.\\n\\n“O my God!” she murmured to herself, “who could have foreseen this.”\\n And ignoring my presence with all the egotism of extreme agitation, she\\nhurried past me to the room above, where I speedily joined her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. THE CONTENTS OF A BUREAU DRAWER\\n\\nMr. Blake was standing in the centre of the room when I entered,\\ncarelessly following with his eyes the motion of Mr. Gryce’s finger as\\nthat gentleman pointed with unwearying assiduity to the various little\\ndetails that had struck us. His hat was still in his hand, and he\\npresented a very formidable and imposing appearance, or so Mrs. Daniels\\nappeared to think as she stood watching him from the corner, whither she\\nhad withdrawn herself.\\n\\n“A forcible departure you see,” exclaimed Mr. Gryce; “she had not even\\ntime to gather up her clothes;” and with a sudden movement he stooped\\nand pulled out one of the bureau drawers before the eyes of his\\nnonchalant listener.\\n\\nImmediately a smothered exclamation struck our ears, and Mrs. Daniels\\nstarted forward.\\n\\n“I pray, gentlemen,” she entreated, advancing in such a way as to place\\nherself against the front of the bureau in a manner to preclude the\\nopening of any more drawers, “that you will remember that a modest woman\\nsuch as this girl was, would hardly like to have her clothing displayed\\nbefore the eyes of strangers.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce instantly closed the drawer.\\n\\n“You are right,” said he; “pardon the rough ways of a somewhat hardened\\nofficer of the law.”\\n\\nShe drew up closer to the bureau, still protecting it with her meagre\\nbut energetic form while her eyes rested with almost a savage expression\\nupon the master of the house as if he, and not the detective, had been\\nthe aggressor whose advances she feared.\\n\\nMr. Blake did not return the look.\\n\\n“If that is all you can show me, I think I will proceed to my\\nappointment,” said he. “The matter does seem to be more serious than I\\nthought, and if you judge it necessary to take any active measures, why,\\nlet no consideration of my great and inherent dislike to notoriety of\\nany kind, interfere with what you consider your duty. As for the house,\\nit is at your command, under Mrs. Daniels’ direction. Good morning.” And\\nreturning our bows with one singularly impressive for all its elegant\\ncarelessness, he at once withdrew.\\n\\nMrs. Daniels took one long deep breath and came from the bureau.\\nInstantly Mr. Gryce stooped and pulled out the drawer she had so visibly\\nprotected. A white towel met our eyes, spread neatly out at its full\\nlength. Lifting it, we looked beneath. A carefully folded dress of dark\\nblue silk, to all appearance elegantly made, confronted our rather\\neager eyes. Beside it, a collar of exquisite lace--I know enough of such\\nmatters to be a judge--pricked through by a gold breast-pin of a strange\\nand unique pattern. A withered bunch of what appeared to have been a\\nbouquet of red roses, surmounted the whole, giving to the otherwise\\ncommonplace collection the appearance of a relic from the tomb.\\n\\nWe both drew back in some amazement, involuntarily glancing up at Mrs.\\nDaniels.\\n\\n“I have no explanation to give,” said that woman, with a calmness\\nstrangely in contrast to the agitation she had displayed while Mr. Blake\\nhad remained in the room. “That those things rich as they are, really\\nbelonged to the girl, I have no doubt. She brought them when she came,\\nand they only confirm what I have before intimated: that she was no\\nordinary sewing girl, but a woman who had seen better days.”\\n\\nWith a low “humph!” and another glance at the dark blue dress and\\ndelicate collar, Mr. Gryce carefully replaced the cloth he had taken\\nfrom them, and softly closed the drawer without either of us having laid\\na finger upon a single article. Five minutes later he disappeared from\\nthe room.\\n\\nI did not see him again till occasion took me below, when I beheld him\\nsoftly issue from Mr. Blake’s private apartment. Meeting me, he smiled,\\nand I saw that whether he was conscious of betraying it or not, he had\\ncome upon some clue or at the least fashioned for himself some theory\\nwith which he was more or less satisfied.\\n\\n“An elegant apartment, that,” whispered he, nodding sideways toward the\\nroom he had just left, “pity you haven’t time to examine it.”\\n\\n“Are you sure that I haven’t?” returned I, drawing a step nearer to\\nescape the eyes of Mrs. Daniels who had descended after me.\\n\\n“Quite sure;” and we hastened down together into the yard.\\n\\nBut my curiosity once aroused in this way would not let me rest. Taking\\nan opportunity when Mr. Gryce was engaged in banter with the girls\\nbelow, and in this way learning more in a minute of what he wanted to\\nknow than some men would gather in an hour by that or any other method,\\nI stole lightly back and entered this room.\\n\\nI almost started in my surprise. Instead of the luxurious apartment I\\nhad prepared myself to behold, a plain, scantily-furnished room opened\\nbefore me, of a nature between a library and a studio. There was not\\neven a carpet on the polished floor, only a rug, which strange to say\\nwas not placed in the centre of the room or even before the fireplace,\\nbut on one side, and directly in front of a picture that almost at first\\nblush had attracted my attention as being the only article in the room\\nworth looking at. It was the portrait of a woman, handsome, haughty and\\nalluring; a modern beauty, with eyes of fire burning beneath high piled\\nlocks of jetty blackness, that were only relieved from being too intense\\nby the scarlet hood of an opera cloak, that was drawn over them. “A\\nsister,” I thought to myself, “it is too modern for his mother,” and I\\ntook a step nearer to see if I could trace any likeness in the chiselled\\nfeatures of this disdainful brunette, to the more characteristic ones\\nof the careless gentleman who had stood but a few moments before in my\\npresence. As I did so, I was struck with the distance with which\\nthe picture stood out from the wall, and thought to myself that\\nthe awkwardness of the framing came near marring the beauty of this\\notherwise lovely work of art. As for the likeness I was in search of, I\\nfound it or thought I did, in the expression of the eyes which were\\nof the same color as Mr. Blake’s but more full and passionate; and\\nsatisfied that I had exhausted all the picture could tell me, I\\nturned to make what other observations I could, when I was startled by\\nconfronting the agitated countenance of Mrs. Daniels who had entered\\nbehind me.\\n\\n“This is Mr. Blake’s room,” said she with dignity; “no one ever intrudes\\nhere but myself, not even the servants.”\\n\\n“I beg pardon,” said I, glancing around in vain for the something which\\nhad awakened that look of satisfaction in Mr. Gryce’s eyes. “I was\\nattracted by the beauty of this picture visible through the half open\\ndoor and stepped in to favor myself with a nearer view. It is very\\nlovely. A sister of Mr. Blake?”\\n\\n“No, his cousin;” and she closed the door after us with an emphasis that\\nproclaimed she was anything but pleased.\\n\\nIt was my last effort to obtain information on my own account. In a few\\nmoments later Mr. Gryce appeared from below, and a conversation ensued\\nwith Mrs. Daniels that absorbed my whole attention.\\n\\n“You are very anxious, my man here tells me, that this girl should be\\nfound?” remarked Mr. Gryce; “so much so that you are willing to defray\\nall the expenses of a search?”\\n\\nShe bowed. “As far as I am able sir; I have a few hundreds in the\\nbank, you are welcome to them. I would not keep a dollar back if I\\nhad thousands, but I am poor, and can only promise you what I myself\\npossess; though--” and her cheeks grew flushed and hot with an unnatural\\nagitation--“I believe that thousands would not be lacking if they were\\nfound necessary. I--I could almost swear you shall have anything in\\nreason which you require; only the girl must be found and soon.”\\n\\n“Have you thought,” proceeded Mr. Gryce, utterly ignoring the wildness\\nof these statements, “that the girl may come back herself if let alone?”\\n\\n“She will come back if she can,” quoth Mrs. Daniels.\\n\\n“Did she seem so well satisfied with her home as to warrant you in\\nsaying that?”\\n\\n“She liked her home, but she loved me,” returned the woman steadily.\\n“She loved me so well she would never have gone as she did without being\\nforced. Yes,” said she, “though she made no outcry and stopped to put\\non her bonnet and shawl. She was not a girl to make a fuss. If they had\\nkilled her outright, she would never have uttered a cry.”\\n\\n“Why do you say they?”\\n\\n“Because I am confident I heard more than one man’s voice in her room.”\\n\\n“Humph! Would you know those voices if you heard them again?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\nThere was a surprise in this last negative which Mr. Gryce evidently\\nnoticed.\\n\\n“I ask,” said he, “because I have been told that Mr. Blake lately kept a\\nbody servant who has been seen to look at this girl more than once, when\\nshe has passed him on the stairs.”\\n\\nMrs. Daniels’ face turned scarlet with rage and she hastily rose from\\nthe chair. “I don’t believe it,” said she; “Henry was a man who knew his\\nplace, and--I won’t hear such things,” she suddenly exclaimed; “Emily\\nwas--was a lady, and--”\\n\\n“Well, well,” interposed Mr. Gryce soothingly, “though the cat looks at\\nthe king, it is no sign the king looks at the cat. We have to think of\\neverything you know.”\\n\\n“You must never think of anything like that.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce softly ran his thumb around the brim of the hat he held in his\\nhand. “Mrs. Daniels,” observed he, “it would greatly facilitate matters\\nif you would kindly tell us why you take such an interest in this girl.\\nOne glimpse at her real history would do more towards setting us on the\\nright track than anything else you could offer.”\\n\\nHer face assumed an unmistakable frown. “Have I not told you,” said she,\\n“what is known of it? That she came to me about two years ago for work;\\nthat I liked her, and so hired her; that she has been with us ever since\\nand--”\\n\\n“Then you will not tell us?” exclaimed Mr. Gryce.\\n\\nHer face fell and a look of hesitation crossed it.\\n\\n“I doubt if we can do anything unless you do,” continued he.\\n\\nHer countenance settled again into a resolved expression.\\n\\n“You are mistaken,” said she; “if the girl had a secret--as nearly all\\ngirls have, brought low as she has evidently been--it had nothing to do\\nwith her disappearance, nor would a knowledge of it help you in any way.\\nI am confident of this and so shall hold my peace.”\\n\\nShe was not a woman to be frightened or cajoled into making revelations\\nshe did not think necessary, and seeing it, Mr. Gryce refrained from\\nurging her further.\\n\\n“However, you will at least tell me this,” said he, “what were the\\nknick-knacks she took away with her from her bureau drawer?”\\n\\n“No,” said she, “for they have nothing to do with her abduction. They\\nwere articles of positive value to her, though I assure you of little\\nimportance to any one else. All that is shown by their disappearance is\\nthe fact that she had a moment’s time allowed her in which to collect\\nwhat she most wanted.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce arose. “Well,” said he, “you have given us a hard sum to\\nwork out, but I am not the man to recoil from anything hard. If I can\\ndiscover the whereabouts of this girl I will certainly do it, but you\\nmust help me.”\\n\\n“I, how?”\\n\\n“By inserting a personal in the Herald. You say she loves you; and would\\ncome back if she could. Now whether you believe it or not this is open\\nto doubt; therefore I would advise that you take some such means as\\nthat to inform her of the anxiety of her friends and their desire to\\ncommunicate with her.”\\n\\n“Impossible,” she cried vehemently. “I should be afraid--”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“I might put it that Mrs. D----, anxious about Emily, desires\\ninformation of her whereabouts--”\\n\\n“Put it any way you like.”\\n\\n“You had better add,” said I, speaking for the first time, “that you\\nwould be willing to pay for information.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Mr. Gryce, “add that.”\\n\\nMrs. Daniels frowned, but made no objection, and after getting as minute\\na description as possible of the clothing worn by the girl the night\\nbefore, we left the house.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. THOMPSON’S STORY\\n\\n\\n“An affair of some mystery,” remarked Mr. Gryce, as we halted at the\\ncorner to take a final look at the house and its environs. “Why a girl\\nshould choose such a method of descent as that,”--and he pointed to the\\nladder down which we believed her to have come--“to leave a house of\\nwhich she had been an inmate for a year, baffles me, I can tell you. If\\nit were not for those marks of blood which betray her track, I would\\nbe disinclined to believe any such hare-brained adventure was ever\\nperpetrated by a woman. As it is, what would’nt I give for her\\nphotograph. Black hair, black eyes, white face and thin figure! what a\\ndescription whereby to find a girl in this great city of New York.\\nAh!” said he with sudden gratification, “here is Mr. Blake again; his\\nappointment must have been a failure. Let us see if his description will\\nbe any more definite.” And hurrying towards the advancing figure of that\\ngentleman, he put some questions to him.\\n\\nInstantly Mr. Blake stopped, looked at him blankly for a moment, then\\nreplied in a tone sufficiently loud for me to hear:\\n\\n“I am sorry, sir, if my description could have done you any good, but I\\nhave not the remotest idea how the girl looked. I did not know till\\nthis morning even, that there was such a person in my house as a\\nsewing-woman. I leave all such domestic concerns entirely with Mrs.\\nDaniels.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce again bowed low and ventured another question. The answer came\\nas before, distinctly to my ears.\\n\\n“O, I may have seen her, I can not say about that; I very often run\\nacross the servants in the hall; but whether she is tall or short, light\\nor dark, pretty or ugly, I know no more than you do, sir.” Then with\\na dignified nod calculated to abash a man in Mr. Gryce’s position,\\ninquired,\\n\\n“Is that all?”\\n\\nIt did not seem to be, Mr. Gryce put another question.\\n\\nMr. Blake give him a surprised stare before replying, then courteously\\nremarked,\\n\\n“I do not concern myself with servants after they have left me. Henry\\nwas an excellent valet, but a trifle domineering, something which I\\nnever allow in any one who approaches me. I dismissed him and that was\\nthe end of it, I know nothing of what has become of him.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce bowed and drew back, and Mr. Blake, with the haughty step\\npeculiar to him, passed by him and reentered his house.\\n\\n“I should not like to get into that man’s clutches,” said I, as my\\nsuperior rejoined me; “he has a way of making one appear so small.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce shot an askance look at his shadow gloomily following him\\nalong the pavement. “Yet it may happen that you will have to run the\\nrisk of that very experience.”\\n\\nI glanced towards him in amazement.\\n\\n“If the girl does not turn up of her own accord, or if we do not succeed\\nin getting some trace of her movements, I shall be tempted to place you\\nwhere you can study into the ways of this gentleman’s household. If the\\naffair is a mystery, it has its centre in that house.”\\n\\nI stared at Mr. Gryce good and roundly. “You have come across\\nsomething which I have missed,” observed I, “or you could not speak so\\npositively.”\\n\\n“I have come across nothing that was not in plain sight of any body who\\nhad eyes to see it,” he returned shortly.\\n\\nI shook my head slightly mortified.\\n\\n“You had it all before you,” continued he, “and if you were not able\\nto pick up sufficient facts on which to base a conclusion, you mustn’t\\nblame me for it.”\\n\\nMore nettled than I would be willing to confess, I walked back with\\nhim to the station, saying nothing then, but inwardly determined to\\nreestablish my reputation with Mr. Gryce before the affair was over.\\nAccordingly hunting up the man who had patrolled the district the night\\nbefore, I inquired if he had seen any one go in or out of the side gate\\nof Mr. Blake’s house on ----- street, between the hours of eleven and\\none.\\n\\n“No,” said he, “but I heard Thompson tell a curious story this morning\\nabout some one he had seen.”\\n\\n“What was it?”\\n\\n“He said he was passing that way last night about twelve o’clock when he\\nremarked standing under the lamp on the corner of Second Avenue, a group\\nconsisting of two men and a woman, who no sooner beheld him than they\\nseparated, the men drawing back into Second Avenue and the woman coming\\nhastily towards him. Not understanding the move, he stood waiting her\\napproach, when instead of advancing to where he was, she paused at the\\ngate of Mr. Blake’s house and lifted her hand as if to open it, when\\nwith a wild and terrified gesture she started back, covering her\\nface with her hands, and before he knew it, had actually fled in the\\ndirection from which she had come. A little startled, Thompson advanced\\nand looked through the gate before him to see if possible what had\\nalarmed her, when to his great surprise, he beheld the pale face of the\\nmaster of the house, Mr. Blake himself, looking through the bars from\\nthe other side of the gate. He in his turn started back and before he\\ncould recover himself, Mr. Blake had disappeared. He says he tried the\\ngate after that, but found it locked.”\\n\\n“Thompson tells you this story, does he?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Well,” said I, “it’s a pretty wild kind of a tale, and all I have\\ngot to say is, that neither you nor Thompson had better go blabbing\\nit around too much. Mum is the word where such men as Mr. Blake are\\nconcerned.” And I departed to hunt up Thompson.\\n\\nBut he had nothing to add to his statement, except that the girl\\nappeared to be tall and thin, and was closely wrapped about in a shawl.\\nMy next move was to make such inquiries as I could with safety into the\\nprivate concerns of Mr. Blake and his family, and discovered--well, such\\nfacts as these:\\n\\nThat Mr. Blake was a man who if he paid but little attention to domestic\\naffairs was yet rarely seen out of his own house, except upon occasions\\nof great political importance, when he was always to be found on\\nthe platform at meetings of his constituents. Though to the ordinary\\nobserver a man eminently calculated, from his good looks, fine position,\\nand solid wealth to enjoy society, he not only manifested a distaste\\nfor it, but even went so far as to refuse to participate in the social\\ndinners of his most intimate friends; the only table to which he would\\nsit down being that of some public caterer, where he was sure of finding\\nnone but his political associates assembled.\\n\\nTo all appearance he wished to avoid the ladies, a theory borne out by\\nthe fact that never, even in church, on the street, or at any place of\\namusement, was he observed with one at his side. This fact in a\\nman, young--he was not far from thirty-five at that time--rich, and\\nmarriageable, would, however, have been more noteworthy than it was\\nif he had not been known to belong to a family eminent for their\\neccentricities. Not a man of all his race but had possessed some marked\\npeculiarity. His father, bibliomaniac though he was, would never treat a\\nman or a woman with decency, who mentioned Shakspeare to him, nor would\\nhe acknowledge to his dying day any excellence in that divine poet\\nbeyond a happy way of putting words together. Mr. Blake’s uncle hated\\nall members of the legal profession, and as for his grandfather--but you\\nhave heard what a mania of dislike he had against that simple article of\\ndiet, fish; how his friends were obliged to omit it from their bills of\\nfare whenever they expected him to dinner. If then Mr. Blake chose\\nto have any pet antipathy--as for women for instance--he surely\\nhad precedent enough in his own family to back him. However, it was\\nwhispered in my ear by one gentleman, a former political colleague of\\nhis who had been with him in Washington, that he was known at one time\\nto show considerable attention to Miss Evelyn Blake, that cousin of\\nhis who has since made such a brilliant thing of it by marrying, and\\nstraightway losing by death, a wealthy old scapegrace of a French noble,\\nthe Count De Mirac. But that was not a matter to be talked about,\\nMadame the Countess being free at present and in New York, though to all\\nappearance upon anything but pleasant terms with her quondam admirer.\\n\\nRemembering the picture I had seen in Mr. Blake’s private apartment, I\\nasked if this lady was a brunette, and being told she was, and of the\\nmost pronounced type, felt for the moment I had stumbled upon something\\nin the shape of a clue; but upon resorting to Mr. Gryce with my\\ninformation, he shook his head with a short laugh and told me I would\\nhave to dive deeper than that if I wanted to fish up the truth lying at\\nthe bottom of this well.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. A NEW YORK BELLE\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile all our efforts to obtain information in regard to the fate or\\nwhereabouts of the missing girl, had so far proved utterly futile. Even\\nthe advertisements inserted by Mrs. Daniels had produced no effect; and\\nfrustrated in my scheme I began to despair, when the accounts of that\\nsame Mrs. Daniels’ strange and unaccountable behavior during these days\\nof suspense, which came to me through Fanny, (the pretty housemaid at\\nMr. Blake’s, whose acquaintance I had lately taken to cultivating,)\\naroused once more my dormant energies and led me to ask myself if the\\naffair was quite as hopeless as it seemed.\\n\\n“If she was a ghost,” was her final expression on the subject, “she\\ncould’nt go peramberlating this house more than she does. It seems as if\\nshe could’nt keep still a minute. Upstairs and down, upstairs and down,\\ntill we’re most wild. And so white as she is and so trembling! Why her\\nhands shake so all the time she never dares lift a dish off the table.\\nAnd then the way she hangs about Mr. Blake’s door when he’s at home!\\nShe never goes in, that’s the oddest part of it, but walks up and down\\nbefore it, wringing her hands and talking to herself just like a mad\\nwoman. Why, I have seen her almost put her hand on the knob twice in\\nan afternoon perhaps, then draw back as if she was afraid it would burn\\nher; and if by any chance the door opened and Mr. Blake came out, you\\nought to have seen how she run. What it all means I don’t know, but I\\nhave my imaginings, and if she is’nt crazy, why--” etc., etc.\\n\\nIn face of facts like these I felt it would be pure insanity to despair.\\nLet there be but a mystery, though it involved a man of the position of\\nMr. Blake and I was safe. My only apprehension had been that the whole\\naffair would dissolve itself into an ordinary elopement or some such\\ncommon-place matter.\\n\\nWhen, therefore, a few minutes later, Fanny announced that Mr. Blake\\nhad ordered a carriage to take him to the Charity Ball that evening,\\nI determined to follow him and learn if possible what change had\\ntaken place in himself or his circumstances, to lead him into such an\\ninnovation upon his usual habits. Though the hour was late I had but\\nlittle difficulty in carrying out my plan, arriving at the Academy\\nsomething less than an hour after the opening dance.\\n\\nThe crowd was great and I circulated the floor three times before I came\\nupon him. When I did, I own I was slightly disappointed; for instead of\\nfinding him as I anticipated, the centre of an admiring circle of ladies\\nand gentlemen, I espied him withdrawn into a corner with a bland old\\npolitician of the Fifteenth Ward, discussing, as I presently overheard,\\nthe merits and demerits of a certain Smith who at that time was making\\nsome disturbance in the party.\\n\\n“If that is all he has come for,” thought I, “I had better have stayed\\nat home and made love to the pretty Fanny.” And somewhat chagrined, I\\ntook up my stand near by, and began scrutinizing the ladies.\\n\\nSuddenly I felt my heart stand still, the noise of voices ceasing\\nthe same instant behind me. A lady was passing on the arm of a\\nforeign-looking gentleman, whom it did not require a second glance to\\nidentify with the subject of the portrait in Mr. Blake’s house. Older by\\nsome few years than when her picture was painted, her beauty had assumed\\na certain defiant expression that sufficiently betrayed the fact that\\nthe years had not been so wholly happy as she had probably anticipated\\nwhen she jilted handsome Holman Blake for the old French Count. At all\\nevents so I interpreted the look of latent scorn that burned in her dark\\neyes, as she slowly turned her richly bejeweled head towards the corner\\nwhere that gentleman stood, and meeting his eyes no doubt, bowed with a\\nsudden loss of self-possession that not all the haughty carriage of\\nher noble form, held doubly erect for the next few moments, could quite\\nconceal or make forgotten.\\n\\n“She still loves him,” I inwardly commented and turned to see if the\\nsurprise had awakened any expression on his uncommunicative countenance.\\n\\nEvidently not, for the tough old politician of the Fifteenth Ward was\\nlaughing, at one of his own jokes probably, and looking up in the\\nface of Mr. Blake, whose back was turned to me, in a way that entirely\\nprecluded all thought of any tragic expression in that quarter. Somewhat\\ndisgusted, I withdrew and followed the lady.\\n\\nI could not get very near. By this time the presence of a live countess\\nin the assembly had become known, and I found her surrounded by a swarm\\nof half-fledged youths. But I cared little for this; all I wanted to\\nknow was whether Mr. Blake would approach her or not during the evening.\\nTediously the moments passed; but a detective on duty, or on fancied\\nduty, succumbs to no weariness. I had a woman before me worth studying\\nand the time could not be thrown away. I learned to know her beauty;\\nthe poise of her head, the flush of her cheek, the curl of her lip, the\\nglance--yes, the glance of her eye, though that was more difficult to\\nunderstand, for she had a way of drooping her lids at times that, while\\nexceedingly effective upon the poor wretch toward whom she might be\\ndirecting that half-veiled shaft of light, was anything but conducive to\\nmy purposes.\\n\\nAt length with a restless shrug of her haughty shoulders she turned away\\nfrom her crowd of adorers, her breast heaving under its robing of garnet\\nvelvet, and her whole face flaring with a light that might mean resolve\\nand might mean simply love. I had no need to turn my head to see who was\\nadvancing towards her; her stately attitude as countess, her thrilling\\nglance as woman, betrayed only too readily.\\n\\nHe was the more composed of the two. Bowing over her hand with a few\\nwords I could not hear, he drew back a step and began uttering the usual\\ncommon-place sentiments of the occasion.\\n\\nShe did not respond. With a splendor of indifference not often seen even\\nin the manner of our grandest ladies, she waited, opening and shutting\\nher richly feathered fan, as one who would say, “I know all this has to\\nbe gone through with, therefore I will be patient.” But as the moments\\npassed, and his tone remained unchanged, I could detect a slight gleam\\nof impatience flash in the depths of her dark eyes, and a change\\ncome into the conventional smile that had hitherto lighted, without\\nilluminating her countenance. Drawing still further back from the crowd\\nthat was not to be awed from pressing upon her, she looked around as if\\nseeking a refuge. Her glance fell upon a certain window, with a gleam\\nof satisfaction. Seeing they would straightway withdraw there, I took\\nadvantage of the moment and made haste to conceal myself behind a\\ncurtain as near that vicinity as possible. In another instant I heard\\nthem approaching.\\n\\n“You seem to be rather overwhelmed with attention to-night,” were the\\nfirst words I caught, uttered in Mr. Blake’s calmest and most courteous\\ntones.\\n\\n“Do you think so?” was the slightly sarcastic reply. “I was just\\ndeciding to the contrary when you came up.”\\n\\nThere was a pause. Taking out my knife, I ripped open a seam in the\\ncurtain hanging before me, and looked through. He was eyeing her\\nintently, a firm look upon his face that made its reserve more marked\\nthan common. I saw him gaze at her handsome head piled with its midnight\\ntresses amid which the jewels, doubtless of her dead lord, burned with\\na fierce and ominous glare, at her smooth olive brow, her partly veiled\\neyes where the fire passionately blazed, at her scarlet lips trembling\\nwith an emotion her rapidly flushing cheeks would not allow her to\\nconceal. I saw his glances fall and embrace her whole elegant form with\\nits casing of ruby velvet and ornamentation of lace and diamonds, and\\nan expectant thrill passed through me almost as if I already beheld the\\nmask of his reserve falling, and the true man flash out in response to\\nthe wooing beauty of this full-blown rose, evidently in waiting for him.\\nBut it died away and a deeper feeling seized me as I saw his glances\\nreturn unkindled to her countenance, and heard him say in still more\\nmeasured accents than before:\\n\\n“Is it possible then that the Countess De Mirac can desire the adulation\\nof us poor American plebeians? I had not thought it, madame.”\\n\\nSlowly her dark eyes turned towards him; she stood a statue.\\n\\n“But I forget,” he went on, a tinge of bitterness for a moment showing\\nitself in his smile: “perhaps in returning to her own country, Evelyn\\nBlake has so far forgotten the last two years as to find pleasure again\\nin the toys and foibles of her youth. Such things have been, I hear.”\\n And he bowed almost to the ground in his half sarcastic homage.\\n\\n“Evelyn Blake! It is long since I have heard that name,” she murmured.\\n\\nHe could not restrain the quick flush from mounting to his brow. “Pardon\\nme,” said he, “if it brings you sadness or unwelcome memories. I promise\\nyou I will not so transgress again.”\\n\\nA wan smile crossed her lips grown suddenly pallid.\\n\\n“You mistake,” said she; “if my name brings up a past laden with bitter\\nmemories and shadowed by regret, it also recalls much that is pleasant\\nand never to be forgotten. I do not object to hearing my girlhood’s name\\nuttered--by my nearest relative.”\\n\\nThe answer was dignity itself. “Your name is Countess De Mirac, your\\nrelatives must be proud to utter it.”\\n\\nA gleam not unlike the lightning’s quick flash shot from the eyes she\\ndrooped before him.\\n\\n“Is it Holman Blake I am listening to,” said she; “I do not recognize my\\nold friend in the cool and sarcastic man of the world now before me.”\\n\\n“We often fail to recognize the work of our hands, madame, after it has\\nfallen from our grasp.”\\n\\n“What,” she cried, “do you mean--would you say that--”\\n\\n“I would say nothing,” interrupted he calmly, stooping for the fan she\\nhad dropped. “At an interview which is at once a meeting and a parting,\\nI would give utterance to nothing which would seem like recrimination.\\nI--”\\n\\n“Wait,” suddenly exclaimed she, reaching out her hand for her fan with a\\ngesture lofty as it was resolute. “You have spoken a word which demands\\nexplanation; what have I ever done to you that you should speak the word\\nrecrimination to me?”\\n\\n“What? You shook my faith in womankind; you showed me that a woman who\\nhad once told a man she loved him, could so far forget that love as to\\nmarry one she could never respect, for the sake of titles and jewels.\\nYou showed me--”\\n\\n“Hold,” said she again, this time without gesture or any movement, save\\nthat of her lips grown pallid as marble, “and what did you show me?”\\n\\nHe started, colored profoundly, and for a moment stood before her\\nunmasked of his stern self-possession. “I beg your pardon,” said he, “I\\ntake back that word, recrimination.”\\n\\nIt was now her turn to lift her head and survey him. With glance less\\ncool than his, but fully as deliberate, she looked at his proud head\\nbending before her; studying his face, line by line, from the stern brow\\nto the closely compressed lips on which melancholy seemed to have\\nset its everlasting seal, and a change passed over her countenance.\\n“Holman,” said she, with a sudden rush of tenderness, “if in the times\\ngone by, we both behaved with too much worldly prudence for it now to be\\nany great pleasure for either of us to look back, is that any reason\\nwhy we should mar our whole future by dwelling too long upon what we are\\nsurely still young enough to bury if not forget? I acknowledge that\\nI would have behaved in a more ideal fashion, if, after I had been\\nforsaken by you, I had turned my face from society, and let the\\ncanker-worm of despair slowly destroy whatever life and bloom I had\\nleft. But I was young, and society had its charms, so did the prospect\\nof wealth and position, however hollow they may have proved; you who\\nare the master of both this day, because twelve months ago you forsook\\nEvelyn Blake, should be the last to reproach me with them. I do not\\nreproach you; I only say let the past be forgotten--”\\n\\n“Impossible,” exclaimed he, his whole face darkening with an expression\\nI could not fathom. “What was done at that time cannot be undone. For\\nyou and me there is no future. Yes,” he said turning towards her as she\\nmade a slight fluttering move of dissent, “no future; we can bury the\\npast, but we can not resurrect it. I doubt if you would wish to if we\\ncould; as we cannot, of course you will not desire even to converse upon\\nthe subject again. Evelyn I wanted to see you once, but I do not wish to\\nsee you again; will you pardon my plain speaking, and release me?”\\n\\n“I will pardon your plain speaking, but--” Her look said she would not\\nrelease him.\\n\\nHe seemed to understand it so, and smiled, but very bitterly. In another\\nmoment he had bowed and gone, and she had returned to her crowd of\\nadoring sycophants.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. A BIT OF CALICO\\n\\n\\nIt was about this time that I took up my residence in a sort of\\nlodging-house that occupied the opposite corner to that of Mr. Blake.\\nMy room, as I took pains to have it, overlooked the avenue, and from\\nits windows I could easily watch the goings and comings of the gentleman\\nwhose movements were daily becoming of more and more interest to me.\\nFor set it down to caprice--and men are often as capricious as women--or\\naccount for it as you will, his restlessness at this period was truly\\nremarkable. Not a day that he did not spend his time in walking the\\nstreets, and that not in his usual aimless gentlemanly fashion, but\\neagerly and with an intent gaze that roamed here and there, like a bird\\nseeking its prey. It would often be as late as five o’clock before he\\ncame in, and if, as now frequently happened, he did not have company to\\ndinner, he was even known to start out again after seven o’clock and go\\nover the same ground as in the morning, looking with strained gaze, that\\nvainly endeavored to appear unconcerned, into the faces of the women\\nthat he passed. I not unfrequently followed him at these times as much\\nfor my own amusement as from any hope I had of coming upon anything that\\nshould aid me in the work before me. But when he suddenly changed his\\nroute of travel from a promenade in the fashionable thoroughfares of\\nBroadway and Fourteenth Street to a walk through Chatham Square and the\\ndark, narrow streets of the East side, I began to scent whom the prey\\nmight be that he was seeking, and putting every other consideration\\naside, regularly set myself to dog his steps, as only I, with my\\ninnumerable disguises, knew how to do. For three separate days I kept at\\nhis heels wherever he went, each day growing more and more astonished\\nif not to say hopeful, as I found myself treading the narrowest and most\\ndisreputable streets of the city; halting at the shops of pawnbrokers;\\npeering into the back-rooms of liquor shops; mixing with the crowds that\\ninfest the corner groceries at nightfall, and even slinking with hand on\\nthe trigger of the pistol I carried in my pocket, up dark alleys where\\nevery door that swung noiselessly to and fro as we passed, shut upon\\nhaunts of such villainy as only is known to us of the police, or to\\nthose good souls that for the sake of One whose example they follow, lay\\naside their fears and sensitiveness to carry light into the dim pits of\\nthis wretched world. At first I thought Mr. Blake might have some such\\nreason for the peculiar course he took. But his indifference to all\\ncrowds where only men were collected, his silence where a word would\\nhave been well received, convinced me it was a woman he was seeking and\\nthat with an intentness which blinded him to the commonest needs of the\\nhour. I even saw him once in his hurry and abstraction, step across the\\nbody of a child who had fallen face downward on the stones, and that\\nwith an expression showing he was utterly unconscious of anything but an\\nobstacle in his path. The strangest part of it all was that he seemed to\\nhave no fear. To be sure he took pains to leave his watch at home; but\\nwith such a figure and carriage as he possessed, the absence of jewelry\\ncould never deceive the eye for a moment as to the fact of his being\\na man of wealth, and those he went among would do anything for money.\\nPerhaps, like me, he carried a pistol. At all events he shunned no spot\\nwhere either poverty lay hid or deviltry reigned, his proud stern head\\nbending to enter the lowest doors without a tremble of the haughty lips\\nthat remained compressed as by an iron force; except when some poor\\nforlorn creature with flaunting head-gear, and tremulous hands,\\nattracted by his bearing would hastily brush against him, when he would\\nturn and look, perhaps speak, though what he said I always failed to\\ncatch; after which he would hurry on as if possessed by seven devils.\\nThe evenings of those three days were notable also. Two of them he\\nspent in the manner I have described; the third he went to the Windsor\\nHouse--where the Countess De Mirac had taken rooms--going up to the\\nladies’ entrance and actually ringing the bell, only to start back and\\nwalk up and down on the opposite side of the way, with his hands behind\\nhis back, and his head bent, evidently deliberating as to whether he\\nshould or should not carry out his original intention of entering. The\\narrival of a carriage with the stately subject of his deliberations,\\nwho from her elaborate costume had seemingly been to some kettledrum or\\nprivate reception, speedily put an end to his doubts. As the door opened\\nto admit her, I saw him cast one look at her heavily draped person, with\\nits snowy opera-cloak drawn tightly over the sweeping folds of her maize\\ncolored silk, and shrink back with what sounded like a sigh of anger or\\ndistrust, and without waiting for the closing of the door upon her, turn\\ntoward home with a step that hesitated no longer.\\n\\nThe fourth day to my infinite chagrin, I was sick and could not go with\\nhim. All I could do was to wrap myself in blankets and sit in my window\\nfrom which I had the satisfaction of viewing him start as I supposed\\nupon his usual course. The rest of the day was employed in a long,\\ndull waiting for his return, only relieved by casual glimpses of Mrs.\\nDaniels’ troubled face as she appeared at one window or another of\\nthe old-fashioned mansion before me. She seemed, too, to be unusually\\nrestless, opening the windows and looking out with forlorn cranings of\\nher neck as if she too were watching for her master. Indeed I have\\nno doubt from what I afterwards learned, that she was in a state of\\nconstant suspense during these days. Her frequent appearance at the\\nstation house, where she in vain sought for some news of the girl in\\nwhose fate she was so absorbed, confirmed this. Only the day before I\\ngave myself up to my unreserved espionage of Mr. Blake, she had had an\\ninterview with Mr. Gryce in which she had let fall her apprehensions\\nthat the girl was dead, and asked whether if that were the case, the\\npolice would be likely to come into a knowledge of the fact. Upon being\\nassured that if she had not been privately made way with, there was\\nevery chance in their favor, she had grown a little calmer, but before\\ngoing away had so far forgotten herself as to intimate that if some\\nresult was not reached before another fortnight had elapsed, she should\\ntake the matter into her own hands and--She did not say what she would\\ndo, but her looks were of a very menacing character. It was no wonder,\\nthen, that her countenance bore marks of the keenest anxiety as she\\ntrod the halls of that dim old mansion, with its dusky corners rich\\nwith bronzes and the glimmering shine of ancient brocades, breathing\\nsuggestions of loss and wrong; or bent her wrinkled forehead to gaze\\nfrom the windows for the coming of one whose footsteps were ever\\ndelayed. She happened to be looking out, when after a longer stroll than\\nusual the master of the house returned. As he made his appearance at the\\ncorner, I saw her hurriedly withdraw her head and hide herself behind\\nthe curtain, from which position she watched him as with tired steps and\\nsomewhat dejected mien, he passed up the steps and entered the house.\\nNot till the door closed upon him, did she venture to issue forth and\\nwith a hurried movement shut the blinds and disappear. This anxiety on\\nher part redoubled mine, and thankful enough was I when on the next day\\nI found myself well enough to renew my operations. To ferret out this\\nmystery, if mystery it was,--I still found myself forced to admit the\\npossibility of there being none--had now become the one ambition of my\\nlife; and all because it was not only an unusually blind one, but of a\\nnature that involved danger to my position as detective, I entered upon\\nit with a zest rare even to me who love my work and all it involves with\\nan undivided passion.\\n\\nTo equip myself, then, in a fresh disguise and to join Mr. Blake shortly\\nafter he had left his own corner, was anything but a hardship to me that\\nbright winter morning, though I knew from past experience, a long and\\nwearisome walk was before me with nothing in all probability at the\\nend but reiterated disappointment. But for once the fates had willed\\nit otherwise. Whether Mr. Blake, discouraged at the failure of his own\\nattempts, whatever they were, felt less heart to prosecute them than\\nusual I cannot say, but we had scarcely entered upon the lower end of\\nthe Bowery, before he suddenly turned with a look of disgust, and\\ngazing hurriedly about him, hailed a Madison Avenue car that was rapidly\\napproaching. I was at that moment on the other side of the way, but I\\nhurried forward too, and signaled the same car. But just as I was on the\\npoint of entering it I perceived Mr. Blake step hastily back and with\\nhis eyes upon a girl that was hurrying past him with a basket on her\\narm, regain the sidewalk with a swiftness that argued his desire to stop\\nher. Of course I let the car pass me, though I did not dare approach him\\ntoo closely after my late conspicuous attempt to enter it with him. But\\nfrom my stand on the opposite curb-stone I saw him draw aside the girl,\\nwho from her garments might have been the daughter or wife of any one\\nof the shiftless, drinking wretches lounging about on the four corners\\nwithin my view, and after talking earnestly with her for a few moments,\\nsaunter at her side down Broome Street, still talking. Reckless at this\\nsight of the consequences which might follow his detection of the part\\nI was playing, I hasted after them, when I was suddenly disconcerted by\\nobserving him hurriedly separate from the girl and turn towards me with\\nintention as it were to regain the corner he had left. Weighing in an\\ninstant the probable good to be obtained by following either party,\\nI determined to leave Mr. Blake for one day to himself, and turn my\\nattention to the girl he had addressed, especially as she was tall and\\nthin and bore herself with something like grace.\\n\\nBarely bestowing a glance upon him, then, as he passed, in a vain\\nattempt to read the sombre expression of his inscrutable face grown\\nfive years older in the last five days, I shuffled after the girl now\\nflitting before me down Broome Street. As I did so, I noticed her dress\\nto its minutest details, somewhat surprised to find how ragged and\\nuncouth it was. That Mr. Blake should stop a girl wherever seen, clad\\nin a black alpaca frock, a striped shawl and a Bowery hat trimmed with\\nfeathers, I could easily understand; but that this creature with her\\nfaded calico dress, dingy cape thrown carelessly over her head, and\\nragged basket, should arrest his attention, was a riddle to me. I\\nhastened forward with intent to catch a glimpse of her countenance if\\npossible; but she seemed to have acquired wings to her feet since her\\ninterview with Mr. Blake. Darting into a crowd of hooting urchins that\\nwere rushing from Centre Street after a broken wagon and runaway horse,\\nshe sped from my sight with such rapidity, I soon saw that my only hope\\nof overtaking her lay in running. I accordingly quickened my steps when\\nthose same hooting youngsters getting in the way of my feet, I tripped\\nup and--well, I own I retired from that field baffled. Not entirely so,\\nhowever. Just as I was going down, I caught sight of the girl tearing\\naway from a box of garbage on the curb-stone; and when order having\\nbeen restored, by which lofty statement I mean to say when your humble\\nservant had regained his equilibrium, I awoke to the fact that she had\\neffectually disappeared, I hurried to that box and succeeded in finding\\nhanging to it a bit of rag easily recognized as a piece of the old\\ncalico frock of nameless color which I had been following a moment\\nbefore. Regarding it as the sole spoils of a very unsatisfactory day’s\\nwork, I put it carefully away in my pocket book, where it lay till--But\\nwith all my zeal for compression, I must not anticipate.\\n\\nWhen I came home that afternoon I found myself unexpectedly involved in\\na matter that for the remainder of the day at least, prevented me from\\nfurther attending to the affair I had in hand. The next morning Mr.\\nBlake did not start out as usual, and at noon I received intimation\\nfrom Fanny that he was preparing to take a journey. Where, she could\\nnot inform me, nor when, though she thought it probable he would take an\\nearly train. Mrs. Daniels was feeling dreadfully, she informed me; and\\nthe house was like a grave. Greatly excited at this unexpected move on\\nMr. Blake’s part, I went home and packed my valise with something of the\\nspirit of her who once said, under somewhat different circumstances I\\nallow, “Whither thou goest I will go.”\\n\\nThe truth was, I had travelled so far and learned so little, that\\nmy professional pride was piqued. That expression of Mr. Gryce still\\nrankled, and nothing could soothe my injured spirit now but success.\\nAccordingly when Mr. Blake stepped up to the ticket office of the Hudson\\nRiver Railroad next morning, to buy a ticket for Putney, a small town\\nin the northern part of Vermont, he found beside him a spruce\\nyoung drummer, or what certainly appeared such, who by some strange\\ncoincidence, wanted a ticket for the same place. The fact did not seem\\nin the least to surprise him, nor did he cast me a look beyond the\\nordinary glance of one stranger at another. Indeed Mr. Blake had no\\nappearance of being a suspicious man, nor do I think at this time,\\nhe had the remotest idea that he was either watched or followed; an\\nignorance of the truth which I took care to preserve by taking my seat\\nin a different car from him and not showing myself again during the\\nwhole ride from New York to Putney.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. THE HOUSE AT THE GRANBY CROSS ROADS\\n\\n\\nWhy Mr. Blake should take a journey at all at this time, and why of\\nall places in the world he should choose such an insignificant town\\nas Putney for his destination, was of course the mystery upon which I\\nbrooded during the entire distance. But when somewhere near five in the\\nafternoon I stepped from the cars on to the platform at Putney Station\\nonly to hear Mr. Blake making inquiries in regard to a certain stage\\nrunning between that town and a still smaller village further east, I\\nown I was not only surprised but well-nigh nonplussed. Especially as\\nhe seemed greatly disappointed to hear that it only ran once a day, and\\nthen for an earlier train in the morning.\\n\\n“You will have to wait till to-morrow I fear,” said the ticket agent,\\n“unless the landlord of the hotel down yonder, can harness you up a\\nteam. There is a funeral out west to-day and--”\\n\\nI did not wait to hear more but hurried down to the hotel he had pointed\\nout, and hunting up the landlord inquired if for love or money he could\\nget me any sort of a conveyance for Melville that afternoon. He assured\\nme it would be impossible, the livery stable as well as his own being\\nentirely empty.\\n\\n“Such a thing don’t happen here once in five years,” said he to me. “But\\nthe old codger who is dead, though a queer dick was a noted personage in\\nthese parts, and not a man, woman or child, who could find a horse, mule\\nor donkey, but what availed himself of the privilege. Even the doctor’s\\nspavined mare was pressed into service, though she halts on one leg and\\nstops to get her breath half a dozen times in going up one short hill.\\nYou will have to wait for the stage, sir.”\\n\\n“But I am in a hurry,” said I as I saw Mr. Blake enter. “I have business\\nin Melville tonight, and I would pay anything in reason to get there.”\\n\\nBut the landlord only shook his head; and drawing back with the air of\\nan abused man, I took up my stand in the doorway where I could hear the\\nsame colloquy entered into with Mr. Blake, with the same unsatisfactory\\ntermination. He did not take it quite as calmly as I did, though he\\nwas of too reserved a nature to display much emotion over anything.\\nThe prospect of a long tedious evening spent in a country hotel seemed\\nalmost unendurable to him, but he finally succumbed to the force of\\ncircumstances, as indeed he seemed obliged to do, and partaking of such\\nrefreshment as the rather poorly managed hotel afforded, retired without\\nceremony to his room, from which he did not emerge again till next\\nmorning. In all this he had somehow managed not to give his name; and by\\nmeans of some inquiries I succeeded in making that evening, I found his\\nperson was unknown in the town.\\n\\nBy a little management I secured the next room to his, by which\\narrangement I succeeded in passing a sleepless night, Mr. Blake spending\\nmost of the wee sma’ hours in pacing the floor of his room, with an\\nunremitting regularity that had anything but a soothing effect upon my\\nnerves. Early the next morning we took the stage, he sitting on the back\\nseat, and I in front with the driver. There were other passengers, but\\nI noticed he never spoke to any of them, nor through all the long drive\\ndid he once look up from the corner where he had ensconced himself. It\\nwas twelve o’clock when we reached the end of the route, a small town\\nof somewhat less than the usual pretensions of mountain villages; so\\ninsignificant indeed, that I found it more and more difficult to imagine\\nwhat the wealthy ex-Congressman could find in such a spot as this, to\\nmake amends for a journey of such length and discomfort; when to my\\nincreasing wonder I heard him give orders for a horse to be saddled and\\nbrought round to the inn door directly after dinner. This was a move I\\nhad not expected and it threw me a little aback, for although I had thus\\nfar managed to hold myself so aloof from Mr. Blake, even while keeping\\nhim under my eye, that no suspicion of my interest in his movements had\\nas yet been awakened, how could I thus for the third time follow his\\norder with one precisely similar, without attracting an attention that\\nwould be fatal to my plans. Yet to let him ride off alone now, would be\\nto drop the trail at the very moment the scent became of importance.\\n\\nThe landlord, a bustling, wiry little man all nervousness and questions,\\nunwittingly helped me at this crisis.\\n\\n“Are you going on to Perry, sir?” inquired he of that gentleman, “I have\\nbeen expecting a man along these three days bound for Perry.”\\n\\n“I am that man,” I broke in, stepping forward with some appearance of\\nasperity, “and I hope you won’t keep me waiting. A horse as soon as\\ndinner is over, do you hear? I am two days late now, and won’t stand any\\nnonsense.”\\n\\nAnd to escape the questions sure to follow, I strode into the\\ndining-room with a half-fierce, half-sullen countenance, that\\neffectually precluded all advances. During the meal I saw Mr. Blake’s\\neye roam more than once towards my face; but I did not return his gaze,\\nor notice him in any way; hurrying through my dinner, and mounting the\\nfirst horse brought around, as if time were my only consideration. But\\nonce on the road I took the first opportunity to draw rein and wait,\\nsuddenly remembering that I had not heard Mr. Blake give any intimation\\nof the direction he intended taking. A few minutes revealed to me his\\nelegant form well mounted and showing to perfection in his closely\\nbuttoned coat, slowly approaching up the road. Taking advantage of\\na rise in the ground, I lingered till he was almost upon me, when I\\ncantered quickly on, fearing to arouse his apprehensions if I allowed\\nhim to pass me on a road so solitary as that which now stretched out\\nbefore us: a move provocative of much embarassment to me, as I dared not\\nturn my head for the same reason, anxious as I was to keep him in sight.\\n\\nThe roads dividing before me, at length gave me my first opportunity\\nto pause and look back. He was some fifty paces behind. Waiting till he\\ncame up, I bowed with the surly courtesy I thought in keeping with the\\ncharacter I had assumed, and asked if he knew which road led towards\\nPerry, saying I had come off in such haste I had forgotten to inquire my\\nway. He returned my bow, pointed towards the left hand road and saying,\\n“I know this does not,” calmly took it.\\n\\nNow here was a dilemma. If in face of this curt response I proceeded to\\nfollow him, my hand was revealed at once; yet the circumstances\\nwould admit of no other course. I determined to compromise matters by\\npretending to take the right hand road till he was out of sight, when I\\nwould return and follow him swiftly upon the left. Accordingly I reined\\nmy horse to the right, and for some fifteen minutes galloped slowly\\naway towards the north; but another fifteen saw me facing the west, and\\nriding with a force and fury of which I had not thought the old mare\\nthey had given me capable, till I put her to the test. It was not long\\nbefore I saw my fine gentleman trotting in front of me up a long but\\ngentle slope that rose in the distance; and slackening my own rein, I\\nwithdrew into the forest at the side of the road, till he had passed its\\nsummit and disappeared, when I again galloped forward.\\n\\nAnd thus we went on for an hour, over the most uneven country I ever\\ntraversed, he always one hill ahead; when suddenly, by what instinct I\\ncannot determine, I felt myself approaching the end, and hastening to\\nthe top of the ascent up which I was then laboring, looked down into the\\nshallow valley spread out before me.\\n\\nWhat a sight met my eyes if I had been intent on anything less practical\\nthan the movements of the solitary horseman below! Hills on hills piled\\nabout a verdant basin in whose depths nestled a scanty collection of\\nhouses, in number so small they could be told upon the fingers of the\\nright hand, but which notwithstanding lent an indescribable aspect of\\ncomfort to this remote region of hill and forest.\\n\\nBut the vision of Mr. Blake pausing half way down the slope before me,\\nexamining, yes examining a pistol which he held in his hand, soon put\\nan end to all ideas of romance. Somewhat alarmed I reined back; but his\\naction had evidently no connection with me, for he did not once glance\\nbehind him, but kept his eye on the road which I now observed took a\\nshort turn towards a house of so weird and ominous an appearance that I\\nscarcely marvelled at his precaution.\\n\\nSituated on a level track of land at the crossing of three roads, its\\nspacious front, rude and unpainted as it was, presented every appearance\\nof an inn, but from its moss-grown chimneys no smoke arose, nor could\\nI detect any sign of life in its shutterless windows and closed doors,\\nacross which shivered the dark shadow of the one gaunt and aged pine,\\nthat stood like a guard beside its tumbled-down porch.\\n\\nMr. Blake seemed to have been struck by the same fact concerning its\\nloneliness, for hurriedly replacing his pistol in his breast pocket, he\\nrode slowly forward. I instantly conceived the plan of striking across\\nthe belt of underbrush that separated me from this old dwelling, and by\\ntaking my stand opposite its front, intercept a view of Mr. Blake as\\nhe approached. Hastily dismounting, therefore, I led my horse into the\\nbushes and tied her to a tree, proceeding to carry out my plan on foot.\\nI was so far successful as to arrive at the further edge of the wood,\\nwhich was thick enough to conceal my presence without being too dense to\\nobstruct my vision, just as Mr. Blake passed on his way to this solitary\\ndwelling. He was looking very anxious, but determined. Turning my eyes\\nfrom him, I took another glance at the house, which by this movement I\\nhad brought directly before me. It was even more deserted-looking than\\nI had thought; its unpainted front with its double row of blank windows\\nmeeting your gaze without a response, while the huge old pine with half\\nits limbs dismantled of foliage, rattled its old bones against its sides\\nand moaned in its aged fashion like the solitary retainer of a dead\\nrace.\\n\\nI own I felt the cold shivers creep down my back as that creaking sound\\nstruck my ears, though as the day was chill with an east wind I dare say\\nit was more the effect of my sudden cessation from exercise, than of\\nany superstitious awe I felt. Mr. Blake seemed to labor under no such\\nimpressions. Riding up to the front door he knocked without dismounting,\\non its dismal panels with his riding whip. No response was heard.\\nKnitting his brows impatiently, he tried the latch: the door was locked.\\nHastily running his eye over the face of the building, he drew rein and\\nproceeded to ride around the house, which he could easily do owing\\nto the absence of every obstruction in the way of fence or shrubbery.\\nFinding no means of entrance he returned again to the front door which\\nhe shook with an impatient hand that however produced no impression\\nupon the trusty lock, and recognizing, doubtless, the futility of his\\nendeavors, he drew back, and merely pausing to give one other look at\\nits deserted front, turned his horse’s head, and to my great amazement,\\nproceeded with sombre mien and clouded brow to retake the road to\\nMelville.\\n\\nThis old inn or decayed homestead was then the object of his lengthened\\nand tedious journey; this ancient house rotting away among the bleak\\nhills of Vermont, the bourne towards which his steps had been tending\\nfor these past two days. I could not understand it. Rapidly emerging\\nfrom the spot where I had secreted myself, I in my turn made a circuit\\nof the house, if happily I should discover some loophole of entrance\\nwhich had escaped his attention. But every door and window was securely\\nbarred, and I was about to follow his example and leave the spot, when\\nI saw two or three children advancing towards me down the cross roads,\\ngaily swinging their school books. I noticed they hesitated and huddled\\ntogether as they approached and saw me, but not heeding this, I accosted\\nthem with a pleasant word or so, then pointing over my shoulder to the\\nhouse behind, asked who lived there. Instantly their already pale faces\\ngrew paler.\\n\\n“Why,” cried one, a boy, “don’t you know? That is where the two wicked\\nmen lived who stole the money out of the Rutland bank. They were put in\\nprison, but they got away and--”\\n\\nHere, the other, a little girl, plucked him by the sleeve with such\\naffright, that he himself took alarm and just giving me one quick stare\\nout of his wide eyes, grasped his companion by the hand and took to his\\nheels. As for myself I stood rooted to the ground in my astonishment.\\nThis blank, sleepy old house the home of the notorious Schoenmakers\\nafter whom half of the detectives of the country were searching? I could\\nscarcely credit my own ears. True I now remembered they had come from\\nthese parts, still--\\n\\nTurning round I eyed the house once more. How altered it looked to me!\\nWhat a murderous aspect it wore, and how dismally secret were the tight\\nshut windows and closely fastened doors, on one of which a rude cross\\nscrawled in red chalk met the eye with a mysterious significance. Even\\nthe old pine had acquired the villainous air of the uncanny repositor of\\nsecrets too dreadful to reveal, as it groaned and murmured to itself in\\nthe keen east wind. Dark deeds and foul wrong seemed written all over\\nthe fearful place, from the long strings of black moss that clung to\\nthe worm-eaten eaves, to the worn stone with its great blotch of\\nsomething,--could it have been blood?--that served as a threshold to\\nthe door. Suddenly with the quickness of lightning the thought flashed\\nacross me, what could Mr. Blake, the aristocratic representative of New\\nYork’s oldest family, have wanted in this nest of infamy? What errand\\nof hope, fear, despair, avarice or revenge, could have brought this\\nsuperior gentleman with his refined tastes and proudly reticent manners,\\nso many miles from home, to the forsaken den of a brace of hardy\\nvillains whose name for two years now, had stood as the type of all that\\nwas bold, bad and lawless, and for whom during the last six weeks the\\nprison had yawned, and the gallows hungered. Contemplation brought\\nno reply, and shocked at my own thoughts, I put the question by for\\nsteadier brains than mine; and instead of trying further to solve it,\\ncast about how I was to gain entrance into this deserted building; for\\nto enter it I was more than ever determined, now that I had heard to\\nwhom it had once belonged.\\n\\nExamining with a glance the several roads that branched off in every\\ndirection from where I stood, I found them all equally deserted. Even\\nthe school children had disappeared in some one of the four or five\\nhouses scattered in the remote distance.\\n\\nIf I was willing to enter upon any daring exploit, there was no one to\\nobserve or interrupt. I resolved to make the attempt with which my mind\\nwas full. This was to climb the old tree, and from one of the two or\\nthree branches that brushed against the house, gain entrance at an\\nopen garret window that stared at me from amid the pine’s dark needles.\\nTaking off my coat with a sigh over the immaculate condition of my new\\ncassimere trousers, I bent my energies to the task. A difficult one you\\nwill say for a city lad, but thanks to fortune I was not brought up in\\nNew York, and know how to climb trees with the best. With little more\\nthan a scratch or so, I reached the window of which I have spoken,\\nand after a moment spent in regaining my breath, gave one spring and\\naccomplished my purpose. I alighted upon a heap of broken glass in a\\nlarge bare room. An ominous chill at once struck to my heart. Though\\nI am anything but a sensitive man as far as physical impressions are\\nconcerned, there was something in the hollow echo that arose from the\\nfour blank walls about me as my feet alighted on that rough, uncarpeted\\nfloor, that struck a vague chill through my blood, and I actually\\nhesitated for the moment whether to pursue the investigations I had\\npromised myself, or beat a hasty retreat. A glance at the huge distorted\\nlimbs swaying across the square of the open window decided me. It\\nwas easy to enter by means of that unsteady support, but it would be\\nextremely unsafe to venture forth in that way. If I prized life and limb\\nI must seek some other method of egress. I at once put my apprehensions\\nin my pocket and entered upon my self imposed task.\\n\\nA single glance was sufficient to exhaust the resources of the empty\\ngarret in which I found myself. Two or three old chairs piled in one\\ncorner, a rusty stove or so, a heap of tattered and decaying clothing,\\nwere all that met my gaze. Taking my way, then, at once to the ladder,\\nwhose narrow ends projecting above a hole in the garret floor, seemed\\nto proffer the means of reaching the rooms below, I proceeded to descend\\ninto what to my excited imagination looked like a gulf of darkness. It\\nproved, however, to be nothing more nor less than an unlighted hall of\\nsmall dimensions, with a stair-case at one end and a door at the other,\\nwhich, upon opening I found myself in a large, square room whose immense\\nfour-post bedstead entirely denuded of its usual accompaniments of bed\\nand bolster at once struck my eye and for a moment held it enchained.\\nThere were other articles in the room; a disused bureau, a rocking\\nchair, even a table, but nothing had such a ghostly look as that antique\\nbedstead with its curtains of calico tied back over its naked framework,\\nlike rags draped from the bare bones of a skeleton. Passing hurriedly\\nby, I tried a closet door or so, finding little, however, to reward my\\nsearch; and eager to be done with what was every moment becoming more\\nand more drearisome, I hastened across the floor to the front of the\\nhouse where I found another hall and a row of rooms that, while not\\nentirely stripped of furniture, were yet sufficiently barren to\\noffer little encouragement to my curiosity. One only, a small but not\\nuncomfortable apartment, showed any signs of having been occupied within\\na reasonable length of time; and as I paused before its hastily spread\\nbed, thrown together as only a man would do it, and wondering why the\\nroom was so dark, looked up and saw that the window was entirely covered\\nby an old shawl and a couple of heavy coats that had been hastily nailed\\nacross it, I own I felt my hand go to my breast pocket almost as if I\\nexpected to see the wild faces of the dreaded Schoenmakers start up all\\naglare from one of the dim corners before me. Rushing to the window, I\\ntore down with one sweep of my arm both coat and shawl, and with a start\\ndiscovered that the window still possessed its draperies in the shape of\\na pair of discolored and tattered curtains tied with ribbons that must\\nonce have been brilliant and cheery of color.\\n\\nNor was this the only sign in the room of a bygone presence that had\\npossessed a taste for something beyond the mere necessities of life.\\nOn the grim coarsely papered wall hung more than one picture; cut from\\npictorial newspapers to be sure, but each and every one, if I may be\\ncalled a judge of such matters, possessing some quality of expression to\\ncommend it to a certain order of taste. They were all strong pictures.\\nVivid faces of men and women in daring positions; a hunter holding back\\na jaguar from his throat; a soldier protecting his comrade from the\\nstroke; and most striking of all, a woman lissome as she was powerful,\\nstarting aghast and horror stricken from--what? I could not tell; a\\nrough hand had stripped the remainder of the picture from the wall.\\n\\nA bit of candle and a half sheet of a newspaper lay on the floor. I\\npicked up the paper. It was a Rutland Herald and bore the date of two\\ndays before. As I read I realized what I had done. If these daring\\nrobbers were not at this very moment in the house, they had been there,\\nand that within two or three days. The broken panes of glass in the\\ngarret above were now explained. I was not the first one who had climbed\\nthat creaking pine tree this fall.\\n\\nSomething like a sensible dread of a very possible danger now seized\\nhold of me. If I had stumbled upon these strangely subtile, yet\\ndevilishly bold creatures in their secret lair, the pistol I carried was\\nnot going to save me. Shut in like a fox in a hole, I had little to hope\\nfor, if they once made their appearance at the stairhead or came upon me\\nfrom any of the dim halls of the crazy old dwelling, which I now began\\nto find altogether too large for my comfort. Stealing cautiously forth\\nfrom the room in which I had found so much to disconcert me, I crept\\ntowards the front staircase and listened. All was deathly quiet. The\\nold pine tree moaned and twisted without, and from time to time the wind\\ncame sweeping down the chimney with an unearthly shrieking sound that\\nwas weirdly in keeping with the place. But within and below all was\\nstill as the tomb, and though in no ways reassured, I determined to\\ndescend and have the suspense over at once. I did so, pistol in hand\\nand ears stretched to their utmost to catch the slightest rustle, but no\\nsound came to disturb me, nor did I meet on this lower floor the sign of\\nany other presence in the house but my own. Passing hastily through what\\nappeared to be a sort of rude parlor, I stepped into the kitchen and\\ntried one of the windows. Finding I could easily lift it from the\\ninside, I drew my breath with ease for the first time since I had\\nalighted among the broken glass above, and turning back, deliberately\\nopened the door of the kitchen stove, and looked in. As I half expected,\\nI found a pile of partly charred rags, showing where the wretches had\\nburned their prison clothing, and proceeding further, picked up from\\nthe ashes a ring which whether or not they were conscious of having\\nattempted to destroy in this way I cannot say, but which I thankfully\\nput in my pocket against the day it might be required as proof.\\n\\nDiscerning nothing more in that quarter inviting interest, I asked\\nmyself if I had nerve to descend into the cellar. Finally concluding\\nthat that was more than could be expected from any man in my position, I\\ngave one look of farewell to the damp and desolate walls about me, then\\nwith a breath of relief jumped from the kitchen window again into the\\nlight and air of day. As I did so I could swear I heard a door within\\nthat old house swing on its hinges and softly close. With a thrill I\\nrecognized the fact that it came from the cellar.\\n\\n                        *      *      *      *\\n\\nMy thoughts on the road back to Melville were many and conflicting.\\nChief above them all, however, rose the comfortable conclusion that in\\nthe pursuit of one mysterious affair, I had stumbled, as is often the\\ncase, upon the clue to another of yet greater importance, and by so\\ndoing got a start that might yet redound greatly to my advantage. For\\nthe reward offered for the recapture of the Schoenmakers was large, and\\nthe possibility of my being the one to put the authorities upon their\\ntrack, certainly appeared after this day’s developements, open at least\\nto a very reasonable hope. At all events I determined not to let the\\ngrass grow under my feet till I had informed the Superintendent of what\\nI had seen and heard that day in the old haunt of these two escaped\\nconvicts.\\n\\nArrived at the public house in Melville, and learning that Mr. Blake had\\nsafely returned there an hour before, I drew the landlord to one side\\nand asked what he could tell me about that old house of the two noted\\nrobbers Schoenmaker, I had passed on my way back among the hills.\\n\\n“Wa’al now,” replied he, “this is curious. Here I’ve just been answering\\nthe gentleman up stairs a heap of questions concerning that self same\\nold place, and now you come along with another batch of them; just as\\nif that rickety old den was the only spot of interest we had in these\\nparts.”\\n\\n“Perhaps that may be the truth,” I laughed. “Just now when the papers\\nare full of these rogues, anything concerning them must be of superior\\ninterest of course.” And I pressed him again to give me a history of the\\nhouse and the two thieves who had inhabited it.\\n\\n“Wa’al,” drawled he “‘taint much we know about them, yet after all it\\nmay be a trifle too much for their necks some day. Time was when nobody\\nthought especial ill of them beyond a suspicion or so of their being\\nsomewhat mean about money. That was when they kept an inn there, but\\nwhen the robbery of the Rutland bank was so clearly traced to them,\\nmore than one man about here started up and said as how they had\\nalways suspected them Shoenmakers of being villains, and even hinted at\\nsomething worse than robbery. But nothing beyond that one rascality has\\nyet been proved against them, and for that they were sent to jail for\\ntwenty years as you know. Two months ago they escaped, and that is the\\nlast known of them. A precious set, too, they are; the father being only\\nso much the greater rogue than the son as he is years older.”\\n\\n“And the inn? When was that closed?”\\n\\n“Just after their arrest.”\\n\\n“Has’nt it been opened since?”\\n\\n“Only once when a brace of detectives came up from Troy to investigate,\\nas they called it.”\\n\\n“Who has the key?”\\n\\n“Ah, that’s more than I can tell you.”\\n\\nI dared not ask how my questions differed from those of Mr. Blake, nor\\nindeed touch upon that point in any way. I was chiefly anxious now\\nto return to New York without delay; so paying my bill I thanked the\\nlandlord, and without waiting for the stage, remounted my horse and\\nproceeded at once to Putney where I was fortunate enough to catch the\\nevening train. By five o’clock next morning I was in New York where I\\nproceeded to carry out my programme by hastening at once to headquarters\\nand reporting my suspicions regarding the whereabouts of the\\nSchoenmakers. The information was received with interest and I had\\nthe satisfaction of seeing two men despatched north that very day with\\norders to procure the arrest of the two notable villains wherever found.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. A WORD OVERHEARD\\n\\n\\nThat evening I had a talk with Fanny over the area gate. She came out\\nwhen she saw me approach, with her eyes staring and her whole form in a\\nflutter.\\n\\n“O,” she cried, “such things as I have heard this day!”\\n\\n“Well,” said I, “what? let me hear too.” She put her hand on her heart.\\n“I never was so frightened,” whispered she, “I thought I should have\\nfainted right away. To hear that elegant lady use such a word as\\ncrime,--”\\n\\n“What elegant lady?” interrupted I. “Don’t begin in the middle of your\\nstory, that’s a good girl; I want to hear it all.”\\n\\n“Well,” said she, calming down a little, “Mrs. Daniels had a visitor\\nto-day, a lady. She was dressed--”\\n\\n“O, now,” interrupted I for the second time, “you can leave that out.\\nTell me what her name was and let the fol-de-rols go.”\\n\\n“Her name?” exclaimed the girl with some sharpness, “how should I know\\nher name; she did’nt come to see me.”\\n\\n“How did she look then? You saw her I suppose?”\\n\\n“And was’nt that what I was telling you, when you stopped me. She looked\\nlike a queen, that she did; as grand a lady as ever I see, in her velvet\\ndress sweeping over the floor, and her diamonds as big as--”\\n\\n“Was she a dark woman?” I asked.\\n\\n“Her hair was black and so were her eyes, if that is what you mean.”\\n\\n“And was she very tall and proud looking?”\\n\\nThe girl nodded. “You know her?” whispered she.\\n\\n“No,” said I, “not exactly; but I think I can tell who she is. And so\\nshe called to-day on Mrs. Daniels, did she.”\\n\\n“Yes, but I guess she knew master would be home before she got away.”\\n\\n“Come,” said I, “tell me all about it; I’m getting impatient.”\\n\\n“And ain’t I telling you?” said she. “It was about three o’clock this\\nafternoon, the time I go up stairs to dress, so I just hangs about in\\nthe hall a bit, near the parlor door, and I hear her gossiping with Mrs.\\nDaniels almost as if she was an old friend, and Mrs. Daniels answering\\nher mighty stiffly and as if she was’nt glad to see her at all. But the\\nlady didn’t seem to mind, but went on talking as sweet as honey, and\\nwhen they came out, you would have thought she loved the old woman like\\na sister to see her look into her face and say something about knowing\\nhow busy she was, but that it would give her so much pleasure if she\\nwould come some day to see her and talk over old times. But Mrs. Daniels\\nwas’nt pleased a bit and showed plain enough she did’nt like the lady,\\nfine as she was in her ways. She was going to answer her too, but just\\nthen the front door opened and Mr. Blake with his satchel in his hand,\\ncame into the house. And how he did start, to be sure, when he saw them,\\nthough he tried to say something perlite which she did’nt seem to take\\nto at all, for after muttering something about not expecting to see him,\\nshe put her hand on the knob and was going right out. But he stopped her\\nand they went into the parlor together while Mrs. Daniels stood staring\\nafter them like one mad, her hand held out with his bag and umbrella in\\nit, stiff as a statter in the Central Park. She did’nt stand so long,\\nthough, but came running down the hall, as if she was bewitched. I was\\ndreadful flustered, for though I was hid behind the wall that juts out\\nthere by the back stairs, I was afraid she would see me and shame me\\nbefore Mr. Blake. But she passed right by and never looked up. ‘There is\\nsomething dreadful mysterious in this,’ thought I, and I just made up\\nmy mind to stay where I was till Mr. Blake and the lady should come out\\nagain from the parlor. I did’nt have to wait very long. In a few minutes\\nthe door opened and they stepped out, he ahead and she coming after. I\\nthought this was queer, he is always so dreadful perlite in his ways,\\nbut I thought it was a deal queerer when I saw him go up the front\\nstairs, she hurrying after, looking I cannot tell you how, but awful\\ntroubled and anxious, I should say.\\n\\n“They went into that room of his he calls his studio and though I knew\\nit might cost me my place if I was found out, I could’nt help following\\nand listening at the keyhole.”\\n\\n“And what did you hear?” I asked, for she paused to take breath.\\n\\n“Well, the first thing I heard was a cry of pleasure from her, and the\\nwords, ‘You keep that always before you? You cannot dislike me, then, as\\nmuch as you pretend.’ I don’t know what she meant nor what he did, but\\nhe stepped across the room and I heard her cry out this time as if she\\nwas hurt as well as awful surprised; and he talked and talked, and I\\ncould’nt catch a word, he spoke so low; and by and by she sobbed just a\\nlittle, and I got scared and would have run away but she cried out with\\na kind of shriek, ‘O, don’t say any more; to think that crime should\\ncome into our family, the proudest in the land. How could you, Holman,\\nhow could you.’ Yes,” the girl went on, flushing in her excitement till\\nshe was as red as the cherry ribbons in her cap, “those were the very\\nwords she used: ‘To think that crime should come into our family! the\\nproudest one in the land!’ And she called him by his first name, and\\nasked him how he could do it.”\\n\\n“And what did Mr. Blake say?” returned I, a little taken back myself at\\nthis result of my efforts with Fanny.\\n\\n“O, I did’nt wait to hear. I did’nt wait for anything. If folks was\\ngoing to talk about such things as that, I thought I had better be\\nanywhere than listening at the keyhole. I went right up stairs I can\\ntell you.”\\n\\n“And whom have you told of what you heard in the half dozen hours that\\nhave gone by?”\\n\\n“Nobody; how could you think so mean of me when I promised, and--”\\n\\nIt is not necessary to go any further into this portion of the\\ninterview.\\n\\nThe Countess De Mirac possessed to its fullest extent the present fine\\nlady’s taste for bric-a-brac. So much I had learned in my inquiries\\nconcerning her. Remembering this, I took the bold resolution of\\nprofiting by this weakness of hers to gain admission to her presence,\\nshe being the only one sharing Mr. Blake’s mysterious secret. Borrowing\\na valuable antique from a friend of mine at that time in the business,\\nI made my appearance the very next day at her apartments, and sending\\nin an urgent request to see Madame, by the trim negress who answered my\\nsummons, waited in some doubt for her reply.\\n\\nIt came all too soon; Madame was ill and could see no one. I was not,\\nhowever, to be baffled by one rebuff. Handing the basket I held to the\\ngirl, I urged her to take it in and show her mistress what it contained,\\nsaying it was a rare article which might never again come her way.\\n\\nThe girl complied, though with a doubtful shake of the head which was\\nanything but encouraging. Her incredulity, however, must have been\\nspeedily rebuked, for she almost immediately returned without the\\nbasket, saying Madame would see me.\\n\\nMy first thoughts upon entering the grand lady’s presence, was that the\\ngirl had been mistaken, for I found the Countess walking the floor in an\\nabstracted way, drying a letter she had evidently but just completed, by\\nshaking it to and fro with an unsteady hand; the placque I had brought,\\nlying neglected on the table.\\n\\nBut at sight of my respectful form standing with bent head in the\\ndoorway, she hurriedly thrust the letter into a book and took up the\\nplacque. As she did so I marked her well and almost started at the\\nchange I observed in her since that evening at the Academy. It was not\\nonly that she was dressed in some sort of loose dishabille that was\\nin eminent contrast to the sweeping silks and satins in which I had\\nhitherto beheld her adorned; or that she was laboring under some\\nphysical disability that robbed her dark cheek of the bloom that was its\\nchiefest charm. The change I observed went deeper than that; it was more\\nas if a light had been extinguished in her countenance. It was the same\\nwoman I had beheld standing like a glowing column of will and strength\\nbefore the melancholy form of Mr. Blake, but with the will and strength\\ngone, and with them all the glow.\\n\\n“She no longer hopes,” thought I, and already felt repaid for my\\ntrouble.\\n\\n“This is a very pretty article you have brought me,” said she with\\nsomething of the unrestrained love of art which she undoubtedly\\npossessed, showing itself through all her languor. “Where did it come\\nfrom, and what recommendations have you, to prove it is an honest sale\\nyou offer me?”\\n\\n“None,” returned I, ignoring with a reassuring smile the first question,\\n“except that I should not be afraid if all the police in New York knew I\\nwas here with this fine placque for sale.”\\n\\nShe gave a shrug of her proud shoulder that bespoke the French Countess\\nand softly ran her finger round the edge of the placque.\\n\\n“I don’t need anything more of this kind,” said she languidly;\\n“besides,” and she set it down with a fretful air, “I am in no mood to\\nbuy this afternoon.” Then shortly, “What do you ask for it?”\\n\\nI named a fabulous price.\\n\\nShe started and cast me a keen glance. “You had better take it to some\\none else; I have no money to throw away.”\\n\\nWith a hesitating hand I lifted the placque towards the basket. “I would\\nvery much like to sell it to you,” said I. “Perhaps--”\\n\\nJust then a lady’s fluttering voice rose from the room beyond inquiring\\nfor the Countess, and hurriedly taking the placque from my hand with\\nan impulsive “O there’s Amy,” she passed into the adjoining apartment,\\nleaving the door open behind her.\\n\\nI saw a quick interchange of greetings between her and a fashionably\\ndressed lady, then they withdrew to one side with the ornament I had\\nbrought, evidently consulting in regard to its merits. Now was my time.\\nThe book in which she had placed the letter she had been writing lay on\\nthe table right before me, not two inches from my hand. I had only\\nto throw back the cover and my curiosity would be satisfied. Taking\\nadvantage of a moment when their backs were both turned, I pressed open\\nthe book with a careful hand, and with one eye on them and one on the\\nsheet before me, managed to read these words:--\\n\\n\\n    MY DEAREST CECILIA.\\n\\n    I have tried in vain to match the sample you sent me at Stewart’s,\\n    Arnold’s and McCreery’s. If you still insist upon making up the\\n    dress in the way you propose, I will see what Madame Dudevant can\\n    do for us, though I cannot but advise you to alter your plans and\\n    make the darker shade of velvet do. I went to the Cary reception\\n    last night and met Lulu Chittenden. She has actually grown old,\\n    but was as lively as ever. She created a great stir in Paris when\\n    she was there; but a husband who comes home two o’clock in the\\n    morning with bleared eyes and empty pockets, is not conducive to\\n    the preservation of a woman’s beauty. How she manages to retain\\n    her spirits I cannot imagine. You ask me news of cousin Holman. I\\n    meet him occasionally and he looks well, but has grown into the\\n    most sombre man you ever saw. In regard to certain hopes of which\\n    you have sometimes made mention, let me assure you they are no\\n    longer practicable. He has done what--\\n\\nHere the conversation ceased in the other room, the Countess made a\\nmovement of advance and I closed the book with an inward groan over my\\nill-luck.\\n\\n“It is very pretty,” said she with a weary air; “but as I remarked\\nbefore, I am not in the buying mood. If you will take half you mention,\\nI may consider the subject, but--”\\n\\n“Pardon me, Madame,” I interrupted, being in no wise anxious to leave\\nthe placque behind me, “I have been considering the matter and I hold to\\nmy original price. Mr. Blake of Second Avenue may give it to me if you\\ndo not.”\\n\\n“Mr. Blake!” She eyed me suspiciously. “Do you sell to him?”\\n\\n“I sell to anyone I can,” replied I; “and as he has an artist’s eye for\\nsuch things--”\\n\\nHer brows knitted and she turned away. “I do not want it;” said she,\\n“sell it to whom you please.”\\n\\nI took up the placque and left the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. A FEW GOLDEN HAIRS\\n\\n\\nWhen a few days from that I made my appearance before Mr. Gryce, it was\\nto find him looking somewhat sober. “Those Schoenmakers,” said he, “are\\nmaking a deal of trouble. It seems they escaped the fellows up north and\\nare now somewhere in this city, but where--”\\n\\nAn expressive gesture finished the sentence.\\n\\n“Is that so?” exclaimed I. “Then we are sure to nab them. Given time and\\na pair of low, restless German thieves, I will wager anything, our hands\\nwill be upon them before the month is over. I only hope, when we do come\\nacross them, it will not be to find their betters too much mixed up with\\ntheir devilish practices.” And I related to him what Fanny had told me a\\nfew evenings before.\\n\\n“The coil is tightening,” said he. “What the end will be I don’t know.\\nCrime, said she? I wish I knew in what blind hole of the earth that girl\\nwe are after lies hidden.”\\n\\nAs if in answer to this wish the door opened and one of our men came\\nin with a letter in his hand. “Ha!” exclaimed Mr. Gryce, after he had\\nperused it, “look at that.”\\n\\nI took the letter from his hand and read:\\n\\n    The dead body of a girl such as you describe was found in the East\\n    river off Fiftieth Street this morning. From appearance has been\\n    dead some time. Have telegraphed to Police Headquarters for\\n    orders. Should you wish to see the body before it is removed to\\n    the Morgue or otherwise disturbed, please hasten to Pier 48 E. R.\\n                                                           GRAHAM.\\n\\n“Come,” said I, “let’s go and see for ourselves. If it should be the\\none--”\\n\\n“The dinner party proposed by Mr. Blake for to-night, may have its\\ninterruptions,” he remarked.\\n\\nI do not wish to make my story any longer than is necessary, but I must\\nsay that when in an hour or so later, I stood with Mr. Gryce before the\\nunconscious form of that poor drowned girl I felt an unusual degree\\nof awe stealing over me: there was so much mystery connected with this\\naffair, and the parties implicated were of such standing and repute.\\n\\nI almost dreaded to see the covering removed from her face lest I should\\nbehold, what? I could not have told if I had tried.\\n\\n“A trim made body enough,” cried the official in charge as Mr. Gryce\\nlifted an end of the cloth that enveloped her and threw it back. “Pity\\nthe features are not better preserved.”\\n\\n“No need for us to see the features,” exclaimed I, pointing to the locks\\nof golden red hair that hung in tangled masses about her. “The hair is\\nenough; she is not the one.” And I turned aside, asking myself if it was\\nrelief I felt.\\n\\nTo my surprise Mr. Gryce did not follow.\\n\\n“Tall, thin, white face, black eyes.” I heard him whisper to himself.\\n“It is a pity the features are not better preserved.”\\n\\n“But,” said I, taking him by the arm, “Fanny spoke particularly of\\nher hair being black, while this girl’s--Good heavens!” I suddenly\\nejaculated as I looked again at the prostrate form before me. “Yellow\\nhair or black, this is the girl I saw him speaking to that day in\\nBroome Street. I remember her clothes if nothing more.” And opening my\\npocketbook, I took out the morsel of cloth I had plucked that day from\\nthe ash barrel, lifted up the discolored rags that hung about the body\\nand compared the two. The pattern, texture and color were the same.\\n\\n“Well,” said Mr. Gryce, pointing to certain contusions, like marks from\\nthe blow of some heavy instrument on the head and bared arms of the girl\\nbefore us; “he will have to answer me one question anyhow, and that\\nis, who this poor creature is who lies here the victim of treachery or\\ndespair.” And turning to the official he asked if there were any other\\nsigns of violence on the body.\\n\\nThe answer came deliberately, “Yes, she has evidently been battered to\\ndeath.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce’s lips closed with grim decision. “A most brutal murder,” said\\nhe and lifting up the cloth with a hand that visibly trembled, he softly\\ncovered her face.\\n\\n“Well,” said I as we slowly paced back up the pier, “there is one thing\\ncertain, she is not the one who disappeared from Mr. Blake’s house.”\\n\\n“I am not so sure of that.”\\n\\n“How!” said I. “You believed Fanny lied when she gave that description\\nof the missing girl upon which we have gone till now?”\\n\\nMr. Gryce smiled, and turning back, beckoned to the official behind us.\\n“Let me have that description,” said he, “which I distributed among the\\nHarbor Police some days ago for the identification of a certain corpse I\\nwas on the lookout for.”\\n\\nThe man opened his coat and drew out a printed paper which at Mr.\\nGryce’s word he put into my hand. It ran as follows:\\n\\n    Look out for the body of a young girl, tall, well shaped but thin,\\n    of fair complexion and golden hair of a peculiar bright and\\n    beautiful color, and when found, acquaint me at once.\\n                                                            G.\\n\\n“I don’t understand,” began I.\\n\\nBut Mr. Gryce tapping me on the arm said in his most deliberate tones,\\n“Next time you examine a room in which anything of a mysterious nature\\nhas occurred, look under the bureau and if you find a comb there with\\nseveral long golden hairs tangled in it, be very sure before you draw\\nany definite conclusions, that your Fannys know what they are talking\\nabout when they declare the girl who used that comb had black hair on\\nher head.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. THE SECRET OF MR. BLAKE’S STUDIO\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Blake is at dinner, sir, with company, but I will call him if you\\nsay so.”\\n\\n“No,” returned Mr. Gryce; “show us into some room where we can be\\ncomfortable and we will wait till he has finished.”\\n\\nThe servant bowed, and stepping forward down the hall, opened the door\\nof a small and cosy room heavily hung with crimson curtains. “I will\\nlet him know that you are here,” said he, and vanished towards the\\ndining-room.\\n\\n“I doubt if Mr. Blake will enjoy the latter half of his bill of fare as\\nmuch as the first,” said I, drawing up one of the luxurious arm-chairs\\nto the side of my principal. “I wonder if he will break away from his\\nguests and come in here?”\\n\\n“No; if I am not mistaken we shall find Mr. Blake a man of nerve. Not a\\nmuscle of his face will show that he is disturbed.”\\n\\n“Well,” said I, “I dread it.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce looked about on the gorgeous walls and the rich old fashioned\\nfurniture that surrounded him, and smiled one of his grimmest smiles.\\n\\n“Well, you may,” said he.\\n\\nThe next instant a servant stood in the doorway, bearing to our great\\nastonishment, a tray well set with decanter and glasses.\\n\\n“Mr. Blake’s compliments, gentlemen,” said he, setting it down on the\\ntable before us. “He hopes you will make yourselves at home and he will\\nsee you as soon as possible.”\\n\\nThe humph! of Mr. Gryce when the servant had gone would have done your\\nsoul good, also the look he cast at the pretty Dresden Shepherdess on\\nthe mantel-piece, as I reached out my hand towards the decanter. Somehow\\nit made me draw back.\\n\\n“I think we had better leave his wine alone,” said he.\\n\\nAnd for half an hour we sat there, the wine untouched between us,\\nlistening alternately to the sound of speech-making and laughter that\\ncame from the dining-room, and the solemn ticking of the clock as it\\ncounted out the seconds on the mantel-piece. Then the guests came in\\nfrom the table, filing before us past the open door on their way to\\nthe parlors. They were all gentlemen of course--Mr. Blake never invited\\nladies to his house--and gentlemen of well known repute. The dinner had\\nbeen given in honor of a certain celebrated statesman, and the character\\nof his guests was in keeping with that of the one thus complimented.\\n\\nAs they went by us gaily indulging in the jokes and light banter with\\nwhich such men season a social dinner, I saw Mr. Gryce’s face grow sober\\nby many a shade; and when in the midst of it all, we heard the voice\\nof Mr. Blake rise in that courteous and measured tone for which it\\nis distinguished, I saw him reach forward and grasp his cane with an\\nuneasiness I had never seen displayed by him before. But when some time\\nlater, the guests having departed, the dignified host advanced with some\\napology to where we were, I never beheld a firmer look on Mr. Gryce’s\\nface than that with which he rose and confronted him. Mr. Blake’s own\\nhad not more character in it.\\n\\n“You have called at a rather inauspicious time, Mr. Gryce,” said the\\nlatter, glancing at the card which he held in his hand. “What may your\\nbusiness be? Something to do with politics, I suppose.”\\n\\nI surveyed the man in amazement. Was this great politician stooping\\nto act a part, or had he forgotten our physiognomies as completely as\\nappeared?\\n\\n“Our business is not politics,” replied Mr. Gryce; “but fully as\\nimportant. May I request the doors be closed?”\\n\\nI thought Mr. Blake looked surprised, but he immediately stepped to the\\ndoor and shut it. Then coming back, he looked at Mr. Gryce more closely\\nand a change took place in his manner.\\n\\n“I think I have seen you before,” said he.\\n\\nMr. Gryce bowed with just the suspicion of a smile. “I have had the\\nhonor of consulting you before in this very house,” observed he.\\n\\nA look of full recognition passed over the dignified countenance of the\\nman before us.\\n\\n“I remember,” said he, shrugging his shoulders in the old way. “You are\\ninterested in some servant girl or other who ran away from this house a\\nweek or so ago. Have you found her?” This with no apparent concern.\\n\\n“We think we have,” rejoined Mr. Gryce with some solemnity. “The river\\ngives up its prey now and then, Mr. Blake.”\\n\\nStill only that look of natural surprise.\\n\\n“Indeed! You do not mean to say she has drowned herself? I am sorry for\\nthat, a girl who had once lived in my house. What trouble could she have\\nhad to drive her to such an act?”\\n\\nMr. Gryce advanced a step nearer the gentleman.\\n\\n“That is what we have come here to learn,” said he with a deliberation\\nthat yet was not lacking in the respect due to a man so universally\\nesteemed as Mr. Blake. “You who have seen her so lately ought to be able\\nto throw some light upon the subject at least.”\\n\\n“Mr.--” he again glanced at the card, “Mr. Gryce,--excuse me--I believe\\nI told you when you were here before that I had no remembrance of this\\ngirl at all. That if such a person was in my house I did not know it,\\nand that all questions put to me on that subject would be so much labor\\nthrown away.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce bowed. “I remember,” said he. “I was not alluding to any\\nconnection you may have had with the girl in this house, but to the\\ninterview you were seen to have with her on the corner of Broome Street\\nsome days ago. You had such an interview, did you not?”\\n\\nA flush, deep as it was sudden, swept over Mr. Blake’s usually unmoved\\ncheek. “You are transgressing sir,” said he and stopped. Though a man of\\nintense personal pride, he had but little of that quality called temper,\\nor perhaps if he had, thought it unwise to display it on this occasion.\\n“I saw and spoke to a girl on the corner of that street some days ago,”\\n he went on more mildly, “but that she was the one who lived here,\\nI neither knew at the time nor feel willing to believe now without\\npositive proof.” Then in a deep ringing tone the stateliness of which it\\nwould be impossible to describe, he inquired, “Have the city authorities\\npresumed to put a spy on my movements, that the fact of my speaking to\\na poor forsaken creature on the corner of the street should be not only\\nnoted but remembered?”\\n\\n“Mr. Blake,” observed Mr. Gryce, and I declare I was proud of my\\nsuperior at that moment, “no man who is a true citizen and a\\nChristian should object to have his steps followed, when by his own\\nthoughtlessness, perhaps, he has incurred a suspicion which demands it.”\\n\\n“And do you mean to say that I have been followed,” inquired he,\\nclenching his hand and looking steadily, but with a blanching cheek,\\nfirst at Mr. Gryce then at me.\\n\\n“It was indispensable,” quoth that functionary gently.\\n\\nThe outraged gentleman riveted his gaze upon me. “In town and out of\\ntown?” demanded he.\\n\\nI let Mr. Gryce reply. “It is known that you have lately sought to visit\\nthe Schoenmakers,” said he.\\n\\nMr. Blake drew a deep breath, cast his eyes about the handsome apartment\\nin which we were, let them rest for a moment upon a portrait that graced\\none side of the wall, and which was I have since learned a picture of\\nhis father, and slowly drew forward a chair. “Let me hear what your\\nsuspicions are,” said he.\\n\\nI noticed Mr. Gryce colored at this; he had evidently been met in a\\ndifferent way from what he expected. “Excuse me,” said he, “I do not say\\nI have any suspicions; my errand is simply to notify you of the death of\\nthe girl you were seen to speak with, and to ask whether or not you\\ncan give us any information that can aid us in the matter before the\\ncoroner.”\\n\\n“You know I have not. If I have been as closely followed as you say, you\\nmust know why I spoke to that girl and others, why I went to the house\\nof the Schoenmakers and--Do you know?” he suddenly inquired.\\n\\nMr. Gryce was not the man to answer such a question as that. He eyed the\\nrich signet ring that adorned the hand of the gentleman before him and\\nsuavely smiled. “I am ready to listen to any explanations,” said he.\\n\\nMr. Blake’s haughty countenance became almost stern. “You consider you\\nhave a right to demand them; let me hear why.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Mr. Gryce with a change of tone, “you shall. Unprofessional\\nas it is, I will tell you why I, a member of the police force, dare\\nenter the house of such a man as you are, and put him the questions I\\nhave concerning his domestic affairs. Mr. Blake, imagine yourself in\\na detective’s office. A woman comes in, the housekeeper of a respected\\ncitizen, and informs us that a girl employed by her as seamstress has\\ndisappeared in a very unaccountable way from her master’s house\\nthe night before; in fact been abducted as she thinks from certain\\nevidences, through the window. Her manner is agitated, her appeal for\\nassistance urgent, though she acknowledges no relationship to the girl\\nor expresses any especial cause for her interest beyond that of common\\nhumanity. ‘She must be found,’ she declares, and hints that any sum\\nnecessary will be forthcoming, though from what source after her own\\npittance is expended she does not state. When asked if her master has\\nno interest in the matter, she changes color and puts us off. He never\\nnoticed his servants, left all such concerns to her, etc.; but shows\\nfear when a proposition is made to consult him. Next imagine yourself\\nwith the detectives in that gentleman’s house. You enter the girl’s\\nroom; what is the first thing you observe? Why that it is not only one\\nof the best in the house, but that it is conspicuous for its comforts if\\nnot for its elegancies. More than that, that there are books of poetry\\nand history lying around, showing that the woman who inhabited it was\\nabove her station; a fact which the housekeeper is presently brought to\\nacknowledge. You notice also that the wild surmise of her abduction by\\nmeans of the window, has some ground in appearance, though the fact\\nthat she went with entire unwillingness is not made so apparent. The\\nhousekeeper, however, insists in a way that must have had some special\\nknowledge of the girl’s character or circumstances to back it, that she\\nnever went without compulsion; a statement which the torn curtains\\nand the track of blood over the roof of the extension, would seem to\\nemphasize. A few other facts are made known. First, a pen-knife is\\npicked up from the grass plot in the yard beneath, showing with what\\ninstrument the wound was inflicted, whose drippings made those marks of\\nblood alluded to. It was a pearl-handled knife belonging to the writing\\ndesk found open on her table, and its frail and dainty character proved\\nindisputably, that it was employed by the girl herself, and that against\\nmanifest enemies; no man being likely to snatch up any such puny weapon\\nfor the purpose either of offence or defence. That these enemies were\\ntwo and were both men, was insisted upon by Mrs. Daniels who overheard\\ntheir voices the night before.\\n\\n“Mr. Blake, such facts as these arouse curiosity, especially when\\nthe master of the house being introduced upon the scene, he fails to\\nmanifest common human interest, while his housekeeper betrays in every\\ninvoluntary gesture and expression she makes use of, her horror if not\\nher fear of his presence, and her relief at his departure. Yes,” he\\nexclaimed, unheeding the sudden look here cast him by Mr. Blake, “and\\ncuriosity begets inquiry, and inquiry elucidated further facts such as\\nthese, that the mysterious master of the house was in his garden at the\\nhour of the girl’s departure, was even looking through the bars of his\\ngate when she, having evidently escaped from her captors, came back with\\nevery apparent desire to reenter her home, but seeing him, betrayed an\\nunreasonable amount of fear and fled back even into the very arms of\\nthe men she had endeavored to avoid. Did you speak sir?” asked Mr. Gryce\\nsuddenly stopping, with a sly look at his left boot tip.\\n\\nMr. Blake shook his head. “No,” said he shortly, “go on.” But that last\\nremark of Mr. Gryce had evidently made its impression.\\n\\n“Inquiry revealed, also, two or three other interesting facts. First,\\nthat this gentleman qualified though he was to shine in ladies’ society,\\nnever obtruded himself there, but employed his leisure time instead, in\\nwalking the lower streets of the city, where he was seen more than\\nonce conversing with certain poor girls at street corners and in blind\\nalleys. The last one he talked with, believed from her characteristics\\nto be the same one that was abducted from his house--”\\n\\n“Hold there,” said Mr. Blake with some authority in his tone, “there you\\nare mistaken; that is impossible.”\\n\\n“Ah, and why?”\\n\\n“The girl you allude to had bright golden hair, something which the\\nwoman who lived in my house did not possess.”\\n\\n“Indeed. I thought you had never noticed the woman who sewed for you,\\nsir,--did not know how she looked?”\\n\\n“I should have noticed her if she had had such hair as the girl you\\nspeak of.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce smiled and opened his pocketbook.\\n\\n“There is a sample of her hair, sir,” said he, taking out a thin strand\\nof brilliant hair and showing it to the gentleman before him. “Bright\\nyou see, and golden as that of the unfortunate creature you talked with\\nthe other night.”\\n\\nMr. Blake stooped forward and lifted it with a hand that visibly\\ntrembled. “Where did you get this?” asked he at last, clenching it to\\nhis breast with sudden passion.\\n\\n“From out of the comb which the girl had been using the night before.”\\n\\nThe imperious man flung it hastily from him.\\n\\n“We waste our time,” said he, looking Mr. Gryce intently in the face.\\n“All that you have said does not account for your presence here nor the\\ntone you have used while addressing me. What are you keeping back? I am\\nnot a man to be trifled with.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce rose to his feet. “You are right,” said he, and he gave a\\nshort glance in my direction. “All that I have said would not perhaps\\njustify me in this intrusion, if--” he looked again towards me. “Do you\\nwish me to continue?” he asked.\\n\\nMr. Blake’s intent look deepened. “I see no reason why you should not\\nutter the whole,” said he. “A good story loses nothing by being told\\nto the end. You wish to say something about my journey to Schoenmaker’s\\nhouse, I suppose.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce gravely shook his head.\\n\\n“What, you can let such a mystery as that go without a word?”\\n\\n“I am not here to discuss mysteries that have no connection with the\\nsewing-girl in whose cause I am interested.”\\n\\n“Then,” said Mr. Blake, turning for the first time upon my superior with\\nall the dignified composure for which he was eminent, “it is no\\nlonger necessary for us to prolong this interview. I have allowed, nay\\nencouraged you to state in the plainest terms what it was you had or\\nimagined you had against me, knowing that my actions of late, seen by\\nthose who did not possess the key to them, must have seemed a little\\npeculiar. But when you say you have no interest in any mystery\\ndisconnected with the girl who has lived the last few months in\\nmy house, I can with assurance say that it is time we quitted this\\nunprofitable conversation, as nothing which I have lately done, said or\\nthought here or elsewhere has in any way had even the remotest bearing\\nupon that individual; she having been a stranger to me while in my\\nhouse, and quite forgotten by me, after her unaccountable departure\\nhence.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce’s hand which had been stretched out towards the hitherto\\nuntouched decanter before him, suddenly dropped. “You deny then,” said\\nhe, “all connection between yourself and the woman, lady or sewing-girl,\\nwho occupied that room above our heads for eleven months previous to the\\nSunday morning I first had the honor to make your acquaintance.”\\n\\n“I am not in the habit of repeating my assertions,” said Mr. Blake with\\nsome severity, “even when they relate to a less disagreeable matter than\\nthe one under discussion.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce bowed, and slowly reached out for his hat; I had never seen\\nhim so disturbed. “I am sorry,” he began and stopped, fingering his\\nhat-brim nervously. Suddenly he laid his hat back, and drew up his form\\ninto as near a semblance of dignity as its portliness would allow.\\n\\n“Mr. Blake,” said he, “I have too much respect for the man I believed\\nyou to be when I entered this house to-night, to go with the thing\\nunsaid which is lying at present like a dead weight upon my lips. I dare\\nnot leave you to the consequence of my silence; for duty will compel\\nme to speak some day and in some presence where you may not have\\nthe opportunity which you can have here, to explain yourself with\\nsatisfaction. Mr. Blake I cannot believe you when you say the girl who\\nlived in this house was a stranger to you.”\\n\\nMr. Blake drew his proud form up in a disdain that was only held in\\ncheck by the very evident honesty of the man before him. “You\\nare courageous at least,” said he. “I regret you are not equally\\ndiscriminating.” And raising Mr. Gryce’s hat he placed it in his hand.\\n\\n“Pardon me,” said that gentleman, “I would like to justify myself before\\nI go. Not with words,” he proceeded as the other folded his arms with a\\nsarcastic bow. “I am done with words; action accomplishes the rest. Mr.\\nBlake I believe you consider me an honest officer and a reliable man.\\nWill you accompany me to your private room for a moment? There is\\nsomething there which may convince you I was neither playing the fool\\nnor the bravado when I uttered the phrase I did an instant ago.”\\n\\nI expected to hear the haughty master of the house refuse a request so\\npeculiar. But he only bowed, though in a surprised way that showed\\nhis curiosity if no more was aroused. “My room and company are at your\\ndisposal,” said he, “but you will find nothing there to justify you in\\nyour assertions.”\\n\\n“Let me at least make the effort,” entreated my superior.\\n\\nMr. Blake smiling bitterly immediately led the way to the door. “The\\nman may come,” he remarked carelessly as Mr. Gryce waved his hand in my\\ndirection. “Your justification if not mine may need witnesses.”\\n\\nRejoiced at the permission, for my curiosity was by this time raised to\\nfever pitch, I at once followed. Not without anxiety. The assured poise\\nof Mr. Blake’s head seemed to argue that the confidence betrayed by my\\nsuperior might receive a shock; and I felt it would be a serious blow\\nto his pride to fail now. But once within the room above, my doubts\\nspeedily fled. There was that in Mr. Gryce’s face which anyone\\nacquainted with him could not easily mistake. Whatever might be\\nthe mysterious something which the room contained, it was evidently\\nsufficient in his eyes to justify his whole conduct.\\n\\n“Now sir,” said Mr. Blake, turning upon my superior with his sternest\\nexpression, “the room and its contents are before you; what have you to\\nsay for yourself.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce equally stern, if not equally composed, cast one of his\\ninscrutable glances round the apartment and without a word stepped\\nbefore the picture that was as I have said, the only ornamentation of\\nthe otherwise bare and unattractive room.\\n\\nI thought Mr. Blake looked surprised, but his face was not one that\\nlightly expressed emotion.\\n\\n“A portrait of my cousin the Countess De Mirac,” said he with a certain\\ndryness of tone hard to interpret.\\n\\nMr. Gryce bowed and for a moment stood looking with a strange lack of\\ninterest at the proudly brilliant face of the painting before him, then\\nto our great amazement stepped forward and with a quick gesture turned\\nthe picture rapidly to the wall, when--Gracious heavens! what a vision\\nstarted out before us from the reverse side of that painted canvas! No\\nluxurious brunette countenance now, steeped in pride and languor, but a\\nface--Let me see if I can describe it. But no, it was one of those faces\\nthat are indescribable. You draw your breath as you view it; you feel as\\nif you had had an electric shock; but as for knowing ten minutes later\\nwhether the eyes that so enthralled you were blue or black, or the locks\\nthat clustered halo-like about a forehead almost awful in its expression\\nof weird, unfathomable power, were brown or red, you could not nor would\\nyou pretend to say. It was the character of the countenance itself that\\nimpressed you. You did not even know if this woman who might have been\\nanything wonderful or grand you ever read of, were beautiful or not. You\\ndid not care; it was as if you had been gazing on a tranquil evening\\nsky and a lightning flash had suddenly startled you. Is the lightning\\nbeautiful? Who asks! But I know from what presently transpired, that\\nthe face was ivory pale in complexion, the eyes deeply dark, and the\\nhair,--strange and uncanny combination,--of a bright and peculiar golden\\nhue.\\n\\n“You dare!” came forth in strange broken tones from Mr. Blake’s lips.\\n\\nI instantly turned towards him. He was gazing with a look that was half\\nindignant, half menacing at the silent detective who with eyes drooped\\nand finger directed towards the picture, seemed to be waiting for him to\\nfinish.\\n\\n“I do not understand an audacity that allows you to--to--” Was this\\nthe haughty gentleman we had known, this hesitating troubled man with\\nbloodless lips and trembling hands?\\n\\n“I declared my desire to justify myself,” said my principal with a\\nrespectful bow. “This is my justification. Do you note the color of the\\nwoman’s hair whose portrait hangs with its face turned to the wall in\\nyour room? Is it like or unlike that of the strand you held in your hand\\na few moments ago; a strand taken as I swear, hair by hair from the comb\\nof the poor creature who occupied the room above. But that is not all,”\\n he continued as Mr. Blake fell a trifle aback; “just observe the dress\\nin which this woman is painted; blue silk you see, dark and rich; a wide\\ncollar cunningly executed, you can almost trace the pattern; a brooch;\\nthen the roses in the hand, do you see? Now come with me upstairs.”\\n\\nToo much startled to speak, Mr. Blake, haughty aristocrat as he was,\\nturned like a little child and followed the detective who with an\\nassured step and unembarassed mien led the way into the deserted room\\nabove.\\n\\n“You accuse me of insulting you, when I express disbelief of your\\nassertion that there was no connection between you and the girl Emily,”\\n said Mr. Gryce as he lit the gas and unlocked that famous bureau drawer.\\n“Will you do so any longer in face of these?” And drawing off the towel\\nthat lay uppermost, he revealed the neatly folded dress, wide collar,\\nbrooch and faded roses that lay beneath. “Mrs. Daniels assures us these\\narticles belonged to the sewing-woman Emily; were brought here by her.\\nDare you say they are not the ones reproduced in the portrait below?”\\n\\nMr. Blake uttering a cry sank on his knees before the drawer. “My God!\\nMy God!” was his only reply, “what are these?” Suddenly he rose, his\\nwhole form quivering, his eyes burning. “Where is Mrs. Daniels?” he\\ncried, hastily advancing and pulling the bell. “I must see her at once.\\nSend the house-keeper here,” he ordered as Fanny smiling demurely made\\nher appearance at the door.\\n\\n“Mrs. Daniels is out,” returned the girl, “went out as soon as ever you\\ngot up from dinner, sir.”\\n\\n“Gone out at this hour?”\\n\\n“Yes sir; she goes out very often nowadays, sir.”\\n\\nHer master frowned. “Send her to me as soon as she returns,” he\\ncommanded, and dismissed the girl.\\n\\n“I don’t know what to make of this,” he now said in a strange tone,\\napproaching again the touching contents of that open bureau drawer with\\na look in which longing and doubt seemed in some way to be strangely\\ncommingled. “I cannot explain the presence of these articles in this\\nroom; but if you will come below I will see what I can do to make other\\nmatters intelligible to you. Disagreeable as it is for me to take anyone\\ninto my confidence, affairs have gone too far for me to hope any longer\\nto preserve secrecy as to my private concerns.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI. LUTTRA\\n\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” said he as he ushered us once more into his studio, “you\\nhave presumed, and not without reason I should say, to infer that the\\noriginal of this portrait and the woman who has so long occupied the\\nposition of sewing-woman in my house, are one and the same. You will no\\nlonger retain that opinion when I inform you that this picture, strange\\nas it may appear to you, is the likeness of my wife.”\\n\\n“Wife!” We both were astonished as I take it, but it was my voice which\\nspoke. “We were ignorant you ever had a wife.”\\n\\n“No doubt,” continued our host smiling bitterly, “that at least has\\nevaded the knowledge even of the detectives.” Then with a return to\\nhis naturally courteous manner, “She was never acknowledged by me as my\\nwife, nor have we ever lived together, but if priestly benediction can\\nmake a man and woman one, that woman as you see her there is my lawful\\nwife.”\\n\\nRising, he softly turned the lovely, potent face back to the wall,\\nleaving us once more confronted by the dark and glowing countenance of\\nhis cousin.\\n\\n“I am not called upon,” said he, “to go any further with you than this.\\nI have told you what no man till this hour has ever heard from my lips,\\nand it should serve to exonerate me from any unjust suspicions you may\\nhave entertained. But to one of my temperament, secret scandal and the\\ngossip it engenders is only less painful than open notoriety. If I leave\\nthe subject here, a thousand conjectures will at once seize upon you,\\nand my name if not hers will become, before I know it, the football of\\ngossip if not of worse and deeper suspicion than has yet assailed me.\\nGentleman I take you to be honest men; husbands, perhaps, and fathers;\\nproud, too, in your way and jealous of your own reputation and that of\\nthose with whom you are connected. If I succeed in convincing you that\\nmy movements of late have been totally disconnected with the girl whose\\ncause you profess solely to be interested in, may I count upon your\\nsilence as regards those actions and the real motive that led to them?”\\n\\n“You may count upon my discretion as regards all matters that do not\\ncome under the scope of police duty,” returned Mr. Gryce. “I haven’t\\nmuch time for gossip.”\\n\\n“And your man here?”\\n\\n“O, he’s safe where it profits him to be.”\\n\\n“Very well, then, I shall count upon you.”\\n\\nAnd with the knitted brows and clinched hands of a proudly reticent\\nman who, perhaps for the first time in his life finds himself forced to\\nreveal his inner nature to the world, he began his story in these words:\\n\\n“Difficult as it is for me to introduce into a relation like this the\\nname of my father, I shall be obliged to do so in order to make my\\nconduct at a momentous crisis of my life intelligible to you. My father,\\nthen, was a man of strong will and a few but determined prejudices.\\nResolved that I should sustain the reputation of the family for wealth\\nand respectability, he gave me to understand from my earliest years,\\nthat as long as I preserved my manhood from reproach, I had only to make\\nmy wishes known, to have them immediately gratified; while if I crossed\\nhis will either by indulging in dissipation or engaging in pursuits\\nunworthy of my name, I no longer need expect the favor of his\\ncountenance or the assistance of his purse.\\n\\n“When, therefore, at a certain period of my life, I found that the\\ncharms of my cousin Evelyn were making rather too strong an impression\\nupon my fancy for a secured peace of mind, I first inquired how such a\\nunion would affect my father, and learning that it would be in direct\\nopposition to his views, cast about in my mind what I should do to\\novercome my passion. Travel suggested itself, and I took a trip to\\nEurope. But the sight of new faces only awakened in me comparisons\\nanything but detrimental to the beauty of her who was at that time my\\nstandard of feminine loveliness. Nature and the sports connected with a\\nwild life were my next resort. I went overland to California, roamed the\\norange groves of Florida, and probed the wildernesses of Canada and\\nour Northern states. It was during these last excursions that an event\\noccurred which has exercised the most material influence upon my fate,\\nthough at the time it seemed to me no more than the matter of a day.\\n\\n“I had just returned from Canada and was resting in tolerable enjoyment\\nof a very beautiful autumn at Lake George, when a letter reached me\\nfrom a friend then loitering in the vicinity, urging me to join him in\\na certain small town in Vermont where trout streams abounded and what is\\nnot so often the case under the circumstances, fishers were few.\\n\\n“Being in a somewhat reckless mood I at once wrote a consent, and before\\nanother day was over, started for the remote village whence his letter\\nwas postmarked. I found it by no means easy of access. Situated in the\\nmidst of hills some twenty miles or so distant from any railroad, I\\ndiscovered that in order to reach it, a long ride in a stage-coach was\\nnecessary, followed by a somewhat shorter journey on horseback. Not\\nbeing acquainted with the route, I timed my connections wrong, so that\\nwhen evening came I found myself riding over a strange road in the\\ndarkest night I had ever known. As if this was not enough, my horse\\nsuddenly began to limp and presently became so lame I found it\\nimpossible to urge her beyond a slow walk. It was therefore with no\\nordinary satisfaction that I presently beheld a lighted building in the\\ndistance, which as I approached resolved itself into an inn. Stopping\\nin front of the house, which was closed against the chill night air,\\nI called out lustily for someone to take my horse, whereupon the door\\nopened and a man appeared on the threshold with a lantern in his hand. I\\nat once made my wishes known, receiving in turn a somewhat gruff,\\n\\n“‘Well it is a nasty night and it will be nastier before it’s over;’ an\\nopinion instantly endorsed by a sudden swoop of wind that rushed by at\\nthat moment, slamming the door behind him and awakening over my head a\\nlugubrious groaning as from the twisting boughs of some old tree, that\\nwas almost threatening in its character.\\n\\n“‘You had better go in,’ said he, ‘the rain will come next.’\\n\\n“I at once leaped from my horse and pushing open the door with main\\nstrength, entered the house. Another man met me on the threshold who\\nmerely pointing over his shoulder to a lighted room in his rear, passed\\nout without a word, to help the somewhat younger man, who had first\\nappeared, in putting up my horse. I at once accepted his silent\\ninvitation and stepped into the room before me. Instantly I found myself\\nconfronted by the rather startling vision of a young girl of a unique\\nand haunting style of beauty, who rising at my approach now stood with\\nher eyes on my face and her hands resting on the deal table before which\\nshe had been sitting, in an attitude expressive of mingled surprise\\nand alarm. To see a woman in that place was not so strange; but such\\na woman! Even in the first casual glance I gave her, I at once\\nacknowledged to myself her extraordinary power. Not the slightness of\\nher form, the palor of her countenance, or the fairness of the locks of\\ngolden red hair that fell in two long braids over her bosom, could for\\na moment counteract the effect of her dark glance or the vivid almost\\nunearthly force of her expression. It was as if you saw a flame\\nupstarting before you, waving tremulously here and there, but burning\\nand resistless in its white heat. I took off my hat with deference.\\n\\n“A shudder passed over her, but she made no effort to return my\\nacknowledgement. As we cast our eyes dilating with horror, down some\\nhorrible pit upon whose verge we suddenly find ourselves, she allowed\\nher gaze for a moment to dwell upon my face, then with a sudden lifting\\nof her hand, pointed towards the door as if to bid me depart--when it\\nswung open with that shrill rushing of wind that involuntarily awakes a\\nshudder within you, and the two men entered and came stamping up to my\\nside. Instantly her hand sunk, not feebly as with fear, but calmly as if\\nat the bidding of her will, and without waiting for them to speak, she\\nturned away and quietly left the room. As the door closed upon her I\\nnoticed that she wore a calico frock and that her face did not own one\\nperfect feature.\\n\\n“‘Go after Luttra and tell her to make up the bed in the northwest\\nroom,’ said the elder of the two in deep gutteral tones unmistakably\\nGerman in their accent, to the other who stood shaking the wet off his\\ncoat into the leaping flames of a small wood fire that burned on the\\nhearth before us.\\n\\n“‘O, she’ll do without my bothering,’ was the sullen return. ‘I’m wet\\nthrough.’\\n\\n“The elder man, a large powerfully framed fellow of some fifty years or\\nso, frowned. It was an evil frown, and the younger one seemed to feel\\nit. He immediately tossed his coat onto a chair and left the room.\\n\\n“‘Boys are so obstropolous now-a-days,’ remarked his companion to me\\nwith what he evidently intended for a conciliatory nod. ‘In my time they\\nwere broke in, did what they were told and asked no questions.’\\n\\n“I smiled to myself at his calling the broad shouldered six-footer who\\nhad just left us a boy, but merely remarking, ‘He is your son is he\\nnot!’ seated myself before the blaze which shot up a tongue of white\\nflame at my approach, that irresistibly recalled to my fancy the\\nappearance of the girl who had gone out a moment before.\\n\\n“‘O, yes, he is my son, and that girl you saw here was my daughter; I\\nkeep this inn and they help me, but it is a slow way to live, I can tell\\nyou. Travel on these roads is slim.’\\n\\n“‘I should think likely,’ I returned, remembering the half dozen or so\\nhills up which I had clambered since I took to my horse. ‘How far are we\\nfrom Pentonville?’\\n\\n“‘O, two or three miles,’ he replied, but in a hurried kind of a way.\\n‘Not far in the daytime but a regular journey in a night like this?’\\n\\n“‘Yes,’ said I, as the house shook under a fresh gust; ‘it is fortunate\\nI have a place in which to put up.’\\n\\n“He glanced down at my baggage which consisted of a small hand bag,\\nan over-coat and a fishing pole, with something like a gleam of\\ndisappointment.\\n\\n“‘Going fishing?’ he asked.\\n\\n“‘Yes,’ I returned.\\n\\n“‘Good trout up those streams and plenty of them,’ he went on. ‘Going\\nalone?’\\n\\n“I did not half like his importunity, but considering I had nothing\\nbetter to do, replied as affably as possible. ‘No, I expect to meet a\\nfriend in Pentonville who will accompany me.”\\n\\n“His hand went to his beard in a thoughtful attitude and he cast me\\nwhat, with my increased experience of the world, I should now consider a\\nsinister glance. ‘Then you are expected?’ said he.\\n\\n“Not considering this worth reply, I stretched out my feet to the blaze\\nand began to warm them, for I felt chilled through.\\n\\n“‘Been on the road long?’ he now asked, glancing at the blue flannel\\nsuit I wore.\\n\\n“‘All summer,’ I returned,\\n\\n“I again thought he looked disappointed.\\n\\n“‘From Troy or New York?’ he went on with a vague endeavor to appear\\ngood naturally off hand.\\n\\n“‘New York.’\\n\\n“‘A big place that,’ he continued. ‘I was there once, lots of money\\nstored away in them big buildings down in Wall Street, eh?’\\n\\n“I assented, and he drew a chair up to my side, a proceeding that was\\ninterrupted, however, by the reentrance of his son, who without any\\napology crowded into the other side of the fire-place in a way to\\nsandwich me between them. Not fancying this arrangement which I,\\nhowever, imputed to ignorance, I drew back and asked if my room was\\nready. It seemed it was not, and unpleasantly as it promised, I felt\\nforced to reseat myself and join in, if not support, the conversation\\nthat followed.\\n\\n“A half hour passed away, during which the wind increased till it almost\\namounted to a gale. Spurts of rain dashed against the windows with a\\nsharp crackling sound that suggested hail, while ever and anon a distant\\nroll as of rousing thunder, rumbled away among the hills in a long and\\nreverberating peal, that made me feel glad to be housed even under the\\nroof of these rude and uncongenial creatures. Suddenly the conversation\\nturned upon the time and time-pieces, when in a low even tone I heard\\nmurmured behind me,\\n\\n“‘The gentleman’s room is ready;’ and turning, I saw standing in\\nthe doorway the slight figure of the young girl whose appearance had\\npreviously so impressed me.\\n\\n“I immediately arose. ‘Then I will proceed to it at once,’ said I,\\ntaking up my traps and advancing towards her.\\n\\n“‘Do not be alarmed if you hear creaks and cracklings all over the\\nhouse,’ observed the landlord as I departed. ‘The windows are loose and\\nthe doors ill-fitting. In such a storm as this they make noise enough\\nto keep an army awake. The house is safe enough though and if you don’t\\nmind noise--’\\n\\n“‘O I don’t mind noise,’ rejoined I, feeling at that moment tired enough\\nto fall into a doze on the staircase. ‘I shall sleep, never fear,’ and\\nwithout further ado followed the girl upstairs into a large clumsily\\nfurnished room whose enormous bed draped with heavy curtains at once\\nattracted my attention.\\n\\n“‘O I cannot sleep under those things,’ remarked I, with a gesture\\ntowards the dismal draperies which to me were another name for\\nsuffocation.\\n\\n“With a single arm-sweep she threw them back. ‘Is there anything more I\\ncan do for you?’ asked she, glancing hastily about the room.\\n\\n“I thanked her and said ‘no,’ at which she at once departed with a look\\nof still determination upon her countenance that I found it hard to\\nexplain.\\n\\n“Left alone in that large, bare and dimly lighted room, with the wind\\nshrieking in the chimney and the powerful limbs of some huge tree\\nbeating against the walls without, with a heavy thud inexpressibly\\nmournful, I found to my surprise and something like dismay, that the\\nsleepiness which had hitherto oppressed me, had in some unaccountable\\nway entirely fled. In vain I contemplated the bed, comfortable enough\\nnow in its appearance that the stifling curtains were withdrawn; no\\ntemptation to invade it came to arouse me from the chair into which I\\nhad thrown myself. It was as if I felt myself under the spell of some\\ninvisible influence that like the eye of a basilisk, held me enchained.\\nI remember turning my head towards a certain quarter of the wall as if\\nI half expected to encounter there the bewildering glance of a serpent.\\nYet far from being apprehensive of any danger, I only wondered over the\\nweakness of mind that made such fancies possible.\\n\\n“An extra loud swirl of the foliage without, accompanied by a quick\\nvibration of the house, aroused me at last. If I was to lose the sense\\nof this furious storm careering over my head, I must court sleep at\\nonce. Rising, I drew off my coat, unloosened my vest and was about to\\nthrow it off, when I bethought me of a certain wallet it contained.\\nGoing to the door in some unconscious impulse of precaution I suppose, I\\nlocked myself in, and then drawing out my wallet, took from it a roll of\\nbills which I put into a small side pocket, returning the wallet to its\\nold place.\\n\\n“Why I did this I can scarcely say. As I have before intimated, I\\nwas under no special apprehension. I was at that time anything but a\\nsuspicious man, and the manner and appearance of the men below struck me\\nas unpleasantly disagreeable but nothing more. But I not only did what I\\nhave related, but allowed the lamp to remain lighted, lying down finally\\nin my clothes; an almost unprecedented act on my part, warranted however\\nas I said to myself, by the fury of the gale which at that time seemed\\nas if it would tumble the roof over our heads.\\n\\n“How long I lay listening to the creakings and groanings of the rickety\\nold house, I cannot say, nor how long I remained in the doze which\\nfinally seized me as I became accustomed to the sounds around and over\\nme. Enough that before the storm had passed its height, I awoke as if at\\nthe touch of a hand, and leaping with a bound out of the bed, beheld\\nto my incredible amazement, the alert, nervous form of Luttra standing\\nbefore me. She had my coat in her hand, and it was her touch that had\\nevidently awakened me.\\n\\n“‘I want you to put this on,’ said she in a low thrilling tone totally\\nnew in my experience, ‘and come with me. The house is unsafe for you to\\nremain in. Hear how it cracks and trembles. Another blast like that and\\nwe shall be roofless.’\\n\\n“She was moving toward the door, which to my amazement stood ajar, but\\nmy hesitation stopped her.\\n\\n“‘Won’t you come?’ she whispered, turning her face towards me with a\\nlook of such potent determination, I followed in spite of myself ‘I dare\\nnot let you stay here, your blood will be upon my head.’\\n\\n“‘You exaggerate,’ I replied, shrinking back with a longing look at the\\ncomfortable bed I had just left. ‘These old houses are always strong.\\nIt will take many such a gust as that you hear, to overturn it, I assure\\nyou.’\\n\\n“‘I exaggerate!’ she returned with a look of scorn impossible to\\ndescribe. ‘Hark!’ she said, ‘hear that.’\\n\\n“I did hear, and I must acknowledge that it seemed is if we were about\\nto be swept from our foundations.\\n\\n“‘Yes,’ said I, ‘but it is a fearful night to be out in.’\\n\\n“‘I shall go with you,’ said she.\\n\\n“‘In that case--’ I began with an ill-advised attempt at gallantry which\\nshe cut short with a gesture.\\n\\n“‘Here is your hat,’ remarked she, ‘and here is your bag. The\\nfishing-pole must remain, you cannot carry it.’\\n\\n“‘But,--’ I expostulated.\\n\\n“‘Hush!’ said she with her ear turned towards the depths of the\\nstaircase at the top of which we stood. ‘My father and brother will\\nthink as you do that it is folly to leave the shelter of a roof for the\\nuncertainties of the road on such a night as this, but you must not heed\\nthem. I tell you shelter this night is danger, and that the only safety\\nto be found is on the stormy highway.’\\n\\n“And without waiting for my reply, she passed rapidly down stairs,\\npushed open a door at the bottom, and stepped at once into the room we\\nhad left an hour or so before.\\n\\n“What was there in that room that for the first time struck an ominous\\nchill as of distinct peril through my veins? Nothing at first sight,\\neverything at the second. The fire which had not been allowed to die\\nout, still burned brightly on the ruddy hearthstone, but it was not that\\nwhich awakened my apprehension. Nor was it the loud ticking clock on the\\nmantel-piece with its hand pointing silently to the hour of eleven. Nor\\nyet the heavy quiet of the scantily-furnished room with its one lamp\\nburning on the deal table against the side of the wall. It was the sight\\nof those two powerful men drawn up in grim silence, the one against the\\ndoor leading to the front hall, the other against that opening into the\\nkitchen.\\n\\n“A glance at Luttra standing silent and undismayed at my side, however,\\ninstantly reassured me. With that will exercised in my favor, I could\\nnot but win through whatever it was that menaced me. Slinging my bag\\nover my shoulder, I made a move towards the door and the silent figure\\nof my host. But with a quick outreaching of her hand, she drew me back.\\n\\n“‘Stand still!’ said she. ‘Karl,’ she went on, turning her face towards\\nthe more sullen but less intent countenance of her brother, ‘open the\\ndoor and let this gentleman pass. He finds the house unsafe in such a\\ngale and desires to leave it. At once!’ she continued as her brother\\nsettled himself more determinedly against the lock: ‘I don’t often ask\\nfavors.’\\n\\n“‘The man is a fool that wants to go out in a night like this,’ quoth\\nthe fellow with a dogged move; ‘and so are you to encourage it. I think\\ntoo much of your health to allow it.’\\n\\n“She did not seem to hear. ‘Will you open the door?’ she went on, not\\nadvancing a step from the fire, before which she had placed herself and\\nme.’\\n\\n“‘No, I won’t,’ was the brutal reply. ‘Its been locked for the night and\\nits not me nor one like me, that will open it.’\\n\\n“With a sudden whitening of her already pale face, she turned towards\\nher father. He was not even looking at her.\\n\\n“‘Some one must open the house,’ said she, glancing back at her brother.\\n‘This gentleman purposes to leave and his whim must be humored. Will you\\nunlock that door or shall I?’\\n\\n“An angry snarl interrupted her. Her father had bounded from the door\\nwhere he stood and was striding hastily towards her. In my apprehension\\nI put up my arm for a shield, for he looked ready to murder her, but\\nI let it drop again as l caught her glance which was like white flame\\nundisturbed by the least breeze of personal terror.\\n\\n“‘You will stop there,’ said she, pointing to a spot a few feet from\\nwhere she stood. ‘Another step and I let that for which I have heard\\nyou declare you would peril your very soul, fall into the heart of the\\nflames.’ And drawing from her breast a roll of bills, she stretched them\\nout above the fire before which she was standing.\\n\\n“‘You -----’ broke from the gray-bearded lips of the old man, but he\\nstopped where he was, eyeing those bills as if fascinated.\\n\\n“‘I am not a girl of many words, as you know,’ continued she in a lofty\\ntone inexpressibly commanding. ‘You may strangle me, you may kill me,\\nit matters little; but this gentleman leaves the house this night, or I\\ndestroy the money with a gesture.’\\n\\n“‘You -----’ again broke from those quivering lips, but the old man did\\nnot move.\\n\\n“Not so the younger. With a rush he left his post and in another instant\\nwould have had his powerful arms about her slender form, only that I\\nmet him half way with a blow that laid him on the floor at her feet.\\nShe said nothing, but one of the bills immediately left her hand and\\nfluttered into the fire where it instantly shrivelled into nothing.\\n\\n“With the yell of a mad beast wounded in his most vulnerable spot, the\\nold man before us stamped with his heel upon the floor.\\n\\n“‘Stop!’ cried he; and going rapidly to the front door he opened it.\\n‘There!’ shrieked he, ‘if you will be fools, go! and may the lightning\\nblast you. But first give me the money.’\\n\\n“‘Come from the door,’ said she, reaching out her left hand for the\\nlantern hanging at the side of the fireplace, ‘and let Karl light this\\nand keep himself out of the way.’\\n\\n“It was all done. In less time than I can tell it, the old man had\\nstepped from the door, the younger one had lit the lantern and we were\\nin readiness to depart.\\n\\n“‘Now do you proceed,’ said she to me, ‘I will follow.’\\n\\n“‘No,’ said I, ‘we will go together.’\\n\\n“‘But the money?’ growled the heavy voice of my host over my shoulder.\\n\\n“‘I will give it to you on my return,’ said the girl.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII. A WOMAN’S LOVE\\n\\n\\n“Shall I ever forget the blast of driving rain that struck our faces and\\nenveloped us in a cloud of wet, as the door swung on its hinges and let\\nus forth into the night; or the electric thrill that shot through me as\\nthat slender girl grasped my hand and drew me away through the blinding\\ndarkness. It was not that I was so much affected by her beauty as\\ninfluenced by her power and energy. The fury of the gale seemed to bend\\nto her will, the wind lend wings to her feet. I began to realize what\\nintellect was. Arrived at the roadside, she paused and looked back. The\\ntwo burly forms of the men we had left behind us were standing in the\\ndoor of the inn; in another moment they had plunged forth and towards\\nus. With a low cry the young girl leaped towards a tree where to\\nmy unbounded astonishment I beheld my horse standing ready saddled.\\nDragging the mare from her fastenings, she hung the lantern, burning as\\nit was, on the pommel of the saddle, struck the panting creature a smart\\nblow upon the flank, and drew back with a leap to my side.\\n\\n“The startled horse snorted, gave a plunge of dismay and started away\\nfrom us down the road.\\n\\n“‘We will wait,’ said Luttra.\\n\\n“The words were no sooner out of her mouth than her father and brother\\nrushed by.\\n\\n“‘They will follow the light,’ whispered she; and seizing me again by\\nthe hand, she hurried me away in the direction opposite to that\\nwhich the horse had taken. ‘If you will trust me, I will bring you to\\nshelter,’ she murmured, bending her slight form to the gusty wind but\\nrelaxing not a whit of her speed.\\n\\n“‘You are too kind,’ I murmured in return. ‘Why should you expose\\nyourself to such an extent for a stranger?’\\n\\n“Her hand tightened on mine, but she did not reply, and we hastened\\non as speedily as the wind and rain would allow. After a short but\\ndetermined breasting of the storm, during which my breath had nearly\\nfailed me, she suddenly stopped.\\n\\n“‘Do you know,’ she exclaimed in a low impressive tone, ‘that we are on\\nthe verge of a steep and dreadful precipice? It runs along here for a\\nquarter of a mile and it is not an uncommon thing for a horse and rider\\nto be dashed over it in a night like this.’\\n\\n“There was something in her manner that awakened a chill in my veins\\nalmost as if she had pointed out some dreadful doom which I had\\nunwittingly escaped.\\n\\n“‘This is, then, a dangerous road,’ I murmured.\\n\\n“‘Very,’ was her hurried and almost incoherent reply.\\n\\n“How far we travelled through the mud and tangled grasses of that\\nhorrible road I do not know. It seemed a long distance; it was probably\\nnot more than three quarters of a mile. At last she paused with a short\\n‘Here we are;’ and looking up, I saw that we were in front of a small\\nunlighted cottage.\\n\\n“No refuge ever appeared more welcome to a pair of sinking wanderers I\\nam sure. Wet to the skin, bedrabbled with mud, exhausted with breasting\\nthe gale, we stood for a moment under the porch to regain our breath,\\nthen with her characteristic energy she lifted the knocker and struck a\\nsmart blow on the door.\\n\\n“‘We will find shelter here,’ said she.\\n\\n“She was not mistaken. In a few moments we were standing once more\\nbefore a comfortable fire hastily built by the worthy couple whose\\nslumbers we had thus interrupted. As I began to realize the sweetness of\\nconscious safety, all that this young, heroic creature had done for me\\nswept warmly across my mind. Looking up from the fire that was beginning\\nto infuse its heat through my grateful system, I surveyed her as she\\nslowly undid her long braids and shook them dry over the blaze, and\\nalmost started to see how young she was. Not more than sixteen I should\\nsay, and yet what an invincible will shone from her dark eyes and\\ndignified her slender form; a will gentle as it was strong, elevated\\nas it was unbending. I bowed my head as I watched her, in grateful\\nthankfulness which I presently put into words.\\n\\n“At once she drew herself erect. ‘I did but my duty,’ said she quietly.\\n‘I am glad I was prospered in it.’ Then slowly. ‘If you are grateful,\\nsir, will you promise to say nothing of--of what took place at the inn?’\\n\\n“Instantly I remembered a suspicion which had crossed my mind while\\nthere, and my hand went involuntarily to my vest pocket. The roll of\\nbills was gone.\\n\\n“She did not falter. ‘I would be relieved if you would,’ continued she.\\n\\n“I drew out my empty hand, looked at it, but said nothing.\\n\\n“‘Have you lost anything?’ asked she. ‘Search in your overcoat pockets.’\\n\\n“I plunged my hand into the one nearest her and drew it out with\\nsatisfaction; the roll of bills was there. ‘I give you my promise,’ said\\nI.\\n\\n“‘You will find a bill missing,’ she murmured; ‘for what amount I do not\\nknow; the sacrifice of something was inevitable.’\\n\\n“‘I can only wonder over the ingenuity you displayed, as well as express\\nmy appreciation for your bravery,’ returned I with enthusiasm. ‘You are\\na noble girl.’\\n\\n“She put out her hand as if compliments hurt her. ‘It is the first time\\nthey have ever attempted anything like that,’ cried she in a quick low\\ntone full of shame and suffering. ‘They have shown a disposition to--to\\ntake money sometimes, but they never threatened life before. And they\\ndid threaten yours. They saw you take out your money, through a hole\\npierced in the wall of the room you occupied, and the sight made them\\nmad. They were going to kill you and then tumble you and your horse over\\nthe precipice below there. But I overheard them talking and when they\\nwent out to saddle the horse, I hurried up to your room to wake you. I\\nhad to take possession of the bills; you were not safe while you held\\nthem. I took them quietly because I hoped to save you without betraying\\nthem. But I failed in that. You must remember they are my father and my\\nbrother.’\\n\\n“‘I will not betray them,’ said I.\\n\\n“She smiled. It was a wintry gleam but it ineffably softened her face. I\\nbecame conscious of a movement of pity towards her.\\n\\n“‘You have a hard lot,’ remarked I. ‘Your life must be a sad one.’\\n\\n“She flashed upon me one glance of her dark eye. ‘I was born for\\nhardship,’ said she, ‘but--’ and a sudden wild shudder seized her, ‘but\\nnot for crime.’\\n\\n“The word fell like a drop of blood wrung from her heart.\\n\\n“‘Good heavens!’ cried I, ‘and must you--’\\n\\n“‘No,’ rang from her lips in a clarion-like peal; ‘some things cut the\\nvery bonds of nature. I am not called upon to cleave to what will drag\\nme into infamy.’ Then calmly, as if speaking of the most ordinary matter\\nin the world, ‘I shall never go back to that house we have left behind\\nus, sir.’\\n\\n“‘But,’ cried I, glancing at her scanty garments, ‘where will you go?\\nWhat will you do? You are young--’\\n\\n“‘And very strong,’ she interrupted. ‘Do not fear for me.’ And her smile\\nwas like a burst of sudden sunshine.\\n\\n“I said no more that night.\\n\\n“But when in the morning I stumbled upon her sitting in the kitchen\\nreading a book not only above her position but beyond her years,\\na sudden impulse seized me and I asked her if she would like to be\\neducated. The instantaneous illumining of her whole face was sufficient\\nreply without her low emphatic words,\\n\\n“‘I would be content to study on my knees to know what some women do,\\nwhom I have seen.’\\n\\n“It is not necessary for me to relate with what pleasure I caught at\\nthe idea that here was a chance to repay in some slight measure the\\ninestimable favor she had done me; nor by what arguments I finally won\\nher to accept an education at my hands as some sort of recompense for\\nthe life she had saved. The advantage which it would give her in her\\nstruggle with the world she seemed duly to appreciate, but that so\\ngreat a favor could be shown her without causing me much trouble and an\\nunwarrantable expense, she could not at once be brought to comprehend,\\nand till she could, she held out with that gentle but inflexible will of\\nhers. The battle, however, was won at last and I left her in that little\\ncottage, with the understanding that as soon as the matter could be\\narranged, she was to enter a certain boarding-school in Troy with the\\nmistress of which I was acquainted. Meanwhile she was to go out to\\nservice at Melville and earn enough money to provide herself with\\nclothes.\\n\\n“I was a careless fellow in those days but I kept my promise to that\\ngirl. I not only entered her into that school for a course of three\\nyears, but acting through its mistress who had taken a great fancy to\\nher, supplied her with the necessities her position required. It was so\\neasy; merely the signing of a check from time to time, and it was\\ndone. I say this because I really think if it had involved any personal\\nsacrifice on my part, even of an hour of my time, or the labor of a\\nthought, I should not have done it. For with my return to the city my\\ninterest in my cousin revived, absorbing me to such an extent that any\\nmatter disconnected with her soon lost all charm for me.\\n\\n“Two years passed; I was the slave of Evelyn Blake, but there was no\\nengagement between us. My father’s determined opposition was enough to\\nprevent that. But there was an understanding which I fondly hoped would\\none day open for me the way of happiness. But I did not know my father.\\nSick as he was--he was at that time laboring under the disease which in\\na couple of months later bore him to the tomb--he kept an eye upon my\\nmovements and seemed to probe my inmost heart. At last he came to a\\ndefinite decision and spoke.\\n\\n“His words opened a world of dismay before me. I was his only child, as\\nhe remarked, and it had been and was the desire of his heart to leave\\nme as rich and independent a man as himself. But I seemed disposed\\nto commit one of those acts against which he had the most determined\\nprejudice; marriage between cousins being in his eyes an unsanctified\\nand dangerous proceeding, liable to consequences the most unhappy. If I\\npersisted, he must will his property elsewhere. The Blake estate should\\nnever descend with the seal of his approbation to a race of probable\\nimbeciles.\\n\\n“Nor was this enough. He not only robbed me of the woman I loved,\\nbut with a clear insight into the future, I presume, insisted upon\\nmy marrying some one else of respectability and worth before he died.\\n‘Anyone whose appearance will do you credit and whose virtue is beyond\\nreproach,’ said he. ‘I don’t ask her to be rich or even the offspring of\\none of our old families. Let her be good and pure and of no connection\\nto us, and I will bless her and you with my dying breath.’\\n\\n“The idea had seized upon him with great force, and I soon saw he was\\nnot to be shaken out of it. To all my objections he returned but the one\\nword,\\n\\n“‘I don’t restrict your choice and I give you a month in which to\\nmake it. If at the end of that time you cannot bring your bride to my\\nbedside, I must look around for an heir who will not thwart my dying\\nwishes.’”\\n\\n“A month! I surveyed the fashionable belles that nightly thronged the\\nparlors of my friends and felt my heart sink within me. Take one of them\\nfor my wife, loving another woman? Impossible. Women like these demanded\\nsomething in return for the honor they conferred upon a man by marrying\\nhim. Wealth? they had it. Position? that was theirs also. Consideration?\\nah, what consideration had I to give? I turned from them with distaste.\\n\\n“My cousin Evelyn gave me no help. She was a proud woman and loved my\\nmoney and my expectations as much as she did me.\\n\\n“‘If you must marry another woman to retain your wealth, marry, said\\nshe, ‘but do not marry one of my associates. I will have no rival in my\\nown empire; your wife must be a plainer and a less aspiring woman than\\nEvelyn Blake. Yet do not discredit your name,--which is mine,’ she would\\nalways add.\\n\\n“Meanwhile the days flew by. If my own conscience had allowed me to\\nforget the fact, my father’s eagerly inquiring, but sternly unrelenting\\ngaze as I came each evening to his bedside, would have kept it\\nsufficiently in my mind. I began to feel like one in the power of\\nsome huge crushing machine whose slowly descending weight he in vain\\nendeavors to escape.\\n\\n“How or when the thought of Luttra first crossed my mind I cannot\\nsay. At first I recoiled at the suggestion and put it away from me in\\ndisdain; but it ever recurred and with it so many arguments in her favor\\nthat before long I found myself regarding it as a refuge. To be sure she\\nwas a waif and a stray, but that seemed to be the kind of wife demanded\\nof me. She was allied to rogues if not villains, I knew; but then had\\nshe not cut all connection with them, dropped away from them, planted\\nher feet on new ground which they would never invade? I commenced to\\ncherish the idea. With this friendless, grateful, unassuming protegee of\\nmine for a wife, I would be as little bound as might be. She would\\nask nothing, and I need give nothing, beyond a home and the common\\nattentions required of a gentleman and a friend. Then she was not\\ndisagreeable, nor was her beauty of a type to suggest the charms of\\nher I had lost. None of the graces of the haughty patrician lady whose\\nlightest gesture was a command, would appear in this humble girl, to\\nmock and constrain me. No, I should have a fair wife and an obedient\\none, but no vulgarized shadow of Evelyn, thank God, or of any of her\\nfashionably dressed friends.\\n\\n“Advanced thus far towards the end, I went to see Luttra. I had not\\nbeheld her since the morning we parted at the door of that little\\ncottage in Vermont, and her presence caused me a shock. This, the humble\\nwaif with the appealing grateful eyes I had expected to encounter? this\\ntall and slender creature with an aureola of golden hair about a face\\nthat it was an education to behold! I felt a half movement of anger as I\\nsurveyed her. I had been cheated; I had planted a grape seed and a palm\\ntree had sprung up in its place. I was so taken aback, my salute lost\\nsomething of the benevolent condescension I had intended to infuse into\\nit. She seemed to feel my embarassment and a half smile fluttered to\\nher lips. That smile decided me. It was sweet but above all else it was\\nappealing.\\n\\n“How I won that woman to marry me in ten days time I care not to\\nstate. Not by holding up my wealth and position before her. Something\\nrestrained me from that. I was resolved, and perhaps it was the only\\npoint of light in my conduct at that time, not to buy this young girl. I\\nnever spoke of my expectations, I never alluded to my present advantages\\nyet I won her.\\n\\n“We were married, there, in Troy in the quietest and most unpretending\\nmanner. Why the fact has never transpired I cannot say. I certainly took\\nno especial pains to conceal it at the time, though I acknowledge\\nthat after our separation I did resort to such measures as I thought\\nnecessary, to suppress what had become gall and wormwood to my pride.\\n\\n“My first move after the ceremony was to bring her immediately to New\\nYork and to this house. With perhaps a pardonable bitterness of spirit,\\nI had refrained from any notification of my intentions, and it was as\\nstrangers might enter an unprepared dwelling, that we stepped across the\\nthreshold of this house and passed immediately to my father’s room.\\n\\n“‘I can give you no wedding and no honeymoon,’ I had told her. ‘My\\nfather is dying and demands my care. From the altar to a death-bed may\\nbe sad for you, but it is an inevitable condition of your marriage with\\nme.’ And she had accepted her fate with a deep unspeakable smile it has\\ntaken me long months of loneliness and suffering to understand.\\n\\n“‘Father, I bring you my bride,’ were my first words to him as the door\\nclosed behind us shutting us in with the dread, invisible Presence that\\nfor so long a time had been relentlessly advancing upon our home.\\n\\n“I shall never forget how he roused himself in his bed, nor with what\\neager eyes he read her young face and surveyed her slight form swaying\\ntowards him in her sudden emotion like a flame in a breeze. Nor while I\\nlive shall I lose sight of the spasm of uncontrollable joy with which\\nhe lifted his aged arms towards her, nor the look with which she sprang\\nfrom my side and nestled, yes nestled, on the breast that never to my\\nremembrance had opened itself to me even in the years of my earliest\\nchildhood. For my father was a stern man who believed in holding love at\\narm’s length and measured affection by the depth of awe it inspired.\\n\\n“‘My daughter!’ broke from his lips, and he never inquired who she was\\nor what; no, not even when after a moment of silence she raised her head\\nand with a sudden low cry of passionate longing looked in his face and\\nmurmured,\\n\\n“‘I never had a father.’\\n\\n“Sirs, it is impossible for me to continue without revealing depths\\nof pride and bitterness in my own nature, from which I now shrink with\\nunspeakable pain. So far from being touched by this scene, I felt myself\\ngrow hard under it. If he had been disappointed in my choice, queried\\nat it or even been simply pleased at my obedience, I might have accepted\\nthe wife I had won, and been tolerably grateful. But to love her, admire\\nher, glory in her when Evelyn Blake had never succeeded in winning a\\nglance from his eyes that was not a public disapprobation! I could\\nnot endure it; my whole being rebelled, and a movement like hate took\\npossession of me.\\n\\n“Bidding my wife to leave me with my father alone, I scarcely waited\\nfor the door to close upon the poor young thing before all that had been\\nseething in my breast for a month, burst from me in the one cry,\\n\\n“‘I have brought you a daughter as you commanded me. Now give me the\\nblessing you promised and let me go; for I cannot live with a woman I do\\nnot love.’\\n\\n“Instantly, and before his lips could move, the door opened and the\\nwoman I thus repudiated in the first dawning hour of her young bliss,\\nstood before us. My God! what a face! When I think of it now in the\\nnight season--when from dreams that gloomy as they are, are often\\nelysian to the thoughts which beset me in my waking hours, I suddenly\\narouse to see starting upon me from the surrounding shadows that young\\nfair brow with its halo of golden tresses, blotted, ay blotted by the\\nagony that turned her that instant into stone, I wonder I did not take\\nout the pistol that lay in the table near which I stood, and shoot her\\nlifeless on the spot as some sort of a compensation for the misery I had\\ncaused her. I say I wonder now: then I only thought of braving it out.\\n\\n“Straight as a dart, but with that look on her face, she came towards\\nus. ‘Did I hear aright?’ were the words that came from her lips. ‘Have\\nyou married me, a woman beneath your station as I now perceive, because\\nyou were commanded to do so? Have you not loved me? given me that which\\nalone makes marriage a sacrament or even a possibility? and must you\\nleave this house made sacred by the recumbent form of your dying father\\nif I remain within it?’\\n\\n“I saw my father’s stiff and pallid lips move silently as though\\nhe would answer for me if he could, and summoning up what courage I\\npossessed, I told her that I deeply regretted she had overheard my\\ninconsiderate words. That I had never meant to wound her, whatever\\nbitterness lay in my heart towards one who had thwarted me in my dearest\\nand most cherished hopes. That I humbly begged her pardon and would so\\nfar acknowledge her claim upon me as to promise that I would not leave\\nmy home at this time, if it distressed her; my desire being not to\\ninjure her, only to protect myself.\\n\\n“O the scorn that mounted to her brow at these weak words. Not scorn of\\nme, thank God, worthy as I was of it that hour, but scorn of my slight\\nopinion of her.\\n\\n“‘Then I heard aright,’ she murmured, and waited with a look that would\\nnot be gainsaid.\\n\\n“I could only bow my head, cursing the day I was born.\\n\\n“‘Holman! Holman!’ came in agonized entreaty from the bed, ‘you will not\\nrob me of my daughter now?’\\n\\n“Startled, I looked up. Luttra was half way to the door.\\n\\n“‘What are you going to do?’ cried I, bounding towards her.\\n\\n“She stopped me with a look. ‘The son must never forsake the father,’\\nsaid she. ‘If either of us must leave the house this day, let it be I.’\\nThen in a softer tone, ‘When you asked me to be your wife, I who had\\nworshipped you from the moment you entered my father’s house on the\\nmemorable night I left it, was so overcome at your condescension that\\nI forgot you did not preface it by the usual passionate, ‘I love you,’\\nwhich more than the marriage ring binds two hearts together. In the\\nglamour and glow of my joy, I did not see that the smile that was in my\\nheart, was missing from your face. I was to be your wife and that was\\nenough, or so I thought then, for I loved you. Ah, and I do now, my\\nhusband, love you so that I leave you. Were it for your happiness I\\nwould do more than that, I would give you back your freedom, but from\\nwhat I hear, it seems that you need a wife in name and I will be but\\nfulfilling your desire in holding that place for you. I will never\\ndisgrace the position high as it is above my poor deserts. When the day\\ncomes--if the day comes--that you need or feel you need the sustainment\\nof my presence or the devotion of my heart, no power on earth save that\\nof death itself, shall keep me from your side. Till that day arrives I\\nremain what you have made me, a bride who lays no claim to the name\\nyou this morning bestowed upon her.’ And with a gesture that was like a\\nbenediction, she turned, and noiselessly, breathlessly as a dream that\\nvanishes, left the room.\\n\\n“Sirs, I believe I uttered a cry and stumbled towards her. Some one in\\nthat room uttered a cry, but it may be that it only rose in my heart and\\nthat the one I heard came from my father’s lips. For when at the door\\nI turned, startled at the deathly silence, I saw he had fainted on his\\npillow. I could not leave him so. Calling to Mrs. Daniels, who was never\\nfar from my father in those days, I bade her stop the lady--I believe\\nI called her my wife--who was going down the stairs, and then rushed to\\nhis side. It took minutes to revive him. When he came to himself it was\\nto ask for the creature who had flashed like a beacon of light upon his\\ndarkening path. I rose as if to fetch her but before I could advance I\\nheard a voice say, ‘She is not here,’ and looking up I saw Mrs. Daniels\\nglide into the room.\\n\\n“‘Mrs. Blake has gone, sir, I could not keep her.’”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII. A MAN’S HEART\\n\\n\\n“That was the last time my eyes ever rested upon my wife. Whither she\\nwent or what refuge she gained, I never knew. My father who had received\\nin this scene a great shock, began to fail so rapidly, he demanded my\\nconstant care; and though from time to time as I ministered to him and\\nnoted with what a yearning persistency he would eye the door and then\\nturn and meet my gaze with a look I could not understand, I caught\\nmyself asking whether I had done a deed destined to hang forever about\\nme like a pall; it was not till after his death that the despairing\\nimage of the bright young creature to whom I had given my name, returned\\nwith any startling distinctness to my mind, or that I allowed myself to\\nask whether the heavy gloom which I now felt settling upon me was owing\\nto the sense of shame that overpowered me at the remembrance of the\\npast, or to the possible loss I had sustained in the departure of my\\nyoung unloved bride.\\n\\n“The announcement at this time of the engagement between Evelyn Blake\\nand the Count De Mirac may have had something to do with this. Though I\\nhad never in the most passionate hours of my love for her, lost sight of\\nthat side of her nature which demanded as her right the luxury of great\\nwealth; and though in my tacit abandonment of her and secret marriage\\nwith another I had certainly lost the right to complain of her actions\\nwhatever they might be, this manifest surrendering of herself to the\\npower of wealth and show at the price of all that women are believed to\\nhold dear, was an undoubted blow to my pride and the confidence I\\nhad till now unconsciously reposed in her inherent womanliness and\\naffection. That she had but made on a more conspicuous scale, the same\\nsacrifice as myself to the god of Wealth and Position, was in my eyes\\nat that time, no palliation of her conduct. I was a man none too good\\nor exalted at the best; she, a woman, should have been superior to the\\ntemptations that overpowered me. That she was not, seemed to drag all\\nwomanhood a little nearer the dust; fashionable womanhood I ought to\\nsay, for somehow even at that early day her conduct did not seem to\\naffect the vivid image of Luttra standing upon my threshold, shorn of\\nher joy but burning with a devotion I did not comprehend, and saying,\\n\\n“‘I loved you. Ah, and I do yet, my husband, love you so that I leave\\nyou. When the day comes--if the day comes--you need or feel you need\\nthe sustainment of my presence or the devotion of my heart, no power on\\nearth save that of death itself, shall keep me from your side.’\\n\\n“Yes, with the fading away of other faces and other forms, that face and\\nthat form now began to usurp the chief place in my thoughts. Not to my\\nrelief and pleasure. That could scarcely be, remembering all that had\\noccurred; rather to my increasing distress and passionate resentment.\\nI longed to forget I was held by a tie, that known to the world would\\ncause me the bitterest shame. For by this time the true character of\\nher father and brother had been revealed and I found myself bound to the\\ndaughter of a convicted criminal.\\n\\n“But I could not forget her. The look with which she had left me was\\nbranded into my consciousness. Night and day it floated before me, till\\nto escape it I resolved to fasten it upon canvas, if by that means I\\nmight succeed in eliminating it from my dreams.\\n\\n“The painting you have seen this night is the result. Born with an\\nartist’s touch and insight that under other circumstances might,\\nperhaps, have raised me into the cold dry atmosphere of fame, the\\nexecution of this piece of work, presented but few difficulties to my\\nsomewhat accustomed hand. Day by day her beauty grew beneath my brush,\\nstartling me often with its spiritual force and significance till my\\nmind grew feverish over its work, and I could scarcely refrain from\\nrising at night to give a touch here or there to the floating golden\\nhair or the piercing, tender eyes turned, ah, ever turned upon the\\ninmost citadel of my heart with that look that slew my father before his\\ntime and made me, yes me, old in spirit even in the ardent years of my\\nfirst manhood.\\n\\n“At last it was finished and she stood before me life-like and real in\\nthe very garments and with almost the very aspect of that never to be\\nforgotten moment. Even the roses which in the secret uneasiness of my\\nconscience I had put in her hand on our departure from Troy, as a sort\\nof visible token that I regarded her as my bride, and which through all\\nher interview with my father she had never dropped, blossomed before\\nme on the canvas. Nothing that could give reality to the likeness,\\nwas lacking; the vision of my dreams stood embodied in my sight, and I\\nlooked for peace. Alas, that picture now became my dream.\\n\\n“Inserting it behind that of Evelyn which for two years had held its\\nplace above my armchair, I turned its face to the wall when I rose in\\nthe morning. But at night it beamed ever upon me, becoming as the months\\npassed, the one thing to hold to and muse over when the world grew a\\nlittle noisy in my ears and the never ceasing conflict of the ages beat\\na trifle too loudly on heart and brain.\\n\\n“Meanwhile no word of her, only of her villainous father and brother; no\\ntoken that she had escaped evil or was removed from want. If I had loved\\nher I could not have succored her, for I did not know where to find her.\\nHer countenance illumined my wall, but her fair young self lay for all I\\nknew sheltered within the darkness and silence of the tomb.\\n\\n“At length my morbid broodings worked out their natural result. A dull\\nmelancholy settled upon me which nothing could break. Even the news that\\nmy cousin who had lost her husband a month after marriage, had returned\\nto America with expectation to remain, scarcely caused a ripple in my\\napathy. Was I sinking into a hypochrondriac? or was my passion for the\\nbeautiful brunette dead? I determined to solve the doubt.\\n\\n“Seeking her where I knew she would be found, I gazed again upon her\\nbeauty. It was absolutely nothing to me. A fair young face with high\\nthoughts in every glance floated like sunshine between us and I left the\\nhaughty Countess, with the knowledge burned deep into my brain, that the\\nlove I had considered slain was alive and demanding, but that the object\\nof it past recall, was my lost young wife.\\n\\n“Once assured of this, my apathy vanished like mist before a kindled\\ntorch. Henceforth the future held a hope, and life a purpose. I would\\nseek my wife throughout the world and bring her back if I found her\\nin prison between the men whose existence was a curse to my pride. But\\nwhere should I turn my steps? What golden thread had she left in my hand\\nby which to trace her through the labyrinth of this world? I could think\\nof but one, and that was the love which would restrain her from going\\naway from me too far. The Luttra of old would not leave the city where\\nher husband lived. If she was not changed, I ought to be able to find\\nher somewhere within this great Babylon of ours. Wisdom told me to\\nset the police upon her track, but pride bade me try every other means\\nfirst. So with the feverish energy of one leading a forlorn hope, I\\nbegan to pace the streets if haply I might see her face shine upon me\\nfrom the crowd of passers by; a foolish fancy, unproductive of result! I\\nnot only failed to see her, but anyone like her.\\n\\n“In the midst of the despair occasioned by this failure a thought flashed\\nacross me or rather a remembrance. One night not long since, being\\nuncommonly restless, I had risen from my bed, dressed me and gone out\\ninto the yard back of my house for a little air. It was an unusual thing\\nfor me to do but I seemed to be suffocating where I was, and nothing\\nelse would satisfy me. As you already surmise, it was the night on which\\ndisappeared the sewing girl of which you have so often spoken, but I\\nknew nothing of that, my thoughts were far from my own home and its\\nconcerns. You may judge what a state of mind I was in when I tell you\\nthat I even thought at one moment while I paused before the gate leading\\ninto ---- Street that I saw the face of her with whom my thoughts were\\never busy, peering upon me through the bars.\\n\\n“You tell me that I did see a girl there, and that it was the one who\\nhad lived as sewing woman in my house; it may be so, but at the time I\\nconsidered it a vision of my wife, and the remembrance of it, coming as\\nit did after my repeated failures to encounter her in the street, worked\\na change in my plans. For regard it as weakness or not, the recollection\\nthat the vision I had seen wore the garments of a working-woman rather\\nthan a lady, acted upon me like a warning not to search for her any\\nlonger among the resorts of the well-dressed, but in the regions of\\npoverty and toil. I therefore took to wanderings such as I have no heart\\nto describe. Nor do I need to, if, as you have informed me, I have been\\nfollowed.\\n\\n“The result was almost madness. Though deep in my heart I felt a\\nsteadfast trust in the purity of her intentions, the fear of what she\\nmight have been driven to by the awful poverty and despair I every day\\nsaw seething about me, was like hot steel in brain and heart. Then her\\nfather and her brother! To what might they not have forced her, innocent\\nand loving soul though she was! Drinking the dregs of a cup such as I\\nhad never considered it possible for me to taste, I got so far as to\\nbelieve that her eyes would yet flash upon me from beneath some of the\\ntattered shawls I saw sullying the forms of the young girls upon which I\\nhourly stumbled. Yes, and even made a move to see my cousin, if haply I\\ncould so win upon her compassion as to gain her consent to shelter the\\npoor creature of my dreams in case the necessity came. But my heart\\nfailed me at the sight of her cold face above the splendor she had\\nbought with her charms, and I was saved a humiliation I might never have\\nrisen above.\\n\\n“At last, one day I saw a girl--no, it was not she, but her hair was\\nsimilar to hers in hue, and the impulse to follow her was irresistible.\\nI did more than that, I spoke to her. I asked her if she could tell me\\nanything of one whose locks were golden red like hers--But I need not\\ntell you what I said nor what she replied with a gentle delicacy that\\nwas almost a shock to me as showing from what heights to what depths a\\nwoman can fall. Enough that nothing passed between us beyond what I have\\nintimated, and that in all she said she gave me no news of Luttra.\\n\\n“Next day I started for the rambling old house in Vermont, if haply\\nin the spot where I first saw her, I might come upon some clue to her\\npresent whereabouts. But the old inn was deserted, and whatever hope I\\nmay have had in that direction, perished with the rest.\\n\\n“Concerning the contents of that bureau-drawer above, I can say nothing.\\nIf, as I scarcely dare to hope, they should prove to have been indeed\\nbrought here by the girl who has since disappeared so strangely, who\\nknows but what in those folded garments a clue is given which will lead\\nme at last to the knowledge for which I would now barter all I possess.\\nMy wife--But I can mention her name no more till the question that now\\nassails us is set at rest. Mrs. Daniels must--”\\n\\nBut at that moment the door opened and Mrs. Daniels came in.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV. MRS. DANIELS\\n\\n\\nShe still wore her bonnet and shawl and her face was like marble.\\n\\n“You want me?” said she with a hurried look towards Mr. Blake that had\\nas much fear as surprise in it.\\n\\n“Yes,” murmured that gentleman moving towards her with an effort we\\ncould very well appreciate. “Mrs. Daniels, who was the girl you harbored\\nin that room above us for so long? Speak; what was her name and where\\ndid she come from?”\\n\\nThe housekeeper trembling in every limb, cast us one hurried appeal.\\n\\n“Speak!” reechoed Mr. Gryce; “the time for secrecy has passed.”\\n\\n“O,” cried she, sinking into a chair from sheer inability to stand, “it\\nwas your wife, Mr. Blake, the young creature you--”\\n\\n“Ah!”\\n\\nAll the agony, the hopelessness, the love, the passion of those last few\\nmonths flashed up in that word. She stopped as if she had been shot, but\\nseeing the hand which he had hurriedly raised, fall slowly before him,\\nwent on with a burst,\\n\\n“O sir, she made me swear on my knees I would never betray her, no\\nmatter what happened. When not two weeks after your father died she came\\nto the house and asking for me, told me all her story and all her love;\\nhow she could not reconcile it with her idea of a wife’s duty to live\\nunder any other roof than that of her husband, and lifting off the black\\nwig which she wore, showed me how altered she had made herself by that\\nsimple change--in her case more marked by the fact that her eyes were\\nin keeping with black hair, while with her own bright locks they always\\ngave you a shock as of something strange and haunting--I gave up my will\\nas if forced by a magnetic power, and not only opened the house to her\\nbut my heart as well; swearing to all she demanded and keeping my oath\\ntoo, as I would preserve my soul from sin and my life from the knife of\\nthe destroyer.”\\n\\n“But, when she went,” broke from the pallid lips of the man before her,\\n“when she was taken away from the house, what then?”\\n\\n“Ah,” returned the agitated woman, “what then! Do you not think I\\nsuffered? To be held by my oath, an oath I was satisfied she would wish\\nkept even at this crisis, yet knowing all the while she was drifting\\naway into some evil that you, if you knew who she was, would give your\\nlife to avert from your honor if not from her innocent head! To see you\\ncold, indifferent, absorbed in other things, while she, who would have\\nperished any day for your happiness, was losing her life perhaps in the\\nclutches of those horrible villains! Do not ask me to tell you what I\\nhave suffered since she went; I can never tell you,--innocent, tender,\\nnoble-hearted creature that she was.”\\n\\n“Was?” His hand clutched his heart as if it had been seized by a deathly\\nspasm. “Why do you say was?”\\n\\n“Because I have just come from the Morgue where she lies dead.”\\n\\n“No, no,” came in a low shriek from his lips, “that is not she; that is\\nanother woman, like her perhaps, but not she.”\\n\\n“Would to God you were right; but the long golden braids! Such hair as\\nhers I never saw on anyone before.”\\n\\n“Mr. Blake is right,” I broke in, for I could not endure this scene any\\nlonger. “The woman taken out of the East river to-day has been both seen\\nand spoken to by him and that not long since. He should know if it is\\nhis wife.”\\n\\n“And isn’t it?”\\n\\n“No, a thousand times no; the girl was a perfect stranger.”\\n\\nThe assurance seemed to lift a leaden weight from her heart. “O thank\\nGod,” she murmured dropping with an irresistible impulse on her knees.\\nThen with a sudden return of her old tremble, “But I was only to reveal\\nher secret in case of her death! What have I done, O what have I done!\\nHer only hope lay in my faithfulness.”\\n\\nMr. Blake leaning heavily on the table before him, looked in her face.\\n\\n“Mrs. Daniels,” said he, “I love my wife; her hope now lies in me.”\\n\\nShe leaped to her feet with a joyous bound. “You love her? O thank God!”\\n she again reiterated but this time in a low murmur to her self. “Thank\\nGod!” and weeping with unrestrained joy, she drew back into a corner.\\n\\nOf course after that, all that remained for us to do was to lay our\\nheads together and consult as to the best method of renewing our search\\nafter the unhappy girl, now rendered of double interest to us by the\\nfacts with which we had just been made acquainted. That she had been\\nforced away from the roof that sheltered her by the power of her father\\nand brother was of course no longer open to doubt. To discover them,\\ntherefore, meant to recover her. Do you wonder, then, that from the\\nmoment we left Mr. Blake’s house, the capture of that brace of thieves\\nbecame the leading purpose of our two lives?\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV. A CONFAB\\n\\n\\nNext morning Mr. Gryce and I met in serious consultation. How, and in\\nwhat direction should we extend the inquiries necessary to a discovery\\nof these Schoenmakers?\\n\\n“I advise a thorough overhauling of the German quarter,” said my\\nsuperior. “Schmidt, and Rosenthal will help us and the result ought to\\nbe satisfactory.”\\n\\nBut I shook my head at this. “I don’t believe,” said I, “that they will\\nhide among their own people. You must remember they are not alone, but\\nhave with them a young woman of a somewhat distinguished appearance,\\nwhose presence in a crowded district, like that, would be sure to awaken\\ngossip; something which above all else they must want to avoid.”\\n\\n“That is true; the Germans are a dreadful race for gossip.”\\n\\n“If they dared to ill-dress her or ill-treat her, it would be different.\\nBut she is a valuable piece of property to them you see, a choice lot\\nof goods which it is for their interest to preserve in first-class\\ncondition till the day comes for its disposal. For I presume you have no\\ndoubt that it is for the purpose of extorting money from Mr. Blake that\\nthey have carried off his young wife.”\\n\\n“For that reason or one similar. He is a man of resources, they may have\\nhoped he would help them to escape the country.”\\n\\n“If they don’t hide in the German quarter they certainly won’t in the\\nItalian, French or Irish. What they want is too keep close and rouse\\nno questions. I think they will be found to have gone up the river\\nsomewhere, or over to Jersey. Hoboken would’nt be a bad place to send\\nSchmidt to.”\\n\\n“You forget what it is they’ve got on their minds; besides no\\nconspicuous party such as they could live in a rural district without\\nattracting more attention than in the most crowded tenement house in the\\ncity.”\\n\\n“Where do you think, then, they would be liable to go?”\\n\\n“Well my most matured thought on the subject,” returned Mr. Gryce, after\\na moment’s deliberation, “is this,--you say, and I agree, that they\\nhave hampered themselves with this woman at this time for the purpose of\\nusing her hereafter in a scheme of black-mail upon Mr. Blake. He, then,\\nmust be the object about which their thoughts revolve and toward which\\nwhatever operations or plans they may be engaged upon must tend. What\\nfollows? When a company of men have made up their minds to rob a bank,\\nwhat is the first thing they do? They hire, if possible, a house next to\\nthe especial building they intend to enter, and for months work upon\\nthe secret passage through which they hope to reach the safe and\\nits contents; or they make friends with the watchman that guards its\\ntreasures, and the janitor who opens and shuts the doors. In short they\\nhang about their prey before they pounce upon it. And so will these\\nSchoenmakers do in the somewhat different robbery which they plan sooner\\nor later to effect. Whatever may keep them close at this moment, Mr.\\nBlake and Mr. Blake’s house is the point toward which their eyes are\\nturned, and if we had time--”\\n\\n“But we have’nt,” I broke in impetuously. “It is horrible to think of\\nthat grand woman languishing away in the power of such rascals.”\\n\\n“If we had time,” Mr. Gryce persisted, “all it would be necessary to do\\nwould be to wait, they would come into our hands as easily and naturally\\nas a hawk into the snare of the fowler. But as you say we have not, and\\ntherefore, I would recommend a little beating of the bush directly about\\nMr. Blake’s house; for if all my experience is not at fault, those men\\nare already within eye-shot of the prey they intend to run down.”\\n\\n“But,” said I, “I have been living myself in that very neighborhood and\\nknow by this time the ways of every house in the vicinity. There is not\\na spot up and down the Avenue for ten blocks where they could hide away\\nfor two days much less two weeks. And as for the side streets,--why\\nI could tell you the names of those who live in each house for a\\nconsiderable distance. Yet if you say so I will go to work--”\\n\\n“Do, and meanwhile Schmidt and Rosenthal shall rummage the German\\nquarter and even go through Williamsburgh and Hoboken. The end justifies\\nany amount of labor that can be spent upon this matter.”\\n\\n“And you,” I asked.\\n\\n“Will do my part when you have done yours.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI. THE MARK OF THE RED CROSS\\n\\n\\nAnd what success did I meet? The best in the world. And by what means\\ndid I attain it? By that of the simplest, prettiest clue I ever came\\nupon. But let me explain.\\n\\nWhen after a wearisome day spent in an ineffectual search through the\\nneighborhood, I went home to my room, which as you remember was a front\\none in a lodging-house on the opposite corner from Mr. Blake, I was so\\nabsorbed in mind and perhaps I may say shaken in nerve, by the strain\\nunder which I had been laboring for some time now, that I stumbled up an\\nextra flight of stairs, and without any suspicion of the fact, tried\\nthe door of the room directly over mine. It is a wonder to me now that I\\ncould have made the mistake, for the halls were totally dissimilar,\\nthe one above being much more cut up than the one below, besides being\\nflanked by a greater number of doors. But the intoxication of the mind\\nis not far removed from that of the body, and as I say it was not till\\nI had tried the door and found it locked, that I became aware of the\\nmistake I had made.\\n\\nWith the foolish sense of shame that always overcomes us at the\\ncommittal of any such trivial error, I stumbled hastily back, when my\\nfoot trod upon something that broke under my weight. I never let even\\nsmall things pass without some notice. Stooping, then, for what I had\\nthus inadvertently crushed, I carried it to where a single gas jet\\nturned down very low, made a partial light in the long hall, and\\nexamining it, found it to be a piece of red chalk.\\n\\nWhat was there in that simple fact to make me start and hastily recall\\none or two half-forgotten incidents which, once brought to mind, awoke\\na train of thought that led to the discovery and capture of those two\\ndesperate thieves? I will tell you.\\n\\nI don’t remember now whether in my account of the visit I paid to\\nthe Schoenmakers’ house in Vermont, I informed you of the red cross I\\nnoticed scrawled on the panel of one of the doors. It seemed a trivial\\nthing at the time and made little or no impression upon me, the chances\\nbeing that I should never have thought of it again, if I had not come\\nupon the article just mentioned at a moment when my mind was full of\\nthose very Schoenmakers. But remembered now, together with another\\nhalf-forgotten fact,--that some days previous I had been told by the\\nwoman who kept the house I was in, that the parties over my head (two\\nmen and a woman I believe she said) were giving her some trouble, but\\nthat they paid well and therefore she did not like to turn them out,--it\\naroused a vague suspicion in my mind, and led to my walking back to the\\ndoor I had endeavored to open in my abstraction, and carefully looking\\nat it.\\n\\nIt was plain and white, rather ruder of make than those below, but\\noffering no inducements for prolonged scrutiny. But not so with the\\none that stood at right angles to it on the left. Full in the centre\\nof that, I beheld distinctly scrawled, probably with the very piece of\\nchalk I then held, a red cross precisely similar in outline to the one\\nI had seen a few days before on the panel of the Schoenmakers’ door at\\nGranby.\\n\\nThe discovery sent a thrill over me that almost raised my hair on end.\\nWas, then, this famous trio to be found in the very house in which I had\\nbeen myself living for a week or more? over my head in fact? I could\\nnot withdraw my gaze from the mysterious looking object. I bent near, I\\nlistened, I heard what sounded like the suppressed snore of a powerful\\nman, and almost had to lay hold of myself to prevent my hand from\\npushing open that closed door and my feet from entering. As it was I did\\nfinger the knob a little, but an extra loud snore from within reminded\\nme by its suggestion of strength that I was but a small man and that in\\nthis case and at this hour, discretion was the better part of valor.\\n\\nI therefore withdrew, but for the whole night lay awake listening to\\ncatch any sounds that might come from above, and going so far as to plan\\nwhat I would do if it should be proved that I was indeed upon the trail\\nof the men I was so anxious to encounter.\\n\\nWith the breaking of day I was upon my feet. A rude step had gone up\\nthe stairs a few minutes before and I was all alert to follow. But\\nI presently considered that my wisest course would be to sound the\\nlandlady and learn if possible with what sort of characters I had to\\ndeal. Routing her out of the kitchen, where at that early hour she was\\nalready engaged in domestic duties, I drew her into a retired corner and\\nput my questions. She was not backward in replying. She had conceived an\\ninnocent liking for me in the short time I had been with her--a display\\nof weakness for which I was myself, perhaps, as much to blame as\\nshe--and was only too ready to pour out her griefs into my sympathizing\\near. For those men were a grief to her, acceptable as was the money\\nthey were careful to provide her with. They were not only always in the\\nhouse, that is one of them, smoking his old pipe and blackening up the\\nwalls, but they looked so shabby, and kept the girl so close, and if\\nthey did go out, came in at such unheard of hours. It was enough to\\ndrive her crazy; yet the money, the money--\\n\\n“Yes,” said I, “I know; and the money ought to make you overlook all\\nthe small disagreeablenesses you mention. What is a landlady without\\npatience.” And I urged her not to turn them out.\\n\\n“But the girl,” she went on, “so nice, so quiet, so sick-looking! I\\ncannot stand it to see her cooped up in that small room, always watched\\nover by one or both of those burly wretches. The old man says she is\\nhis daughter and she does not deny it, but I would as soon think of that\\nlittle rosy child you see cooing in the window over the way, belonging\\nto the beggar going in at the gate, as of her with her lady-like ways\\nhaving any connection with him and his rough-acting son. You ought to\\nsee her--”\\n\\n“That is just what I want to do,” interrupted I. “Not because you have\\ntempted my fancy by a recital of her charms,” I hastened to add, “but\\nbecause she is, if I don’t mistake, a woman for whose discovery and\\nrescue, a large sum of money has been offered.”\\n\\nAnd without further disguise I acquainted the startled woman before me\\nwith the fact that I was not, as she had always considered, the clerk\\nout of employment whose daily business it was to sally forth in quest of\\na situation, but a member of the city police.\\n\\nShe was duly impressed and easily persuaded to second all my operations\\nas far as her poor wits would allow, giving me free range of her upper\\nstory, and above all, promising that secrecy without which all my finely\\nlaid plans for capturing the rogues without raising a scandal, would\\nfall headlong to the ground.\\n\\nBehold me, then, by noon of that same day domiciled in an apartment next\\nto the one whose door bore that scarlet sign which had aroused within\\nme such feverish hopes the night before. Clad in the seedy garments of\\na broken down French artist whose acquaintance I had once made, with\\nsomething of his air and general appearance and with a few of his\\nwretched daubs hung about on the whitewashed wall, I commenced with\\nevery prospect of success as I thought, that quiet espionage of the hall\\nand its inhabitants which I considered necessary to a proper attainment\\nof the end I had in view.\\n\\nA racking cough was one of the peculiarities of my friend, and\\ndetermined to assume the character in toto, I allowed myself to startle\\nthe silence now and then with a series of gasps and chokings that\\nwhether agreeable or not, certainly were of a character to show that I\\nhad no desire to conceal my presence from those I had come among. Indeed\\nit was my desire to acquaint them as fully and as soon as possible with\\nthe fact of their having a neighbor: a weak-eyed half-alive innocent\\nto be sure, but yet a neighbor who would keep his door open night and\\nday--for the warmth of the hall of course--and who with the fretful\\nhabit of an old man who had once been a gentleman and a beau, went\\nrambling about through the hall speaking to those he met and expecting\\na civil word in return. When he was not rambling or coughing he made\\narchitectural monsters out of cardboard, wherewith to tempt the pennies\\nout of the pockets of unwary children, an employment that kept him\\nchained to a small table in the centre of his room directly opposite the\\nopen door.\\n\\nAs I expected I had scarcely given way to three separate fits of\\ncoughing, when the door next me opened with a jerk and a rough voice\\ncalled out,\\n\\n“Who’s that making all that to do about here? If you don’t stop that\\ninfernal noise in a hurry--”\\n\\nA soft voice interrupted him and he drew back. “I will go see,” said\\nthose gentle tones, and Luttra Blake, for I knew it was she before the\\nskirt of her robe had advanced beyond the door, stepped out into the\\nhall.\\n\\nI was yet bent over my work when she paused before me. The fact is I did\\nnot dare look up, the moment was one of such importance to me.\\n\\n“You have a dreadful cough,” said she with that low ring of sympathy in\\nher voice that goes unconsciously to the heart. “Is there no help for\\nit?”\\n\\nI pushed back my work, drew my hand over my eyes, (I did not need to\\nmake it tremble) and glanced up. “No,” said I with a shake of my head,\\n“but it is not always so bad. I beg your pardon, miss, if it disturbs\\nyou.”\\n\\nShe threw back the shawl which she had held drawn tightly over her head,\\nand advanced with an easy gliding step close to my side. “You do not\\ndisturb me, but my father is--is, well a trifle cross sometimes, and if\\nhe should speak up a little harsh now and then, you must not mind. I am\\nsorry you are so ill.”\\n\\nWhat is there in some women’s look, some women’s touch that more than\\nall beauty goes to the heart and subdues it. As she stood there before\\nme in her dark worsted dress and coarse shawl, with her locks simply\\nbraided and her whole person undignified by art and ungraced by\\nornament, she seemed just by the power of her expression and the\\nwitchery of her manner, the loveliest woman I had ever beheld.\\n\\n“You are veree kind, veree good,” I murmured, half ashamed of my\\ndisguise, though it was assumed for the purpose of rescuing her. “Your\\nsympathy goes to my heart.” Then as a deep growl of impatience rose from\\nthe room at my side, I motioned her to go and not irritate the man who\\nseemed to have such control over her.\\n\\n“In a minute,” answered she, “first tell me what you are making.”\\n\\nSo I told her and in the course of telling, let drop such other facts\\nabout my fancied life as I wished to have known to her and through her\\nto her father. She looked sweetly interested and more than once turned\\nupon me that dark eye, of which I had heard so much, full of tears that\\nwere as much for me, scamp that I was, as for her own secret trouble.\\nBut the growls becoming more and more impatient she speedily turned to\\ngo, repeating, however, as she did so,\\n\\n“Now remember what I say, you are not to be troubled if they do speak\\ncross to you. They make noise enough themselves sometimes, as you will\\ndoubtless be assured of to-night.”\\n\\nAnd the lips which seemed to have grown stiff and cold with her misery,\\nactually softened into something like a smile.\\n\\nThe nod which I gave her in return had the solemnity of a vow in it.\\n\\nMy mind thus assured as to the correctness of my suspicions, and the way\\nthus paved to the carrying out of my plans, I allowed some few days\\nto elapse without further action on my part. My motive was to acquaint\\nmyself as fully as possible with the habits and ways of these two\\ndesperate men, before making the attempt to capture them upon which so\\nmany interests hung. For while I felt it would be highly creditable to\\nmy sagacity, as well as valuable to my reputation as a detective, to\\nrestore these escaped convicts in any way possible into the hands of\\njustice, my chief ambition after all was to so manage the affair as\\nto save the wife of Mr. Blake, not only from the consequences of their\\ndespair, but from the publicity and scandal attendant upon the open\\narrest of two heavily armed men. Strategy, therefore, rather than force\\nwas to be employed, and strategy to be successful must be founded upon\\nthe most thorough knowledge of the matter with which one has to deal.\\nThree days, then, did I give to the acquiring of that knowledge, the\\nresult of which was the possession of the following facts.\\n\\n1. That the landlady was right when she told me the girl was never left\\nalone, one of the men, if not the father then the son, always remaining\\nwith her.\\n\\n2. That while thus guarded, she was not so restricted but that she had\\nthe liberty of walking in the hall, though never for any length of time.\\n\\n3. That the cross on the door seemed to possess some secret meaning\\nconnected with their presence in the house, it having been erased one\\nevening when the whole three went out on some matter or other, only to\\nbe chalked on again when in an hour or so later, father and daughter\\nreturned alone.\\n\\n4. That it was the father and not the son who made such purchases as\\nwere needed, while it was the son and not the father who carried on\\nwhatever operations they had on hand; nightfall being the favorite\\nhour for the one and midnight for the other; though it not infrequently\\nhappened that the latter sauntered out for a short time also in the\\nafternoon, probably for the drink he could not go long without.\\n\\n5. That they were men of great strength but little alertness; the stray\\nglimpses I had had of them, revealing a breadth of back that was truly\\nformidable, if it had not been joined to a heaviness of motion that\\nproclaimed a certain stolidity of mind that was eminently in our favor.\\n\\nHow best to use these facts in the building up of a matured plan of\\naction, was, then, the problem. By noon of a certain day I believed\\nit to have been solved, and reluctant as I was to leave the spot of my\\nespionage even for the hour or two necessary to a visit to headquarters,\\nI found myself compelled to do so. Packing up in a small basket I had\\nfor the purpose, the little articles I had been engaged during the last\\nfew days in making, I gave way to a final fit of coughing so hollow and\\nsepulchral in its tone, that it awoke a curse from the next room deep as\\nthe growl of a wild beast, and still continuing, finally brought Luttra\\nto the door with that look of compassion on her face that always called\\nup a flush to my cheek whether I wished it or no.\\n\\n“Ah, Monsieur, I am afraid your cough is very bad to-day. O I see; you\\nhave been getting ready to go out--”\\n\\n“Come back here,” broke in a heavy voice from the room she had left.\\n“What do you mean by running off to palaver with that old rascal every\\ntime he opens his ----- battery of a cough?”\\n\\nA smile that went through me like the cut of a knife, flashed for a\\nmoment on her face.\\n\\n“My father is in one of his impatient moods,” said she, “you had better\\ngo. I hope you will be successful,” she murmured, glancing wistfully at\\nmy basket.\\n\\n“What is that?” again came thundering on our ears. “Successful? What are\\nyou two up to?” And we heard the rough clatter of advancing steps.\\n\\n“Go,” said she; “you are weak and old; and when you come back, try and\\nnot cough.” And she gave me a gentle push towards the door.\\n\\n“When I come back,” I began, but was forced to pause, the elder\\nSchoenmaker having by this time reached the open doorway where he stood\\nfrowning in upon us in a way that made my heart stand still for her.\\n\\n“What are you two talking about?” said he; “and what have you got in\\nyour basket there?” he continued with a stride forward that shook the\\nfloor.\\n\\n“Only some little toys that he has been making, and is now going out to\\nsell,” was her low answer given with a quick deprecatory gesture such as\\nI doubt if she ever used for herself.\\n\\n“Nothing more?” asked he in German with a red glare in the eye he turned\\ntowards her.\\n\\n“Nothing more,” replied she in the same tongue. “You may believe me.”\\n\\nHe gave a deep growl and turned away. “If there was,” said he, “you know\\nwhat would happen.” And unheeding the wild keen shudder that seized her\\nat the word, making her insensible for the moment to all and everything\\nabout her, he laid one heavy hand upon her slight shoulder and led her\\nfrom the room.\\n\\nI waited no longer than was necessary to carry my feeble and faltering\\nsteps appropriately down the stairs, to reach the floor below and gain\\nthe landlady’s presence.\\n\\n“Do you go up,” said I, “and sit on those stairs till I come back. If\\nyou hear the least cry of pain or sound of struggle from that young\\ngirl’s room, do you call at once for help. I will have a policeman\\nstanding on the corner below.”\\n\\nThe good woman nodded and proceeded at once to take up her work-basket.\\n“Lucky there’s a window up there, so I can see,” I heard her mutter.\\n“I’ve no time to throw away even on deeds of charity.”\\n\\nNotwithstanding which precaution, I was in constant anxiety during my\\nabsence; an absence necessarily prolonged as I had to stop and explain\\nmatters to the Superintendent, as well as hunt up Mr. Gryce and get his\\nconsent to assist me in the matter of the impending arrest.\\n\\nI found the latter in his own home and more than enthusiastic upon the\\nsubject.\\n\\n“Well,” said he after I had informed him of the discoveries I had made,\\n“the fates seem to prosper you in this. I have not received an inkling\\nof light upon the matter since I parted from you at Mr. Blake’s house.\\nBy the way I saw that gentleman this morning and I tell you we will find\\nhim a grateful man if this affair can be resolved satisfactorily.”\\n\\n“That is good,” said I,” gratitude is what we want.” Then shortly,\\n“Perhaps it is no more than our duty to let him know that his wife is\\nsafe and under my eye; though I would by no means advocate his knowing\\njust how near him she is, till the moment comes when he is wanted, or we\\nshall have a lover’s impetuosity to deal with as well as all the rest.”\\n Then with a hurried remembrance of a possible contingency, went on to\\nsay, “But, by the way, in case we should need the cooperation of Mrs.\\nBlake in what we have before us, you had better get a line written\\nin French from Mrs. Daniels, expressive of her belief in Mr. Blake’s\\npresent affection for his wife. The latter will not otherwise trust us,\\nor understand that we are to be obeyed in whatever we may demand. Let\\nit be unsigned and without names in case of accident; and if the\\nhousekeeper don’t understand French, tell her to get some one to help\\nher that does, only be sure that the handwriting employed is her own.”\\n\\nMr. Gryce seemed to perceive the wisdom of this precaution and promised\\nto procure me such a note by a certain hour, after which I related to\\nhim the various other details of the capture such as I had planned it,\\nmeeting to my secret gratification an unqualified approval that went far\\ntowards alleviating that wound to my pride which I had received from him\\nin the beginning of this affair.\\n\\n“Let all things proceed as you have determined, and we shall accomplish\\nsomething that it will be a life-long satisfaction to remember,” said\\nhe; “but you must be prepared for some twist of the screw which you\\ndo not anticipate. I never knew anything to go off just as one\\nprognosticates it must, except once,” he added thoughtfully, “and\\nthen it was with a surprise attached to it that well nigh upset me\\nnotwithstanding all my preparations.”\\n\\n“You won a great success that day,” remarked I. “I hope the fates will\\nbe as propitious to me to-morrow. Failure now would break my heart.”\\n\\n“But you won’t fail,” exclaimed he. “I myself am resolved to see you\\nthrough this matter with credit.”\\n\\nAnd in this assurance I returned to my lodgings where I found the\\nlandlady sitting where I had left her, darning her twenty-third sock.\\n\\n“I have to mend for a dozen men and three boys,” said she, “and the boys\\nare the worst by a heap sight. Look at that, will you,” holding up\\na darn with a bit of stocking attached. “That hole was made playing\\nshinny.”\\n\\nI uttered my condolences and asked if any sound or disturbance had\\nreached her ears from above.\\n\\n“O no, all is right up there; I’ve scarcely heard a whisper since you’ve\\nbeen gone.”\\n\\nI gave her a pat on the chin scarcely consistent with my aged and\\ntottering mien and proceeded to shamble painfully to my room.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII. THE CAPTURE\\n\\n\\nPromptly next morning at the designated hour, came the little note\\npromised me by Mr. Gryce. It was put in my hand with many sly winks by\\nthe landlady herself, who developed at this crisis quite an adaptation\\nfor, if not absolute love of intrigue and mystery. Glancing over it--it\\nwas unsealed--and finding it entirely unintelligible, I took it for\\ngranted it was all right and put it by till chance, or if that failed,\\nstrategy, should give me an opportunity to communicate with Mrs. Blake.\\nAn hour passed; the doors of their rooms remained unclosed. A half hour\\nmore dragged its slow minutes away, and no sound had come from their\\nprecincts save now and then a mumbled word of parley between the father\\nand son, a short command to the daughter, or a not-to-be-restrained oath\\nof annoyance from one or both of the heavy-limbed brutes as something\\nwas said or done to disturb them in their indolent repose. At last\\nmy impatience was to be no longer restrained. Rising, I took a bold\\nresolution. If the mountain would not come to Mahomet, Mahomet would go\\nto the mountain. Taking my letter in the hand, I deliberately proceeded\\nto the door marked with the ominous red cross and knocked.\\n\\nA surprised snarl from within, followed by a sudden shuffling of feet\\nas the two men leaped upright from what I presume had been a recumbent\\nposition, warned me to be ready to face defiance if not the fury of\\ndespair; and curbing with a determined effort the slight sinking of\\nheart natural to a man of my make on the threshold of a very doubtful\\nadventure, I awaited with as much apparent unconcern as possible, the\\nquick advance of that light foot which seemed to be ready to perform\\nall the biddings of these hardened wretches, much as it shrunk from\\nfollowing in the ways of their infamy.\\n\\n“Ah miss,” said I, as the door opened revealing in the gap her white\\nface clouded with some new and sudden apprehension, “I beg your pardon\\nbut I am an old man, and I got a letter to-day and my eyes are so weak\\nwith the work I’ve been doing that I cannot read it. It is from some one\\nI love, and would you be so kind as to read off the words for me and so\\nrelieve an old man from his anxiety.”\\n\\nThe murmur of suspicion behind her, warned her to throw wide open the\\ndoor. “Certainly,” said she, “if I can,” taking the paper in her hand.\\n\\n“Just let me get a squint at that first,” said a sullen voice behind\\nher; and the youngest of the two Schoenmakers stepped forward and tore\\nthe paper out of her grasp.\\n\\n“You are too suspicious,” murmured she, looking after him with the first\\nassumption of that air of power and determination which I had heard\\nso eloquently described by the man who loved her. “There is nothing in\\nthose lines which concerns us; let me have them back.”\\n\\n“You hold your tongue,” was the brutal reply as the rough man opened the\\nfolded paper and read or tried to read what was written within. “Blast\\nit! it’s French,” was his slow exclamation after a moment spent in\\nthis way. “See,” and he thrust it towards his father who stood frowning\\nheavily a few feet off.\\n\\n“Of course, it’s French,” cried the girl. “Would you write a note in\\nEnglish to father there? The man’s friends are French like himself, and\\nmust write in their own language.”\\n\\n“Here take it and read it out,” commanded her father; “and mind you\\ntell us what it means. I’ll have nothing going on here that I don’t\\nunderstand.”\\n\\n“Read me the French words first, miss,” said I. “It is my letter and I\\nwant to know what my friend has to say to me.”\\n\\nNodding at me with a gentle look, she cast her eyes on the paper and\\nbegan to read:\\n\\n    “Calmez vous, mon amie, il vous aime et il vous cherche. Dans\\n    quatre heures vous serez heureuse. Allons du courage, et surtout\\n    soyez maitre de vous meme.”\\n\\n“Thanks!” I exclaimed in a calm matter-of-fact way as I perceived the\\nsudden tremor that seized her as she recognized the handwriting and\\nrealized that the words were for her. “My friend says he will pay my\\nweek’s rent and bids me be at home to receive him,” said I, turning upon\\nthe two ferocious faces peering over her shoulder, with a look of meek\\nunsuspiciousness in my eye, that in a theatre would have brought down\\nthe house.\\n\\n“Is that what those words say, you?” asked the father, pointing over her\\nshoulder to the paper she held.\\n\\n“I will translate for you word by word what it says,” replied she,\\nnerving herself for the crisis till her face was like marble, though\\nI could see she could not prevent the gleam of secret rapture that had\\nvisited her, from flashing fitfully across it. “Calmez vous, mon amie.\\nDo not be afraid, my friend. Il vous aime et il vous cherche. He loves\\nyou and is hunting for you. Dans quatre heures vous serez heureuse. In\\nfour hours you will be happy. Allons du courage, et surtout soyez\\nmaitre de vous meme. Then take courage and above all preserve your\\nself-possession. It is the French way of expressing one’s self,”\\n observed she. “I am glad your friend is disposed to help you,” she\\ncontinued, giving me back the letter with a smile. “I am afraid you\\nneeded it.”\\n\\nIn a sort of maze I folded up the letter, bowed my very humble thanks to\\nher and shuffled slowly back. The fact is I had no words; I was utterly\\ndumbfounded. Half way through that letter, with whose contents you\\nmust remember I was unacquainted, I would have given my whole chance of\\nexpected reward to have stopped her. Read out such words as those before\\nthese men! Was she crazy? But how naturally at the conclusion did she\\nwith a word make its language seem consistent with the meaning I had\\ngiven it. With a fresh sense of my obligation to her, I hurried to my\\nroom, there to count out the minutes of another long hour in anxious\\nexpectation of her making that endeavor to communicate with me, which\\nher new hopes and fears must force her to feel almost necessary to her\\nexistence. At length, my confidence in her was rewarded. Coming out into\\nthe hall, she hurried past my door, her finger on her lip. I immediately\\nrose and stood on the threshold with another paper in my hand, which I\\nhad prepared against this opportunity. As she glided back, I put it in\\nher hand, and warning her with a look not to speak, resumed my usual\\noccupation. The words I had written were as follows:\\n\\n    At or as near the time as possible of your brother’s going out,\\n    you are to come to this room wrapped in an extra skirt and with\\n    your shawl over your head. Leave the skirt and shawl behind you,\\n    and withdraw at once to the room at the head of the stairs. You\\n    are not to speak, and you are not to vary from the plan thus laid\\n    down. Your brother and father are to be arrested, whether or no;\\n    but if you will do as this commands, they will be arrested without\\n    bloodshed and without shame to one you know.\\n\\nHer face while she read these lines, was a study, but I dared not soften\\ntoward it. Dropping the paper from her hand, she gave me one inquiring\\nlook. But I pointed determinedly to the words lying upward on the floor,\\nand would listen to no appeal. My resolve had its effect. Bowing her\\nhead with a sorrowful gesture, she laid her hand on her heart, looked up\\nand glided from the room. I took up that paper and tore it into bits.\\n\\nAnd now for the first time since I had been in the house, I closed the\\ndoor of my room. I had a part to perform that rendered the dropping of\\nmy disguise indispensable. The old French artist had finished his work,\\nand henceforth must merge into Q. the detective. Shortly before two\\no’clock my assistants began to arrive. First, Mr. Gryce appeared on the\\nscene and was stowed away in a large room on the other side of mine.\\nNext, two of the most agile, as well as muscular men in the force who,\\nthanks to having taken off their shoes in the lower hall, gained the\\nsame refuge without awakening the suspicions of those we were anxious to\\nsurprise. Lastly, the landlady who went into the closet to which I had\\nbidden Mrs. Blake retire after leaving in my room the articles I had\\nmentioned.\\n\\nAll was now ready and waiting for the departure of the youngest\\nSchoenmaker. Would he disappoint us and remain at home that day? Had any\\nsuspicions been awakened in the stolid breasts of these men, that would\\nserve to make them more watchful than usual against running unnecessary\\nrisks? No; at or near the time for the clock to strike two, their door\\nopened and the tread of a lumbering foot was heard in the hall. On it\\ncame, passing my room with a rude stamping that gradually grew less\\ndistinct as the hardy rough went down the corridor, brushing the wall\\nbehind which Mr. Gryce and his men lay concealed with his thick cane,\\nand even stopping to light his pipe in front of the small apartment\\nwhere cowered our good landlady with her eternal basket of mending in\\nher lap.\\n\\nAt length all was quiet, and throwing open my door, I withdrew into\\na small closet connected with my room, to wait with indescribable\\nimpatience, the appearance of Mrs. Blake. She came in a very few\\nminutes, remained for an instant, and departed, leaving behind her as\\nI had requested, the skirt and shawl in which she had left her father’s\\npresence. I at once endued myself in these articles of apparel--taking\\ncare to draw the shawl well over my head--and with a pocket handkerchief\\nto my face, (a proceeding made natural enough by the sneeze which at\\nthat very moment I took care should assail me) walked boldly back to the\\nroom from which she had just come.\\n\\nThe door was of course ajar, and as I swung it open with as near a\\nsimulation of her manner as possible, the vision of her powerful\\nfather lolling on a bench directly before me, offered anything but an\\nencouraging spectacle to my eyes. But doubling myself almost together\\nwith as ladylike an atch-ee as my masculine nostrils would allow, I\\nsucceeded in closing the door and reaching a low stool by the window\\nwithout calling from him anything worse than a fretful “I hope you are\\nnot going to bark too.”\\n\\nI did not reply to this of course, but sat with my face turned towards\\nthe street in an attitude which I hoped would awaken his attention\\nsufficiently to cause him to get up and come over to my side. For as he\\nsat face to the door it would be impossible to take him by surprise, and\\nthat, now that I saw what a huge and muscular creature he was, seemed\\nto me to be the only safe method before us. But, whether from the\\nsullenness of his disposition or the very evident laziness of the\\nmoment, he manifested no disposition to move, and hearing or thinking I\\ndid, the stealthy advance of Mr. Gryce and his companions down the hall,\\nI allowed myself to give way to a suppressed exclamation, and leaning\\nforward, pressed my forehead against the pane of glass before me as\\nif something of absorbing interest had just taken place in the street\\nbeneath.\\n\\nHis fears at once took alarm. Bounding up with a curse, he strode\\ntowards me, muttering,\\n\\n“What’s up now? What’s that you are looking at?” reaching my side just\\nas Mr. Gryce and his two men softly opened the door and with a quick\\nleap threw their arms about him, closing upon him with a force he could\\nnot resist, desperate as he was and mighty in the huge strength of an\\nunusually developed muscular organization.\\n\\n“You, you girl there, are to blame for this!” came mingled with curses\\nfrom his lips, as with one huge pant he submitted to his captors. “Only\\nlet me get my hand well upon you once--Damn it!” he suddenly exclaimed,\\ndragging the whole three men forward in his effort to get his mouth down\\nto my ear, “go and rub that sign out on the door or I’ll--you know what\\nI’ll do well enough. Do you hear?”\\n\\nRising, still with face averted, I proceeded to do what he asked. But in\\nanother moment seeing that he had been effectually bound and gagged,\\nI took out the piece of red chalk I had kept in my pocket, and\\ndeliberately chalked it on again, after which operation I came back and\\ntook my seat as before on the low stool by the window.\\n\\nThe object now was to secure the second rascal in the same way we had\\nthe first; and for this purpose Mr. Gryce ordered the now helpless giant\\nto be dragged into the adjoining small room formerly occupied by Mrs.\\nBlake, where he and his men likewise took up their station leaving me\\nto confront as best I might, the surprise and consternation of the one\\nwhose return we now awaited.\\n\\nI did not shrink. With that brave woman’s garments drawn about me,\\nsomething of her dauntless spirit seemed to invade my soul, and though I\\nexpected--But let that come in its place, I am not here to interest you\\nin myself or my selfish thoughts.\\n\\nA half hour passed; he had never lingered away so long before, or so it\\nseemed, and I was beginning to wonder if we should have to keep up this\\nstrain of nerve for hours, when the heavy tread was again heard in\\nthe hall, and with a blow of the fist that argued anger or a brutal\\nimpatience, he flung open the door and came in, I did not turn my head.\\n\\n“Where’s father?” he growled, stopping where he was a foot or so from\\nthe door.\\n\\nI shook my head with a slight gesture and remained looking out.\\n\\nHe brought his cane down on the floor with a thump. “What do you mean by\\nsitting there staring out of the window like mad and not answering when\\nI ask you a decent question?”\\n\\nStill I made no reply.\\n\\nProvoked beyond endurance, yet held in check by that vague sense of\\ndanger in the air,--which while not amounting to apprehension is often\\nsufficient to hold back from advance the most daring foot,--he stood\\nglaring at me in what I felt to be a very ferocious attitude, but made\\nno offer to move. Instantly I rose and still looking out of the window,\\nmade with my hand what appeared to be a signal to some one on the\\nopposite side of the way. The ruse was effective. With an oath that\\nrings in my ears yet, he lifted his heavy cane and advanced upon me with\\na bound, only to meet the same fate as his father at the hands of the\\nwatchful detectives. Not, however, before that heavy cane came down upon\\nmy head in a way to lay me in a heap at his feet and to sow the seeds\\nof that blinding head-ache, which has afflicted me by spells ever since.\\nBut this termination of the affair was no more than I had feared from\\nthe beginning; and indeed it was as much to protect Mrs. Blake from\\nthe wrath of these men, as from any requirements of the situation I had\\nassumed the disguise I then wore. I therefore did not allow this mishap\\nto greatly trouble me, unpleasant as it was at the time, but, as soon\\nas ever I could do so, rose from the floor and throwing off my strange\\nhabiliments, proceeded to finish up to my satisfaction, the work already\\nso successfully begun.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII. LOVE AND DUTY\\n\\n\\nDismissing the men who had assisted us in the capture of these two hardy\\nvillains, we ranged our prisoners before us.\\n\\n“Now,” said Mr. Gryce, “no fuss and no swearing; you are in for it, and\\nyou might as well take it quietly as any other way.”\\n\\n“Give me a clutch on that girl, that’s all,” said her father, “Where is\\nshe? Let me see her; every father has a right to see his own daughter,”\\n\\n“You shall see her,” returned my superior, “but not till her husband is\\nhere to protect her.”\\n\\n“Her husband? ah, you know about that do you?” growled the heavy voice\\nof the son. “A rich man they say he is and a proud one. Let him come\\nand look at us lying here like dogs and say how he will enjoy having his\\nwife’s father and brother grinding away their lives in prison.”\\n\\n“Mr. Blake is coming,” quoth Mr. Gryce, who by some preconcerted signal\\nfrom the window had drawn that gentleman across the street. “He will\\ntell you himself that he considers prison the best place for you. Blast\\nyou! but he--”\\n\\n“But he, what?” inquired I, as the door opened and Mr. Blake with a pale\\nface and agitated mien entered the room.\\n\\nThe wretch did not answer. Rousing from the cowering position in which\\nthey had both lain since their capture, the father and son struggled\\nup in some sort of measure to their feet, and with hot, anxious eyes\\nsurveyed the countenance of the gentleman before them, as if they felt\\ntheir fate hung upon the expression of his pallid face. The son was the\\nfirst to speak.\\n\\n“How do you do, brother-in-law,” were his sullen and insulting words.\\n\\nMr. Blake shuddered and cast a look around.\\n\\n“My wife?” murmured he.\\n\\n“She is well,” was the assurance given by Mr. Gryce, “and in a room not\\nfar from this. I will send for her if you say so.”\\n\\n“No, not yet,” came in a sort of gasp; “let me look at these wretches\\nfirst, and understand if I can what my wife has to suffer from her\\nconnection with them.”\\n\\n“Your wife,” broke in the father, “what’s that to do with it; the\\nquestion is how do you like it and what will you do to get us clear of\\nthis thing.”\\n\\n“I will do nothing,” returned Mr. Blake. “You amply merit your doom and\\nyou shall suffer it to the end for all time.”\\n\\n“It will read well in the papers,” exclaimed the son.\\n\\n“The papers are to know nothing about it,” I broke in. “All knowledge\\nof your connection with Mr. or Mrs. Blake is to be buried in this spot\\nbefore we or you leave it. Not a word of her or him is to cross the lips\\nof either of you from this hour. I have set that down as a condition and\\nit has got to be kept.”\\n\\n“You have, have you,” thundered in chorus from father and son. “And who\\nare you to make conditions, and what do you think we are that you expect\\nus to keep them? Can you do anymore than put us back from where we came\\nfrom?”\\n\\nFor reply I took from my pocket the ring I had fished out of the ashes\\nof their kitchen stove on that memorable visit to their house, and\\nholding it up before their faces, looked them steadily in the eye.\\n\\nA sudden wild glare followed by a bluish palor that robbed their\\ncountenances of their usual semblance of daring ferocity, answered me\\nbeyond my fondest hopes.\\n\\n“I got that out of the stove where you had burned your prison clothing,”\\n said I. “It is a cheap affair, but it will send you to the gallows if I\\nchoose to use it against you. The pedlar--”\\n\\n“Hush,” exclaimed the father in a low choked tone greatly in contrast to\\nany he had yet used in all our dealings with him. “Throw that ring out\\nof the window and I promise to hold my tongue about any matter you don’t\\nwant spoke of. I’m not a fool--”\\n\\n“Nor I,” was my quick reply, as I restored the ring to my pocket. “While\\nthat remains in my possession together with certain facts concerning\\nyour habits in that old house of yours which have lately been made known\\nto me, your life hangs by a thread I can any minute snip in two. Mr.\\nBlake here, has spent some portion of a night in your house and knows\\nhow near it lies to a certain precipice, at foot of which--”\\n\\n“Mein Gott, father, why don’t you say something!” leaped in cowed\\naccents from the son’s white lips. “If they want us to keep quiet, let\\nthem say so and not go talking about things that--”\\n\\n“Now look here,” interposed Mr. Gryce stepping before them with a look\\nthat closed their mouths at once. “I will just tell you what we propose\\nto do. You are to go back to prison and serve your time out, there is\\nno help for that, but as long as you behave yourselves and continue\\nabsolutely silent regarding your relationship to the wife of this\\ngentleman, you shall have paid into a certain bank that he will name,\\na monthly sum that upon your dismissal from jail shall be paid you with\\nwhatever interest it may have accumulated. You are ready to promise\\nthat, are you not?” he inquired turning to Mr. Blake.\\n\\nThat gentleman bowed and named the sum, which was liberal enough, and\\nthe bank.\\n\\n“But,” continued the detective, ignoring the sudden flash of eye that\\npassed between the father and son, “let me or any of us hear of a word\\nhaving been uttered by you, which in the remotest way shall suggest that\\nyou have in the world such a connection as Mrs. Blake, and the money not\\nonly stops going into the bank, but old scores shall be raked up against\\nyou with a zeal which if it does not stop your mouth in one way, will in\\nanother, and that with a suddenness you will not altogether relish.”\\n\\nThe men with a dogged air from which the bravado had however fled,\\nturned and looked from one to the other of us in a fearful, inquiring\\nway that duly confessed to the force of the impression made by these\\nwords upon their slow but not unimaginative minds.\\n\\n“Do you three promise to keep our secret if we keep yours?” muttered the\\nfather with an uneasy glance at my pocket.\\n\\n“We certainly do,” was our solemn return.\\n\\n“Very well; call in the girl and let me just look at her, then, before\\nwe go. We won’t say nothing,” continued he, seeing Mr. Blake shrink,\\n“only she is my daughter and if I cannot bid her good-bye--”\\n\\n“Let him see his child,” cried Mr. Blake turning with a shudder to the\\nwindow. “I--I wish it,” added he.\\n\\nStraightway with hasty foot I left the room. Going to the little closet\\nwhere I had ordered his wife to remain concealed, I knocked and entered.\\nShe was crouched in an attitude of prayer on the floor, her face buried\\nin her hands, and her whole person breathing that agony of suspense that\\nis a torture to the sensitive soul.\\n\\n“Mrs. Blake,” said I, dismissing the landlady who stood in helpless\\ndistress beside her, “the arrest has been satisfactorily made and your\\nfather calls for you to say good-bye before going away with us. Will you\\ncome?”\\n\\n“But my--my--Mr. Blake?” exclaimed she leaping to her feet. “I am sure I\\nheard his footstep in the hall?”\\n\\n“He is with your father and brother. It was at his command I came for\\nyou.”\\n\\nA gleam hard to interpret flashed for an instant over her face. With\\nher eye on the door she towered in her womanly dignity, while thoughts\\ninnumerable seemed to rush in wild succession through her mind.\\n\\n“Will you not come?” I urged.\\n\\n“I--,” she paused. “I will go see my father,” she murmured, “but--”\\n\\nSuddenly she trembled and drew back; a step was in the hall, on the\\nthreshold, at her side; Mr. Blake had come to reclaim his bride.\\n\\n“Mr. Blake!”\\n\\nThe word came from her in a low tone shaken with the concentrated\\nanguish of many a month of longing and despair, but there was no\\ninvitation in its sound, and he who had held out his arms, stopped and\\nsurveying her with a certain deprecatory glance in his proud eye, said,\\n\\n“You are right; I have first my acknowledgments to make and your\\nforgiveness to ask before I can hope--”\\n\\n“No, no,” she broke in, “your coming here is enough, I request no more.\\nIf you felt unkindly toward me--”\\n\\n“Unkindly?” A world of love thrilled in that word. “Luttra, I am your\\nhusband and rejoice that I am so; it is to lay the devotion of my heart\\nand life at your feet that I seek your presence this hour. The year has\\ntaught me--ah, what has not the year taught me of the worth of her I so\\nrecklessly threw from me on my wedding day. Luttra,”--he held out his\\nhand--“will you crown all your other acts of devotion with a pardon\\nthat will restore me to my manhood and that place in your esteem which I\\ncovet above every other earthly good?”\\n\\nHer face which had been raised to his with that earnest look we knew so\\nwell, softened with an ineffable smile, but still she did not lay her\\nhand in his.\\n\\n“And you say this to me in the very hour of my father’s and brother’s\\narrest! With the remembrance in your mind of their bound and abject\\nforms lying before you guarded by police; knowing too, that they deserve\\ntheir ignominy and the long imprisonment that awaits them?”\\n\\n“No, I say it on the day of the discovery and the restoration of that\\nwife for whom I have long searched, and to whom when found I have no\\nword to give but welcome, welcome, welcome.”\\n\\nWith the same deep smile she bowed her head, “Now let come what will,\\nI can never again be unhappy,” were the words I caught, uttered in the\\nlowest of undertones. But in another moment her head had regained its\\nsteady poise and a great change had passed over her manner.\\n\\n“Mr. Blake,” said she, “you are good; how good, I alone can know and\\nduly appreciate who have lived in your house this last year and seen\\nwith eyes that missed nothing, just what your surroundings are and have\\nbeen from the earliest years of your proud life. But goodness must not\\nlead you into the committal of an act you must and will repent to your\\ndying day; or if it does, I who have learned my duty in the school of\\nadversity, must show the courage of two and forbid what every secret\\ninstinct of my soul declares to be only provocative of shame and sorrow.\\nYou would take me to your heart as your wife; do you realize what that\\nmeans?”\\n\\n“I think I do,” was his earnest reply. “Relief from heart-ache, Luttra.”\\n\\nHer smooth brow wrinkled with a sudden spasm of pain but her firm lips\\ndid not quiver.\\n\\n“It means,” said she, drawing nearer but not with that approach which\\nindicates yielding, “it means, shame to the proudest family that lives\\nin the land. It means silence as regards a past blotted by suggestions\\nof crime; and apprehension concerning a future across which the shadow\\nof prison walls must for so many years lie. It means, the hushing of\\ncertain words upon beloved lips; the turning of cherished eyes from\\nvisions where fathers and daughters ay, brothers and sisters are\\nseen joined together in tender companionship or loving embrace. It\\nmeans,--God help me to speak out--a home without the sanctity of\\nmemories; a husband without the honors he has been accustomed to enjoy;\\na wife with a fear gnawing like a serpent into her breast; and children,\\nyes, perhaps children from whose innocent lips the sacred word of\\ngrandfather can never fall without wakening a blush on the cheeks of\\ntheir parents, which all their lovesome prattle will be helpless to\\nchase away.”\\n\\n“Luttra, your father and your brother have given their consent to go\\ntheir dark way alone and trouble you no more. The shadow you speak of\\nmay lie on your heart, dear wife, for these men are of your own blood,\\nbut it need never invade the hearthstone beside which I ask you to sit.\\nThe world will never know, whether you come with me or not, that\\nLuttra Blake was ever Luttra Schoenmaker. Will you not then give me the\\nhappiness of striving to make such amends for the past, that you too,\\nwill forget you ever bore any other name than the one you now honor so\\ntruly?”\\n\\n“O do not,” she began but paused with a sudden control of her emotion\\nthat lifted her into an atmosphere almost holy in its significance. “Mr.\\nBlake,” said she, “I am a woman and therefore weak to the voice of love\\npleading in my ear. But in one thing I am strong, and that is in my\\nsense of what is due to the man I have sworn to honor. Eleven months ago\\nI left you because your pleasure and my own dignity demanded it; to-day\\nI put by all the joy and exaltation you offer, because your position as\\na gentleman, and your happiness as a man equally requires it.”\\n\\n“My happiness as a man!” he broke in. “Ah, Luttra if you love me as I do\\nyou--”\\n\\n“I might perhaps yield,” she allowed with a faint smile. “But I love\\nyou as a girl brought up amid surroundings from which her whole being\\nrecoiled, must love the one who first brought light into her darkness\\nand opened up to her longing feet the way to a life of culture, purity\\nand honor. I were the basest of women could I consent to repay such a\\nboundless favor--”\\n\\n“But Luttra,” he again broke in, “you married me knowing what your\\nfather and brother were capable of committing.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes; I was blinded by passion, a girl’s passion, Mr. Blake, born\\nof glamour and gratitude; not the self-forgetting devotion of a woman\\nwho has tasted the bitterness of life and so learned its lesson of\\nsacrifice. I may not have thought, certainly I did not realize, what I\\nwas doing. Besides, my father and brother were not convicted criminals\\nat that time, however weak they had proved themselves under temptation.\\nAnd then I believed I had left them behind me on the road of life; that\\nwe were sundered, irrevocably cut loose from all possible connection.\\nBut such ties are not to be snapped so easily. They found me, you see,\\nand they will find me again--”\\n\\n“Never!” exclaimed her husband. “They are as dead to you as if the grave\\nhad swallowed them. I have taken care of that.”\\n\\n“But the shame! you have not taken care of that. That exists and must,\\nand while it does I remain where I can meet it alone. I love you; God’s\\nsun is not dearer to my eyes; but I will never cross your threshold as\\nyour wife till the opprobrium can be cut loose from my skirts, and the\\nshadow uplifted from my brow. A queen with high thoughts in her eyes and\\nbrave hopes in her heart were not too good to enter that door with you.\\nShall a girl who has lived three weeks in an atmosphere of such crime\\nand despair, that these rooms have often seemed to me the gateway to\\nhell, carry there, even in secrecy, the effects of that atmosphere? I\\nwill cherish your goodness in my heart but do not ask me to bury that\\nheart in any more exalted spot, than some humble country home, where\\nmy life may be spent in good deeds and my love in prayers for the man I\\nhold dear, and because I hold dear, leave to his own high path among the\\nstraight and unshadowed courses of the world.”\\n\\nAnd with a gesture that inexorably shut him off while it expressed the\\nmost touching appeal, she glided by him and took her way to the room\\nwhere her father and brother awaited her presence.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX. EXPLANATIONS\\n\\n\\n“I cannot endure this,” came in one burst of feeling from the lips of\\nMr. Blake. “She don’t know, she don’t realize--Sir,” cried he, suddenly\\nbecoming conscious of my presence in the room, “will you be good enough\\nto see that this note,” he hastily scribbled one, “is carried across the\\nway to my house and given to Mrs. Daniels.”\\n\\nI bowed assent, routed up one of the men in the next room and despatched\\nit at once.\\n\\n“Perhaps she will listen to the voice of one of her own sex if not to\\nme,” said he; and began pacing the floor of the narrow room in which we\\nwere, with a wildness of impatience that showed to what depths had sunk\\nthe hope of gaining this lovely woman for his own.\\n\\nFeeling myself no longer necessary in that spot, I followed where my\\nwishes led and entered the room where Luttra was bidding good-bye to her\\nfather.\\n\\n“I shall never forget,” I heard her say as I crossed the floor to where\\nMr. Gryce stood looking out of the window, “that your blood runs in my\\nveins together with that of my gentle-hearted, never-to-be-forgotten\\nmother. Whatever my fate may be or wherever I may hide the head you have\\nbowed to the dust, be sure I shall always lift up my hands in prayer for\\nyour repentance and return to an honest life. God grant that my prayers\\nmay be heard and that I may yet receive at your hands, a father’s kindly\\nblessing.”\\n\\nThe only answer to this was a heavily muttered growl that gave but\\nlittle promise of any such peaceful termination to a deeply vicious\\nlife. Hearing it, Mr. Gryce hastened to procure his men and remove the\\nhardened wretches from the spot. All through the preparations for their\\ndeparture, she stood and watched their sullen faces with a wild yearning\\nin her eye that could scarcely be denied, but when the door finally\\nclosed upon them, and she was left standing there with no one in the\\nroom but myself she steadied herself up as one who is conscious that all\\nthe storms of heaven are about to break upon her; and turning slowly\\nto the door waited with arms crossed and a still determination upon her\\nbrow, the coming of the feet of him whose resolve she felt must have, as\\nyet been only strengthened by her resistance.\\n\\nShe had not long to wait. Almost with the closing of the street door\\nupon the detectives and their prisoners, Mr. Blake followed by Mrs.\\nDaniels and another lady whose thick veil and long cloak but illy\\nconcealed the patrician features and stately form of the Countess De\\nMirac, entered the room.\\n\\nThe surprise had its effect; Luttra was evidently for the moment thrown\\noff her guard.\\n\\n“Mrs. Daniels!” she breathed, holding out her hands with a longing\\ngesture.\\n\\n“My dear mistress!” returned that good woman, taking those hands in hers\\nbut in a respectful way that proved the constraint imposed upon her by\\nMr. Blake’s presence. “Do I see you again and safe?”\\n\\n“You must have thought I cared little for the anxiety you would be sure\\nto feel,” said that fair young mistress, gazing with earnestness into\\nthe glad but tearful eyes of the housekeeper. “But indeed, I have\\nbeen in no position to communicate with you, nor could I do so without\\nrisking that to protect which I so outraged my feelings as to leave the\\nhouse at all. I mean the life and welfare of its master, Mrs. Daniels.”\\n\\n“Ha, what is that?” quoth Mr. Blake. “It was to save me, you consented\\nto follow them?”\\n\\n“Yes; what else would have led me to such an action? They might have\\nkilled me, I would not have cared, but when they began to utter threats\\nagainst you--”\\n\\n“Mrs. Blake,” exclaimed Mrs. Daniels, catching hold of her mistress’s\\nuplifted hand, and pointing to a scar that slightly disfigured her white\\narm a little above the wrist, “Mrs. Blake, what’s that?”\\n\\nA pink flush, the first I had seen on her usually pale countenance, rose\\nfor an instant to her cheeks, and she seemed to hesitate.\\n\\n“It was not there when I last saw you, Mrs. Blake.”\\n\\n“No,” was the slow reply, “I found myself forced that night to inflict\\nupon myself a little wound. It is nothing, let it go.”\\n\\n“No, Luttra I cannot let it go,” said her husband, advancing towards her\\nwith something like gentle command. “I must hear not only about this but\\nall the other occurrences of that night. How came they to find you in\\nthe refuge you had attained?”\\n\\n“I think,” said she in a low tone the underlying suffering of which\\nit would be hard to describe, “that it was not to seek me they first\\ninvaded your house. They had heard you were a rich man, and the sight\\nof that ladder running up the side of the new extension was too much for\\nthem. Indeed I know that it was for purposes of robbery they came, for\\nthey had hired this room opposite you some days previous to making the\\nattempt. You see they were almost destitute of money and though they had\\nsome buried in the cellar of the old house in Vermont, they dared not\\nleave the city to procure it. My brother was obliged to do so later,\\nhowever. It was a surprise to them seeing me in your house. They had\\nreached the roof of the extension and were just lifting up the corner of\\nthe shade I had dropped across the open window--I always open my window\\na few minutes before preparing to retire--when I rose from the chair in\\nwhich I had been brooding, and turned up the gas. I was combing my hair\\nat the time and so of course they recognized me. Instantly they gave\\na secret signal I, alas, remembered only too well, and crouching back,\\nbade me put out the light that they might enter with safety. I was at\\nfirst too much startled to realize the consequences of my action, and\\nwith some vague idea that they had discovered my retreat and come for\\npurposes of advice or assistance, I did what they bid. Immediately they\\nthrew back the shade and came in, their huge figures looming frightfully\\nin the faint light made by a distant gas lamp in the street below.\\n‘What do you want?’ were my first words uttered in a voice I scarcely\\nrecognized for my own; ‘why do you steal on me like this in the night\\nand through an open window fifty feet from the ground? Aren’t you afraid\\nyou will be discovered and sent back to the prison from which you have\\nescaped?’ Their reply sent a chill through my blood and awoke me to a\\nrealization of what I had done in thus allowing two escaped convicts\\nto enter a house not my own. ‘We want money and we’re not afraid of\\nanything now you are here.’ And without heeding my exclamation of\\nhorror, they coolly told me that they would wait where they were till\\nthe household was asleep, when they would expect me to show them the way\\nto the silver closet or what was better, the safe or wherever it was Mr.\\nBlake kept his money. I saw they took me for a servant, as indeed I was,\\nand for some minutes I managed to preserve that position in their eyes.\\nBut when in a sudden burst of rage at my refusal to help them, they\\npushed me aside and hurried to the door with the manifest intention of\\ngoing below, I forgot prudence in my fears and uttered some wild\\nappeal to them not to do injury to any one in the house for it was my\\nhusband’s. Of course that disclosure had its natural effect.\\n\\n“They stopped, but only to beset me with questions till the whole truth\\ncame out. I could not have committed a worse folly than thus taking them\\ninto my confidence. Instantly the advantages to be gained by using my\\nsecret connection with so wealthy a man for the purpose of cowering me\\nand blackmailing him, seemed to strike both their minds at once, slow\\nas they usually are to receive impressions. The silver-closet and\\nmoney-safe sank to a comparatively insignificant position in their eyes,\\nand to get me out of the house, and with my happiness at stake, treat\\nwith the honorable man who notwithstanding his non-approval of me as a\\nwoman, still regarded me as his lawfully wedded wife, became in their\\neyes a thing of such wonderful promise they were willing to run any and\\nevery risk to test its value. But here to their great astonishment\\nI rebelled; astonishment because they could not realize my desiring\\nanything above money and the position to which they declared I was by\\nlaw entitled. In vain I pleaded my love; in vain I threatened exposure\\nof their plans if not whereabouts. The mine of gold which they fondly\\nbelieved they had stumbled upon unawares, promised too richly to be\\neasily abandoned. ‘You must go with us,’ said they, ‘if not peaceably\\nthen by force,’ and they actually advanced upon me, upsetting a chair\\nand tearing down one of the curtains to which I clung. It was then I\\ncommitted that little act concerning which you questioned me. I wanted\\nto show them I was not to be moved by threats of that character; that I\\ndid not even fear the shedding of my blood; and that they would only be\\nwasting their time in trying to sway me by hints of personal violence.\\nAnd they were a little impressed, sufficiently so at least to turn their\\nthreats in another direction, awakening fears at last which I could not\\nconceal, much as I felt it would be policy to do so. Gathering up a few\\narticles I most prized, my wedding ring, Mr. Blake, and a photograph of\\nyourself that Mrs. Daniels had been kind enough to give me, I put on my\\nbonnet and cloak and said I would go with them, since they persisted in\\nrequiring it. The fact is I no longer possessed motive or strength\\nto resist. Even your unexpected appearance at the door, Mrs. Daniels,\\noffered no prospect of hope. Arouse the house? what would that do?\\nonly reveal my cherished secret and perhaps jeopardize the life of my\\nhusband. Besides, they were my own near kin, remember, and so had some\\nlittle claim upon my consideration, at least to the point of my not\\npersonally betraying them unless they menaced immediate and actual harm.\\nThe escape by the window which would have been a difficult task for most\\nwomen to perform, was easy enough for me. I was brought up to wild\\nways you know, and the descent of a ladder forty feet long was a\\ncomparatively trivial thing for me to accomplish. It was the tearing\\naway from a life of silent peace, the reentrance of my soul into an\\natmosphere of sin and deadly plotting, that was the hard thing, the\\ndifficult dreadful thing which hung weights to my feet, and made me\\nwell nigh mad. And it was this which at the sight of a policeman in the\\nstreet led me to make an effort to escape. But it was not successful.\\nThough I was fortunate enough to free myself from the grasp of my father\\nand brother, I reached the gate on ----- street only to encounter the\\neyes of him whose displeasure I most feared, looking sternly upon me\\nfrom the other side. The shock was too much for me in my then weak and\\nunnerved condition. Without considering anything but the fact that he\\nnever had known and never must, that I had been in the same house with\\nhim for so long, I rushed back to the corner and into the arms of the\\nmen who awaited me. How you came to be there, Mr. Blake, or why you did\\nnot open the gate and follow, I cannot say.”\\n\\n“The gate was locked,” returned that gentleman. “You remember it closes\\nwith a spring, and can only be opened by means of a key which I did not\\nhave.”\\n\\n“My father had it,” she murmured; “he spent a whole week in the endeavor\\nto get hold of it, and finally succeeded on the evening of the very day\\nhe used it. It was left in the lock I believe.”\\n\\n“So much for servants,” I whispered to myself.\\n\\n“The next morning,” continued she, “they put the case very plainly\\nbefore me. I was at liberty to return at once to my home if I would\\npromise to work in their interest by making certain demands upon you as\\nyour wife. All they wanted, said they, was a snug little sum and a lift\\nout of the country. If I would secure them these, they would trouble me\\nno more. But I could not concede to anything of that nature, of course,\\nand the consequence was these long weeks of imprisonment and suspense;\\nweeks that I do not now begrudge, seeing they have brought me the\\nassurance of your esteem and the knowledge, that wherever I go, your\\nthoughts will follow me with compassion if not with love.”\\n\\nAnd having told her story and thus answered his demands, she assumed\\nonce more the position of lofty reserve that seemed to shut him back\\nfrom advance like a wall of invincible crystal.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX. THE BOND THAT UNITES\\n\\n\\nBut he was not to be discouraged. “And after all this, after all you\\nhave suffered for my sake and your own, do you think you have a right to\\ndeny me the one desire of my heart? How can you reconcile it with your\\nideas of devotion, Luttra?”\\n\\n“My ideas of devotion look beyond the present, Mr. Blake. It is to save\\nyou from years of wearing anxiety that I consent to the infliction upon\\nyou of a passing pang.”\\n\\nHe took a bold step forward. “Luttra, you do not know a man’s heart. To\\nlose you now would not merely inflict a passing pang, but sow the seeds\\nof a grief that would go with me to the grave.”\\n\\n“Do you then”--she began, but paused blushing. Mrs. Daniels took the\\nopportunity to approach her on the other side.\\n\\n“My dear mistress,” said she, “you are wrong to hold out in this\\nmatter.” And her manner betrayed something of the peculiar agitation\\nthat had belonged to it in the former times of her secret embarassment.\\n“I, who have honored the family which I have so long served, above every\\nother in the land, tell you that you can do it no greater good than\\nto join it now, or inflict upon it any greater harm than to wilfully\\nwithdraw yourself from the position in which God has placed you.”\\n\\n“And I,” said another voice, that of the Countess de Mirac, who up to\\nthis time had held herself in the background, but who now came forward\\nand took her place with the rest, “I, who have borne the name of Blake,\\nand who am still the proudest of them all at heart, I, the Countess de\\nMirac, cousin to your husband there, repeat what this good woman has\\nsaid, and in holding out my hand to you, ask you to make my cousin happy\\nand his family contented by assuming that position in his household\\nwhich the law as well as his love accords you.”\\n\\nThe girl looked at the daintily gloved hand held out to her, colored\\nfaintly, and put her own within it.\\n\\n“I thank you for your goodness,” said she, surveying with half-sad,\\nhalf-admiring glances, the somewhat pale face of the beautiful brunette.\\n\\n“And you will yield to our united requests?” She cast her eye down at\\nthe spot where her father and brother had cowered in their shackles, and\\nshook her head. “I dare not,” said she.\\n\\nImmediately Mrs. Daniels, whose emotion had been increasing every moment\\nsince she last spoke, plunged her hand into her bosom and drew out a\\nfolded paper.\\n\\n“Mrs. Blake,” said she, “if you could be convinced that what I have told\\nyou was true, and that you would be irretrievably injuring your husband\\nand his interests, by persisting in that desertion of him which you\\npurpose, would you not consent to reconsider your determination, settled\\nas it appears to be?”\\n\\n“If I could be made to see that, most certainly,” returned she in a low\\nvoice whose broken accents betrayed at what cost she remained true to\\nher resolve. “But I cannot.”\\n\\n“Perhaps the sight of this paper will help you,” said she. And turning\\nto Mr. Blake she exclaimed, “Your pardon for what I am called upon to\\ndo. A duty has been laid upon me which I cannot avoid, hard as it is for\\nan old servant to perform. This paper--but it is no more than just that\\nyou, sir, should see and read it first.” And with a hand that quivered\\nwith fear or some equally strong emotion, she put it in his clasp.\\n\\nThe exclamation that rewarded the act made us all start forward. “My\\nfather’s handwriting!” were his words.\\n\\n“Executed under my eye,” observed Mrs. Daniels.\\n\\nHis glance ran rapidly down the sheet and rested upon the final\\nsignature.\\n\\n“Why has this been kept from me?” demanded he, turning upon Mrs. Daniels\\nwith sternness.\\n\\n“Your father so willed it,” was her reply. “‘For a year’ was his\\ncommand, ‘you shall keep this my last will and testament which I give\\ninto your care with my dying hands, a secret from the world. At the\\nexpiration of that time mark if my son’s wife sits at the head of her\\nhusband’s table; if she does and is happy, suppress this by deliberately\\ngiving it to the flames, but if from any reason other than death, she is\\nnot seen there, carry it at once to my son, and bid him as he honors\\nmy memory, to see that my wishes as there expressed are at once carried\\nout.’”\\n\\nThe paper in Mr. Blake’s hand fluttered.\\n\\n“You are aware what those wishes are?” said he.\\n\\n“I steadied his hand while he wrote,” was her sad and earnest reply.\\n\\nMr. Blake turned with a look of inexpressible deference to his wife.\\n\\n“Madame,” said he “when I urged you with such warmth to join your\\nfate to mine and honor my house by presiding over it, I thought I was\\ninviting you to share the advantages of wealth as well as the love of\\na lonely man’s heart. This paper undeceives me. Luttra, the\\ndaughter-in-law of Abner Blake, not Holman, his son, is the one who\\nby the inheritance of his millions has the right to command in this\\npresence.”\\n\\nWith a cry she took from him the will whose purport was thus briefly\\nmade known. “O, how could he, how could he?” exclaimed she, running her\\neye down the sheet, and then crushing it spasmodically to her breast.\\n“Did he not realize that he could do me no greater wrong?” Then in one\\nyielding up of her whole womanhood to the mighty burst of passion that\\nhad been flooding the defenses of her heart for so long, she exclaimed\\nin a voice the mingled rapture and determination of which rings in my\\nears even now, “And is it a thing like this with its suggestions of\\nmercenary interest that shall bridge the gulf that separates you and me?\\nShall the giving or the gaining of a fortune make necessary the unital\\nof lives over which holier influences have beamed and loftier hopes\\nshone? No, no; by the smile with which your dying father took me to his\\nbreast, love alone, with the hope and confidence it gives, shall be the\\nbond to draw us together and make of the two separate planes on which we\\nstand, a common ground where we can meet and be happy.”\\n\\nAnd with one supreme gesture she tore into pieces the will which she\\nheld, and sank all aglow with woman’s divinest joy into the arms held\\nout to receive her.\\n\\n                           * * * * *\\n\\nI was present at the wedding-reception given them by the Countess De\\nMirac in her elegant apartments at the Windsor. I never saw a happier\\nbride, nor a husband in whose eyes burned a deeper contentment. To all\\nquestions as to who this extraordinary woman could be, where she was\\nfound, and in what place and at what time she was married, the Countess\\nhad apt replies whose art of hushing curiosity without absolutely\\nsatisfying it, was one of the tokens she yet preserved, of her short\\nsway as grand lady, in the gayest and most hollow city of the world.\\n\\nAs I prepared to leave a scene perhaps the most gratifying in many\\nrespects that I had ever witnessed, I felt a slight touch on my arm. It\\ncame from Mrs. Blake who with her husband had crossed the room to bid me\\nfarewell.\\n\\n“Will you allow me to thank you,” said she, “for the risk you ran for\\nme one day and of which I have just heard. It was an act that merits the\\ngratitude of years, and as such shall be always remembered by me. If\\nthe old French artist with the racking cough ever desires a favor at my\\nhands, let him feel free to ask it. The interest I experienced in him in\\nthe days of my trouble, will suffer no abatement in these of my joy and\\nprosperity.” And with a look that was more than words, she gave me a\\nflower from the bouquet she held in her hand, and smilingly withdrew.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'PART I.\\n\\n(_Being a reprint from the reminiscences of_ JOHN H. WATSON, M.D., _late\\nof the Army Medical Department._) [2]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\\n\\n\\nIN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\\nI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\nentered upon my new duties.\\n\\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\\n\\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\\nemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\\nin sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\\ntroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\\nmy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\\ngovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\\n\\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\nair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\\na private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\\nI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\\n\\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\\na pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\\nbeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\\nand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\\nexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\\nwe started off together in a hansom.\\n\\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\\n\\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\\nby the time that we reached our destination.\\n\\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\\n\\n“Looking for lodgings.” [3] I answered. “Trying to solve the problem\\nas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\\nprice.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man\\nto-day that has used that expression to me.”\\n\\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\\n\\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\\nwere too much for his purse.”\\n\\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner\\nto being alone.”\\n\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\\nfor him as a constant companion.”\\n\\n“Why, what is there against him?”\\n\\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\\nin his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\\n\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\n\\n“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\\nknowledge which would astonish his professors.”\\n\\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\\n\\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\\n\\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\\n\\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\\nchannels.\\n\\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\\n\\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\\nthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\\nresponsible.”\\n\\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you\\nhave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s\\ntemper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”\\n\\n“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a laugh.\\n“Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to\\ncold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of\\nthe latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand,\\nbut simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea\\nof the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself\\nwith the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and\\nexact knowledge.”\\n\\n“Very right too.”\\n\\n“Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\\nrather a bizarre shape.”\\n\\n“Beating the subjects!”\\n\\n“Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him\\nat it with my own eyes.”\\n\\n“And yet you say he is not a medical student?”\\n\\n“No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we\\nare, and you must form your own impressions about him.” As he spoke, we\\nturned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which\\nopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,\\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed\\nwall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\\n\\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve\\nfound it,” he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\\ntest-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is precipitated\\nby hoemoglobin, [4] and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold mine,\\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.\\n\\n“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.\\n\\n“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength\\nfor which I should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in\\nAfghanistan, I perceive.”\\n\\n“How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment.\\n\\n“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “The question now is about\\nhoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\\nmine?”\\n\\n“It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “but\\npractically----”\\n\\n“Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\\nDon’t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come\\nover here now!” He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and\\ndrew me over to the table at which he had been working. “Let us have\\nsome fresh blood,” he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and\\ndrawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. “Now, I\\nadd this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that\\nthe resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion\\nof blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however,\\nthat we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.” As he\\nspoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added\\nsome drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a\\ndull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom\\nof the glass jar.\\n\\n“Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\\nchild with a new toy. “What do you think of that?”\\n\\n“It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.\\n\\n“Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears\\nto act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been\\ninvented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long\\nago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”\\n\\n“Indeed!” I murmured.\\n\\n“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them.\\nAre they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains,\\nor what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert,\\nand why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock\\nHolmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”\\n\\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\\nimagination.\\n\\n“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at his\\nenthusiasm.\\n\\n“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\\ncertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was\\nMason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier,\\nand Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it\\nwould have been decisive.”\\n\\n“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a\\nlaugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police News\\nof the Past.’”\\n\\n“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock\\nHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.\\n“I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for I\\ndabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke, and\\nI noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster,\\nand discoloured with strong acids.\\n\\n“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high\\nthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with\\nhis foot. “My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\\ncomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought\\nthat I had better bring you together.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with\\nme. “I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would\\nsuit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco,\\nI hope?”\\n\\n“I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.\\n\\n“That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally\\ndo experiments. Would that annoy you?”\\n\\n“By no means.”\\n\\n“Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\\ntimes, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am\\nsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What\\nhave you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the\\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.”\\n\\nI laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and\\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts\\nof ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices\\nwhen I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present.”\\n\\n“Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?” he asked,\\nanxiously.\\n\\n“It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well-played violin is a treat\\nfor the gods--a badly-played one----”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may\\nconsider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“When shall we see them?”\\n\\n“Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle\\neverything,” he answered.\\n\\n“All right--noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.\\n\\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\\nmy hotel.\\n\\n“By the way,” I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, “how\\nthe deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”\\n\\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his little\\npeculiarity,” he said. “A good many people have wanted to know how he\\nfinds things out.”\\n\\n“Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very piquant.\\nI am much obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper study of\\nmankind is man,’ you know.”\\n\\n“You must study him, then,” Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\\n“You’ll find him a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns more\\nabout you than you about him. Good-bye.”\\n\\n“Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\\ninterested in my new acquaintance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.\\n\\n\\nWE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B,\\n[5] Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large\\nairy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.\\nThat very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\\nfollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\\nportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we\\ngradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\\nsurroundings.\\n\\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet\\nin his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be\\nup after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical\\nlaboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long\\nwalks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.\\nNothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but\\nnow and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would\\nlie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving\\na muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such\\na dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him\\nof being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance\\nand cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\\n\\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded;\\nand his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of\\nalertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness\\nwhich mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably\\nblotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of\\nextraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe\\nwhen I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.\\n\\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured\\nto break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention.\\nMy health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was\\nexceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and\\nbreak the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I\\neagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and\\nspent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\\n\\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\\nconfirmed Stamford’s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable,\\nand within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample\\nand minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man\\nwould work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some\\ndefinite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the\\nexactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters\\nunless he has some very good reason for doing so.\\n\\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.\\nUpon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he\\nmight be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however,\\nwhen I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory\\nand of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human\\nbeing in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth\\ntravelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact\\nthat I could hardly realize it.\\n\\n“You appear to be astonished,” he said, smiling at my expression of\\nsurprise. “Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.”\\n\\n“To forget it!”\\n\\n“You see,” he explained, “I consider that a man’s brain originally is\\nlike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture\\nas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he\\ncomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets\\ncrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that\\nhe has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman\\nis very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will\\nhave nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of\\nthese he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It\\nis a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can\\ndistend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every\\naddition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is\\nof the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing\\nout the useful ones.”\\n\\n“But the Solar System!” I protested.\\n\\n“What the deuce is it to me?” he interrupted impatiently; “you say\\nthat we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a\\npennyworth of difference to me or to my work.”\\n\\nI was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something\\nin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I\\npondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw\\nmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which\\ndid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he\\npossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\\nmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\\nexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.\\nI could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran\\nin this way--\\n\\n\\nSHERLOCK HOLMES--his limits.\\n\\n  1. Knowledge of Literature.--Nil.\\n  2.              Philosophy.--Nil.\\n  3.              Astronomy.--Nil.\\n  4.              Politics.--Feeble.\\n  5.              Botany.--Variable.  Well up in belladonna,\\n                              opium, and poisons generally.\\n                              Knows nothing of practical gardening.\\n  6.              Geology.--Practical, but limited.\\n                               Tells at a glance different soils\\n                               from each other.  After walks has\\n                               shown me splashes upon his trousers,\\n                               and told me by their colour and\\n                               consistence in what part of London\\n                               he had received them.\\n  7.              Chemistry.--Profound.\\n  8.              Anatomy.--Accurate, but unsystematic.\\n  9.              Sensational Literature.--Immense.  He appears\\n                              to know every detail of every horror\\n                              perpetrated in the century.\\n  10. Plays the violin well.\\n  11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\\n  12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\\n\\n\\nWhen I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\\n“If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\\nthese accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,”\\n I said to myself, “I may as well give up the attempt at once.”\\n\\nI see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\\nwere very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments.\\nThat he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because\\nat my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn’s Lieder, and other\\nfavourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any\\nmusic or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of\\nan evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle\\nwhich was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and\\nmelancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they\\nreflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided\\nthose thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim\\nor fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against\\nthese exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them\\nby playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a\\nslight compensation for the trial upon my patience.\\n\\nDuring the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think\\nthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most\\ndifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,\\ndark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came\\nthree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,\\nfashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same\\nafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew\\npedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely\\nfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on\\nanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these\\nnondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to\\nbeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.\\nHe always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. “I have\\nto use this room as a place of business,” he said, “and these people\\nare my clients.” Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank\\nquestion, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to\\nconfide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for\\nnot alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to\\nthe subject of his own accord.\\n\\nIt was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\\nrose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not\\nyet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my\\nlate habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With\\nthe unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt\\nintimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table\\nand attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched\\nsilently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the\\nheading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.\\n\\nIts somewhat ambitious title was “The Book of Life,” and it attempted to\\nshow how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic\\nexamination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a\\nremarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was\\nclose and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched\\nand exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch\\nof a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man’s inmost thoughts.\\nDeceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one\\ntrained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible\\nas so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear\\nto the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had\\narrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.\\n\\n“From a drop of water,” said the writer, “a logician could infer the\\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\\none or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\\nknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\\nthe Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\\nby long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal\\nto attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to\\nthose moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest\\ndifficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary\\nproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to\\ndistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to\\nwhich he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the\\nfaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look\\nfor. By a man’s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his\\ntrouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his\\nexpression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man’s calling\\nis plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the\\ncompetent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.”\\n\\n“What ineffable twaddle!” I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\\ntable, “I never read such rubbish in my life.”\\n\\n“What is it?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“Why, this article,” I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat\\ndown to my breakfast. “I see that you have read it since you have marked\\nit. I don’t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It\\nis evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these\\nneat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not\\npractical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class\\ncarriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his\\nfellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.”\\n\\n“You would lose your money,” Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. “As for\\nthe article I wrote it myself.”\\n\\n“You!”\\n\\n“Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\\ntheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\\nchimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend\\nupon them for my bread and cheese.”\\n\\n“And how?” I asked involuntarily.\\n\\n“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\\nworld. I’m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\\nHere in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private\\nones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to\\nput them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I\\nam generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of\\ncrime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about\\nmisdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger\\nends, it is odd if you can’t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade\\nis a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a\\nforgery case, and that was what brought him here.”\\n\\n“And these other people?”\\n\\n“They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are\\nall people who are in trouble about something, and want a little\\nenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\\nthen I pocket my fee.”\\n\\n“But do you mean to say,” I said, “that without leaving your room you\\ncan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they\\nhave seen every detail for themselves?”\\n\\n“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\\nturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and\\nsee things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge\\nwhich I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.\\nThose rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your\\nscorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is\\nsecond nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our\\nfirst meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.”\\n\\n“You were told, no doubt.”\\n\\n“Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long\\nhabit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\\narrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps.\\nThere were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, ‘Here is a\\ngentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly\\nan army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is\\ndark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are\\nfair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says\\nclearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and\\nunnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have\\nseen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.’ The\\nwhole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you\\ncame from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.”\\n\\n“It is simple enough as you explain it,” I said, smiling. “You remind\\nme of Edgar Allen Poe’s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did\\nexist outside of stories.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. “No doubt you think that you are\\ncomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,” he observed. “Now, in my\\nopinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking\\nin on his friends’ thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of\\nan hour’s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some\\nanalytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as\\nPoe appeared to imagine.”\\n\\n“Have you read Gaboriau’s works?” I asked. “Does Lecoq come up to your\\nidea of a detective?”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. “Lecoq was a miserable bungler,”\\n he said, in an angry voice; “he had only one thing to recommend him, and\\nthat was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was\\nhow to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four\\nhours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for\\ndetectives to teach them what to avoid.”\\n\\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\\nlooking out into the busy street. “This fellow may be very clever,” I\\nsaid to myself, “but he is certainly very conceited.”\\n\\n“There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,” he said,\\nquerulously. “What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know\\nwell that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has\\never lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy\\nwith a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see\\nthrough it.”\\n\\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it\\nbest to change the topic.\\n\\n“I wonder what that fellow is looking for?” I asked, pointing to a\\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had\\na large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\\nmessage.\\n\\n“You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,” said Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“Brag and bounce!” thought I to myself. “He knows that I cannot verify\\nhis guess.”\\n\\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\\nthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps\\nascending the stair.\\n\\n“For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said, stepping into the room and handing\\nmy friend the letter.\\n\\nHere was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little\\nthought of this when he made that random shot. “May I ask, my lad,” I\\nsaid, in the blandest voice, “what your trade may be?”\\n\\n“Commissionaire, sir,” he said, gruffly. “Uniform away for repairs.”\\n\\n“And you were?” I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my\\ncompanion.\\n\\n“A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,\\nsir.”\\n\\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was\\ngone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. THE LAURISTON GARDEN MYSTERY [6]\\n\\n\\nI CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the\\npractical nature of my companion’s theories. My respect for his powers\\nof analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking\\nsuspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged\\nepisode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have\\nin taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he\\nhad finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,\\nlack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.\\n\\n“How in the world did you deduce that?” I asked.\\n\\n“Deduce what?” said he, petulantly.\\n\\n“Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.”\\n\\n“I have no time for trifles,” he answered, brusquely; then with a smile,\\n“Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps\\nit is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a\\nsergeant of Marines?”\\n\\n“No, indeed.”\\n\\n“It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you\\nwere asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some\\ndifficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the\\nstreet I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the\\nfellow’s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,\\nhowever, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was\\na man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.\\nYou must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung\\nhis cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of\\nhim--all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.”\\n\\n“Wonderful!” I ejaculated.\\n\\n“Commonplace,” said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he\\nwas pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. “I said just now that\\nthere were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong--look at this!” He\\nthrew me over the note which the commissionaire had brought. [7]\\n\\n“Why,” I cried, as I cast my eye over it, “this is terrible!”\\n\\n“It does seem to be a little out of the common,” he remarked, calmly.\\n“Would you mind reading it to me aloud?”\\n\\nThis is the letter which I read to him----\\n\\n\\n“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--\\n\\n“There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens,\\noff the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in\\nthe morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something\\nwas amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare\\nof furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and\\nhaving cards in his pocket bearing the name of ‘Enoch J. Drebber,\\nCleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.’ There had been no robbery, nor is there any\\nevidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in\\nthe room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to\\nhow he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler.\\nIf you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find\\nme there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you.\\nIf you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would\\nesteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion.\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n“TOBIAS GREGSON.”\\n\\n\\n“Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,” my friend remarked;\\n“he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and\\nenergetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knives\\ninto one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional\\nbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put\\nupon the scent.”\\n\\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. “Surely there is\\nnot a moment to be lost,” I cried, “shall I go and order you a cab?”\\n\\n“I’m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy\\ndevil that ever stood in shoe leather--that is, when the fit is on me,\\nfor I can be spry enough at times.”\\n\\n“Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the\\nwhole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will\\npocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.”\\n\\n“But he begs you to help him.”\\n\\n“Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but\\nhe would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.\\nHowever, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my\\nown hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!”\\n\\nHe hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that\\nan energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\\n\\n“Get your hat,” he said.\\n\\n“You wish me to come?”\\n\\n“Yes, if you have nothing better to do.” A minute later we were both in\\na hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\\n\\nIt was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the\\nhouse-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets\\nbeneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\\nabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and\\nan Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\\nmelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\\n\\n“You don’t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,” I said at\\nlast, interrupting Holmes’ musical disquisition.\\n\\n“No data yet,” he answered. “It is a capital mistake to theorize before\\nyou have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.”\\n\\n“You will have your data soon,” I remarked, pointing with my finger;\\n“this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much\\nmistaken.”\\n\\n“So it is. Stop, driver, stop!” We were still a hundred yards or so from\\nit, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon\\nfoot.\\n\\nNumber 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was\\none of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being\\noccupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant\\nmelancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and\\nthere a “To Let” card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared\\npanes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly\\nplants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed\\nby a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a\\nmixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the\\nrain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a\\nthree-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and\\nagainst this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by\\na small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes\\nin the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.\\n\\nI had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\\nhouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\\nfurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\\ncircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\\nopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\\nhe proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\\nwhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\\nhe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation\\nof satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey\\nsoil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was\\nunable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.\\nStill I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his\\nperceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal\\nwhich was hidden from me.\\n\\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\\nflaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\\nwrung my companion’s hand with effusion. “It is indeed kind of you to\\ncome,” he said, “I have had everything left untouched.”\\n\\n“Except that!” my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. “If a herd\\nof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\\ndoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\\npermitted this.”\\n\\n“I have had so much to do inside the house,” the detective said\\nevasively. “My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him\\nto look after this.”\\n\\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. “With two\\nsuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\\nmuch for a third party to find out,” he said.\\n\\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. “I think we have done\\nall that can be done,” he answered; “it’s a queer case though, and I\\nknew your taste for such things.”\\n\\n“You did not come here in a cab?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Nor Lestrade?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Then let us go and look at the room.” With which inconsequent remark he\\nstrode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed\\nhis astonishment.\\n\\nA short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices.\\nTwo doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these\\nhad obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the\\ndining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had\\noccurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling\\nat my heart which the presence of death inspires.\\n\\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence\\nof all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\\nbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\\nOpposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\\nimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\\nred wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\\nhazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\\nintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.\\n\\nAll these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\\ncentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\\nthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\\nceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\\nage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\\na short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\\nand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar\\nand cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\\nbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\\nhis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a\\ngrievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\\nand as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\\nfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly\\nsimious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,\\nunnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has\\nit appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\\nLondon.\\n\\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and\\ngreeted my companion and myself.\\n\\n“This case will make a stir, sir,” he remarked. “It beats anything I\\nhave seen, and I am no chicken.”\\n\\n“There is no clue?” said Gregson.\\n\\n“None at all,” chimed in Lestrade.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\\nintently. “You are sure that there is no wound?” he asked, pointing to\\nnumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\\n\\n“Positive!” cried both detectives.\\n\\n“Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--[8]\\npresumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of\\nthe circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in\\nthe year ‘34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It\\nhas all been done before.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere,\\nfeeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same\\nfar-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was\\nthe examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness\\nwith which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man’s lips,\\nand then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.\\n\\n“He has not been moved at all?” he asked.\\n\\n“No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.”\\n\\n“You can take him to the mortuary now,” he said. “There is nothing more\\nto be learned.”\\n\\nGregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered\\nthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\\nhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\\nit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\\n\\n“There’s been a woman here,” he cried. “It’s a woman’s wedding-ring.”\\n\\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\\nround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\\nplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\\n\\n“This complicates matters,” said Gregson. “Heaven knows, they were\\ncomplicated enough before.”\\n\\n“You’re sure it doesn’t simplify them?” observed Holmes. “There’s\\nnothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\\npockets?”\\n\\n“We have it all here,” said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\\nupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. “A gold watch, No. 97163, by\\nBarraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring,\\nwith masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog’s head, with rubies as eyes.\\nRussian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland,\\ncorresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose\\nmoney to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of\\nBoccaccio’s ‘Decameron,’ with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the\\nfly-leaf. Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph\\nStangerson.”\\n\\n“At what address?”\\n\\n“American Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for. They are both\\nfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\\nboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to\\nreturn to New York.”\\n\\n“Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?”\\n\\n“I did it at once, sir,” said Gregson. “I have had advertisements\\nsent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\\nExchange, but he has not returned yet.”\\n\\n“Have you sent to Cleveland?”\\n\\n“We telegraphed this morning.”\\n\\n“How did you word your inquiries?”\\n\\n“We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\\nof any information which could help us.”\\n\\n“You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\\nbe crucial?”\\n\\n“I asked about Stangerson.”\\n\\n“Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears\\nto hinge? Will you not telegraph again?”\\n\\n“I have said all I have to say,” said Gregson, in an offended voice.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\\nsome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\\nwere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\\nrubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\\n\\n“Mr. Gregson,” he said, “I have just made a discovery of the highest\\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\\ncareful examination of the walls.”\\n\\nThe little man’s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in\\na state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\\ncolleague.\\n\\n“Come here,” he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\\nwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. “Now, stand\\nthere!”\\n\\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\\n\\n“Look at that!” he said, triumphantly.\\n\\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\\nparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\\nyellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\\nscrawled in blood-red letters a single word--\\n\\n                         RACHE.\\n\\n\\n“What do you think of that?” cried the detective, with the air of a\\nshowman exhibiting his show. “This was overlooked because it was in the\\ndarkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The\\nmurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\\nit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\\nanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\\nthat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\\nlit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of\\nthe wall.”\\n\\n“And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?” asked Gregson in a\\ndepreciatory voice.\\n\\n“Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\\nRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\\nmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\\nwoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It’s all very well for\\nyou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but\\nthe old hound is the best, when all is said and done.”\\n\\n“I really beg your pardon!” said my companion, who had ruffled the\\nlittle man’s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. “You\\ncertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\\nand, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other\\nparticipant in last night’s mystery. I have not had time to examine this\\nroom yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\\nglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\\nabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\\nlying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\\nhe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\\nhimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire\\nof exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\\nencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\\nof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\\nacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\\nresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\\nmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his\\ntape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place\\nhe gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor,\\nand packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass\\nthe word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most\\nminute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\\nreplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\\n\\n“They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,” he\\nremarked with a smile. “It’s a very bad definition, but it does apply to\\ndetective work.”\\n\\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres [9] of their amateur\\ncompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\\nSherlock Holmes’ smallest actions were all directed towards some\\ndefinite and practical end.\\n\\n“What do you think of it, sir?” they both asked.\\n\\n“It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\\nto help you,” remarked my friend. “You are doing so well now that it\\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.” There was a world of\\nsarcasm in his voice as he spoke. “If you will let me know how your\\ninvestigations go,” he continued, “I shall be happy to give you any help\\nI can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found\\nthe body. Can you give me his name and address?”\\n\\nLestrade glanced at his note-book. “John Rance,” he said. “He is off\\nduty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.”\\n\\nHolmes took a note of the address.\\n\\n“Come along, Doctor,” he said; “we shall go and look him up. I’ll tell\\nyou one thing which may help you in the case,” he continued, turning to\\nthe two detectives. “There has been murder done, and the murderer was a\\nman. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\\noff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the\\nfinger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a\\nfew indications, but they may assist you.”\\n\\nLestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\\n\\n“If this man was murdered, how was it done?” asked the former.\\n\\n“Poison,” said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. “One other thing,\\nLestrade,” he added, turning round at the door: “‘Rache,’ is the German\\nfor ‘revenge;’ so don’t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.”\\n\\nWith which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\\nopen-mouthed behind him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.\\n\\n\\nIT was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\\nHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\\nto the address given us by Lestrade.\\n\\n“There is nothing like first hand evidence,” he remarked; “as a matter\\nof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\\nwell learn all that is to be learned.”\\n\\n“You amaze me, Holmes,” said I. “Surely you are not as sure as you\\npretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.”\\n\\n“There’s no room for a mistake,” he answered. “The very first thing\\nwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with\\nits wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain\\nfor a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must\\nhave been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse’s\\nhoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than\\nthat of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab\\nwas there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the\\nmorning--I have Gregson’s word for that--it follows that it must have\\nbeen there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two\\nindividuals to the house.”\\n\\n“That seems simple enough,” said I; “but how about the other man’s\\nheight?”\\n\\n“Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\\nthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\\nthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s stride\\nboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\\nchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads\\nhim to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just\\nover six feet from the ground. It was child’s play.”\\n\\n“And his age?” I asked.\\n\\n“Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\\neffort, he can’t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\\nof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\\nPatent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\\nThere is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\\nlife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\\nadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?”\\n\\n“The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,” I suggested.\\n\\n“The writing on the wall was done with a man’s forefinger dipped in\\nblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man’s\\nnail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\\nIt was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only made by a\\nTrichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes--in fact, I\\nhave written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can\\ndistinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar\\nor of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective\\ndiffers from the Gregson and Lestrade type.”\\n\\n“And the florid face?” I asked.\\n\\n“Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\\nright. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.”\\n\\nI passed my hand over my brow. “My head is in a whirl,” I remarked; “the\\nmore one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two\\nmen--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has become of the\\ncabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison?\\nWhere did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer,\\nsince robbery had no part in it? How came the woman’s ring there? Above\\nall, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before\\ndecamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling\\nall these facts.”\\n\\nMy companion smiled approvingly.\\n\\n“You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,” he\\nsaid. “There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\\nmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade’s discovery it was simply\\na blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting\\nSocialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if\\nyou noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real\\nGerman invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely\\nsay that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who\\noverdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong\\nchannel. I’m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You\\nknow a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick,\\nand if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the\\nconclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.”\\n\\n“I shall never do that,” I answered; “you have brought detection as near\\nan exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.”\\n\\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way\\nin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive\\nto flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you one other thing,” he said. “Patent leathers [10] and\\nSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\\ntogether as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability.\\nWhen they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather,\\nPatent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\\ncould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\\ngrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his\\nstrides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt,\\ninto a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I’ve told you all I know myself\\nnow, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working\\nbasis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to\\nHalle’s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.”\\n\\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the\\ndingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.\\n“That’s Audley Court in there,” he said, pointing to a narrow slit in\\nthe line of dead-coloured brick. “You’ll find me here when you come\\nback.”\\n\\nAudley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us\\ninto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We\\npicked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of\\ndiscoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which\\nwas decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\\nengraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were\\nshown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\\n\\nHe appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in\\nhis slumbers. “I made my report at the office,” he said.\\n\\nHolmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it\\npensively. “We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own\\nlips,” he said.\\n\\n“I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,” the constable\\nanswered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\\n\\n“Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.”\\n\\nRance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\\ndetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.\\n\\n“I’ll tell it ye from the beginning,” he said. “My time is from ten at\\nnight to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the ‘White\\nHart’; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o’clock it\\nbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grove\\nbeat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin’.\\nPresently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take\\na look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\\nprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\\nthough a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin’ down, thinkin’\\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\\nsuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\\non account of him that owns them who won’t have the drains seen to,\\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o’ typhoid\\nfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in\\nthe window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the\\ndoor----”\\n\\n“You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,” my companion\\ninterrupted. “What did you do that for?”\\n\\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost\\namazement upon his features.\\n\\n“Why, that’s true, sir,” he said; “though how you come to know it,\\nHeaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and\\nso lonesome, that I thought I’d be none the worse for some one with me.\\nI ain’t afeared of anything on this side o’ the grave; but I thought\\nthat maybe it was him that died o’ the typhoid inspecting the drains\\nwhat killed him. The thought gave me a kind o’ turn, and I walked back\\nto the gate to see if I could see Murcher’s lantern, but there wasn’t no\\nsign of him nor of anyone else.”\\n\\n“There was no one in the street?”\\n\\n“Not a livin’ soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\\ntogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\\nso I went into the room where the light was a-burnin’. There was a\\ncandle flickerin’ on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I\\nsaw----”\\n\\n“Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,\\nand you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried\\nthe kitchen door, and then----”\\n\\nJohn Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\\nhis eyes. “Where was you hid to see all that?” he cried. “It seems to me\\nthat you knows a deal more than you should.”\\n\\nHolmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\\n“Don’t get arresting me for the murder,” he said. “I am one of the\\nhounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\\nthat. Go on, though. What did you do next?”\\n\\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression.\\n“I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher\\nand two more to the spot.”\\n\\n“Was the street empty then?”\\n\\n“Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nThe constable’s features broadened into a grin. “I’ve seen many a drunk\\nchap in my time,” he said, “but never anyone so cryin’ drunk as\\nthat cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin’ up agin the\\nrailings, and a-singin’ at the pitch o’ his lungs about Columbine’s\\nNew-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn’t stand, far less\\nhelp.”\\n\\n“What sort of a man was he?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\nJohn Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. “He was\\nan uncommon drunk sort o’ man,” he said. “He’d ha’ found hisself in the\\nstation if we hadn’t been so took up.”\\n\\n“His face--his dress--didn’t you notice them?” Holmes broke in\\nimpatiently.\\n\\n“I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up--me\\nand Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower\\npart muffled round----”\\n\\n“That will do,” cried Holmes. “What became of him?”\\n\\n“We’d enough to do without lookin’ after him,” the policeman said, in an\\naggrieved voice. “I’ll wager he found his way home all right.”\\n\\n“How was he dressed?”\\n\\n“A brown overcoat.”\\n\\n“Had he a whip in his hand?”\\n\\n“A whip--no.”\\n\\n“He must have left it behind,” muttered my companion. “You didn’t happen\\nto see or hear a cab after that?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“There’s a half-sovereign for you,” my companion said, standing up and\\ntaking his hat. “I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the\\nforce. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You\\nmight have gained your sergeant’s stripes last night. The man whom you\\nheld in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and\\nwhom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you\\nthat it is so. Come along, Doctor.”\\n\\nWe started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,\\nbut obviously uncomfortable.\\n\\n“The blundering fool,” Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\\nlodgings. “Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good\\nluck, and not taking advantage of it.”\\n\\n“I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this\\nman tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why\\nshould he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way\\nof criminals.”\\n\\n“The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no\\nother way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I\\nshall have him, Doctor--I’ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must\\nthank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have\\nmissed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh?\\nWhy shouldn’t we use a little art jargon. There’s the scarlet thread of\\nmurder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is\\nto unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now\\nfor lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing\\nare splendid. What’s that little thing of Chopin’s she plays so\\nmagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.”\\n\\nLeaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\\nlark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.\\n\\n\\nOUR morning’s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was\\ntired out in the afternoon. After Holmes’ departure for the concert, I\\nlay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours’ sleep.\\nIt was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\\nhad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into\\nit. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\\nbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\\nimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\\ndifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\\nCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\\ndepravity of the victim was no condonment [11] in the eyes of the law.\\n\\nThe more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion’s\\nhypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\\nhad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\\nwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what\\nhad caused the man’s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\\nstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so\\nthickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the\\nvictim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As\\nlong as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be\\nno easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident\\nmanner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained\\nall the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.\\n\\nHe was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert\\ncould not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before\\nhe appeared.\\n\\n“It was magnificent,” he said, as he took his seat. “Do you remember\\nwhat Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and\\nappreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of\\nspeech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced\\nby it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries\\nwhen the world was in its childhood.”\\n\\n“That’s rather a broad idea,” I remarked.\\n\\n“One’s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\\nNature,” he answered. “What’s the matter? You’re not looking quite\\nyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.”\\n\\n“To tell the truth, it has,” I said. “I ought to be more case-hardened\\nafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\\nMaiwand without losing my nerve.”\\n\\n“I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\\nseen the evening paper?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\\nfact that when the man was raised up, a woman’s wedding ring fell upon\\nthe floor. It is just as well it does not.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Look at this advertisement,” he answered. “I had one sent to every\\npaper this morning immediately after the affair.”\\n\\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It\\nwas the first announcement in the “Found” column. “In Brixton Road,\\nthis morning,” it ran, “a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\\nbetween the ‘White Hart’ Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,\\n221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.”\\n\\n“Excuse my using your name,” he said. “If I used my own some of these\\ndunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.”\\n\\n“That is all right,” I answered. “But supposing anyone applies, I have\\nno ring.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, you have,” said he, handing me one. “This will do very well. It\\nis almost a facsimile.”\\n\\n“And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.”\\n\\n“Why, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square toes.\\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.”\\n\\n“Would he not consider it as too dangerous?”\\n\\n“Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\\nto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the\\nring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber’s\\nbody, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he\\ndiscovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in\\npossession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had\\nto pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have\\nbeen aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that\\nman’s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him\\nthat it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving\\nthe house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the\\nevening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His\\neye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should\\nhe fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding\\nof the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will\\ncome. You shall see him within an hour?”\\n\\n“And then?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?”\\n\\n“I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.”\\n\\n“You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man,\\nand though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\\nanything.”\\n\\nI went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with\\nthe pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\\nfavourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\\n\\n“The plot thickens,” he said, as I entered; “I have just had an answer\\nto my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.”\\n\\n“And that is?” I asked eagerly.\\n\\n“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put your\\npistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary\\nway. Leave the rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at him too\\nhard.”\\n\\n“It is eight o’clock now,” I said, glancing at my watch.\\n\\n“Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly.\\nThat will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a\\nqueer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday--‘De Jure inter\\nGentes’--published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles’\\nhead was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed\\nvolume was struck off.”\\n\\n“Who is the printer?”\\n\\n“Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very\\nfaded ink, is written ‘Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.’ I wonder who William\\nWhyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His\\nwriting has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.”\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\\nsoftly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\\nservant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\\nopened it.\\n\\n“Does Dr. Watson live here?” asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\\ncould not hear the servant’s reply, but the door closed, and some one\\nbegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\\none. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\\nlistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble\\ntap at the door.\\n\\n“Come in,” I cried.\\n\\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very\\nold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be\\ndazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\\nstood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\\nwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\\nhad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to\\nkeep my countenance.\\n\\nThe old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\\nadvertisement. “It’s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,” she said,\\ndropping another curtsey; “a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It\\nbelongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth,\\nwhich her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he’d say if\\nhe come ‘ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, he\\nbeing short enough at the best o’ times, but more especially when he\\nhas the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night along\\nwith----”\\n\\n“Is that her ring?” I asked.\\n\\n“The Lord be thanked!” cried the old woman; “Sally will be a glad woman\\nthis night. That’s the ring.”\\n\\n“And what may your address be?” I inquired, taking up a pencil.\\n\\n“13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.”\\n\\n“The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,” said\\nSherlock Holmes sharply.\\n\\nThe old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little\\nred-rimmed eyes. “The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,” she said.\\n“Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.”\\n\\n“And your name is----?”\\n\\n“My name is Sawyer--her’s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her--and\\na smart, clean lad, too, as long as he’s at sea, and no steward in the\\ncompany more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what\\nwith liquor shops----”\\n\\n“Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,” I interrupted, in obedience to a sign\\nfrom my companion; “it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad\\nto be able to restore it to the rightful owner.”\\n\\nWith many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone\\npacked it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock\\nHolmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into\\nhis room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and\\na cravat. “I’ll follow her,” he said, hurriedly; “she must be an\\naccomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.” The hall door had\\nhardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair.\\nLooking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the\\nother side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.\\n“Either his whole theory is incorrect,” I thought to myself, “or else he\\nwill be led now to the heart of the mystery.” There was no need for him\\nto ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was impossible until\\nI heard the result of his adventure.\\n\\nIt was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might\\nbe, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages\\nof Henri Murger’s “Vie de Bohème.” Ten o’clock passed, and I heard the\\nfootsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the\\nmore stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same\\ndestination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of\\nhis latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not\\nbeen successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the\\nmastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a\\nhearty laugh.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,” he cried,\\ndropping into his chair; “I have chaffed them so much that they would\\nnever have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I\\nknow that I will be even with them in the long run.”\\n\\n“What is it then?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had\\ngone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being\\nfoot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which\\nwas passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but\\nI need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to\\nbe heard at the other side of the street, ‘Drive to 13, Duncan Street,\\nHoundsditch,’ she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and\\nhaving seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That’s an art\\nwhich every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and\\nnever drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off\\nbefore we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy,\\nlounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw\\nhim open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When\\nI reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and\\ngiving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I\\nlistened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it\\nwill be some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13\\nwe found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named\\nKeswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever\\nbeen heard of there.”\\n\\n“You don’t mean to say,” I cried, in amazement, “that that tottering,\\nfeeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,\\nwithout either you or the driver seeing her?”\\n\\n“Old woman be damned!” said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. “We were the old\\nwomen to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an\\nactive one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was\\ninimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means\\nof giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as\\nlonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk\\nsomething for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice\\nand turn in.”\\n\\nI was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I\\nleft Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the\\nwatches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin,\\nand knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he\\nhad set himself to unravel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.\\n\\n\\nTHE papers next day were full of the “Brixton Mystery,” as they termed\\nit. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it\\nin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I\\nstill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing\\nupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:--\\n\\nThe _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws,\\nand been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht,\\naqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian\\ntheory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the\\narticle concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer\\nwatch over foreigners in England.\\n\\nThe _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort\\nusually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the\\nunsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening\\nof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had\\nbeen residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the\\nboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.\\nHe was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph\\nStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the\\n4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of\\ncatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon\\nthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber’s body\\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,\\nmany miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are\\nquestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the\\nwhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and\\nMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it\\nis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\\nthrow light upon the matter.\\n\\nThe _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\\na political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated\\nthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores\\na number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not\\nsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these\\nmen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was\\npunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,\\nStangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the\\ndeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address\\nof the house at which he had boarded--a result which was entirely due to\\nthe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and\\nthey appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\\n\\n“I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure\\nto score.”\\n\\n“That depends on how it turns out.”\\n\\n“Oh, bless you, it doesn’t matter in the least. If the man is caught, it\\nwill be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be _in\\nspite_ of their exertions. It’s heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever\\nthey do, they will have followers. ‘Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot\\nqui l’admire.’”\\n\\n“What on earth is this?” I cried, for at this moment there came the\\npattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by\\naudible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.\\n\\n“It’s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,” said my\\ncompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a\\ndozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped\\neyes on.\\n\\n“‘Tention!” cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little\\nscoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. “In\\nfuture you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you\\nmust wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?”\\n\\n“No, sir, we hain’t,” said one of the youths.\\n\\n“I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are\\nyour wages.” [13] He handed each of them a shilling.\\n\\n“Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.”\\n\\nHe waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats,\\nand we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\\n\\n“There’s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than\\nout of a dozen of the force,” Holmes remarked. “The mere sight of an\\nofficial-looking person seals men’s lips. These youngsters, however, go\\neverywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all\\nthey want is organisation.”\\n\\n“Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?” I asked.\\n\\n“Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter\\nof time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!\\nHere is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every\\nfeature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he\\nis!”\\n\\nThere was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the\\nfair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and\\nburst into our sitting-room.\\n\\n“My dear fellow,” he cried, wringing Holmes’ unresponsive hand,\\n“congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.”\\n\\nA shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion’s expressive face.\\n\\n“Do you mean that you are on the right track?” he asked.\\n\\n“The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.”\\n\\n“And his name is?”\\n\\n“Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty’s navy,” cried\\nGregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\\n\\n“Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,” he said. “We are anxious to\\nknow how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?”\\n\\n“I don’t mind if I do,” the detective answered. “The tremendous\\nexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn\\nme out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon\\nthe mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both\\nbrain-workers.”\\n\\n“You do me too much honour,” said Holmes, gravely. “Let us hear how you\\narrived at this most gratifying result.”\\n\\nThe detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently\\nat his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of\\namusement.\\n\\n“The fun of it is,” he cried, “that that fool Lestrade, who thinks\\nhimself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is\\nafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\\nthan the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this\\ntime.”\\n\\nThe idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\\n\\n“And how did you get your clue?”\\n\\n“Ah, I’ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is\\nstrictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend\\nwith was the finding of this American’s antecedents. Some people would\\nhave waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties\\ncame forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson’s\\nway of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Holmes; “by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.”\\n\\nGregson looked quite crest-fallen.\\n\\n“I had no idea that you noticed that,” he said. “Have you been there?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Ha!” cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; “you should never neglect a\\nchance, however small it may seem.”\\n\\n“To a great mind, nothing is little,” remarked Holmes, sententiously.\\n\\n“Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that\\nsize and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.\\nHe had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier’s Boarding\\nEstablishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.”\\n\\n“Smart--very smart!” murmured Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“I next called upon Madame Charpentier,” continued the detective.\\n“I found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,\\ntoo--an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about\\nthe eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn’t escape\\nmy notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock\\nHolmes, when you come upon the right scent--a kind of thrill in your\\nnerves. ‘Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr.\\nEnoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?’ I asked.\\n\\n“The mother nodded. She didn’t seem able to get out a word. The daughter\\nburst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something\\nof the matter.\\n\\n“‘At what o’clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?’ I\\nasked.\\n\\n“‘At eight o’clock,’ she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\\nagitation. ‘His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two\\ntrains--one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first. [14]\\n\\n“‘And was that the last which you saw of him?’\\n\\n“A terrible change came over the woman’s face as I asked the question.\\nHer features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she\\ncould get out the single word ‘Yes’--and when it did come it was in a\\nhusky unnatural tone.\\n\\n“There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm\\nclear voice.\\n\\n“‘No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,’ she said. ‘Let us be\\nfrank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.’\\n\\n“‘God forgive you!’ cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and\\nsinking back in her chair. ‘You have murdered your brother.’\\n\\n“‘Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,’ the girl answered\\nfirmly.\\n\\n“‘You had best tell me all about it now,’ I said. ‘Half-confidences are\\nworse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.’\\n\\n“‘On your head be it, Alice!’ cried her mother; and then, turning to me,\\n‘I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf\\nof my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this\\nterrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however,\\nthat in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be\\ncompromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his\\nprofession, his antecedents would all forbid it.’\\n\\n“‘Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,’ I answered.\\n‘Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.’\\n\\n“‘Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,’ she said, and her\\ndaughter withdrew. ‘Now, sir,’ she continued, ‘I had no intention of\\ntelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I\\nhave no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all\\nwithout omitting any particular.’\\n\\n“‘It is your wisest course,’ said I.\\n\\n“‘Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary,\\nMr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a\\n“Copenhagen” label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been\\ntheir last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his\\nemployer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his\\nhabits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became\\nvery much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o’clock in the\\nday he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards the\\nmaid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he\\nspeedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke\\nto her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent\\nto understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and\\nembraced her--an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him\\nfor his unmanly conduct.’\\n\\n“‘But why did you stand all this,’ I asked. ‘I suppose that you can get\\nrid of your boarders when you wish.’\\n\\n“Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. ‘Would to God that\\nI had given him notice on the very day that he came,’ she said. ‘But\\nit was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each--fourteen\\npounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in\\nthe Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the\\nbest. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on\\naccount of it. That was the reason of his going.’\\n\\n“‘Well?’\\n\\n“‘My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed the\\ndoor behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in\\nless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.\\nDrebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for\\ndrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my\\ndaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train.\\nHe then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that\\nshe should fly with him. “You are of age,” he said, “and there is no law\\nto stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl\\nhere, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a\\nprincess.” Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him,\\nbut he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the\\ndoor. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room.\\nWhat happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds\\nof a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up\\nI saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand.\\n“I don’t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,” he said. “I will\\njust go after him and see what he does with himself.” With those words\\nhe took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we\\nheard of Mr. Drebber’s mysterious death.’\\n\\n“This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier’s lips with many gasps and\\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I\\nmade shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should\\nbe no possibility of a mistake.”\\n\\n“It’s quite exciting,” said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. “What happened\\nnext?”\\n\\n“When Mrs. Charpentier paused,” the detective continued, “I saw that the\\nwhole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which\\nI always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son\\nreturned.\\n\\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered.\\n\\n“‘Not know?’\\n\\n“‘No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.’\\n\\n“‘After you went to bed?’\\n\\n“‘Yes.’\\n\\n“‘When did you go to bed?’\\n\\n“‘About eleven.’\\n\\n“‘So your son was gone at least two hours?’\\n\\n“‘Yes.’\\n\\n“‘Possibly four or five?’\\n\\n“‘Yes.’\\n\\n“‘What was he doing during that time?’\\n\\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered, turning white to her very lips.\\n\\n“Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found\\nout where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and\\narrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come\\nquietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, ‘I suppose you\\nare arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel\\nDrebber,’ he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his\\nalluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.”\\n\\n“Very,” said Holmes.\\n\\n“He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as\\nhaving with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.”\\n\\n“What is your theory, then?”\\n\\n“Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road.\\nWhen there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of\\nwhich Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach,\\nperhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so\\nwet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim\\ninto the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing\\non the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the\\npolice on to the wrong scent.”\\n\\n“Well done!” said Holmes in an encouraging voice. “Really, Gregson, you\\nare getting along. We shall make something of you yet.”\\n\\n“I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,” the detective\\nanswered proudly. “The young man volunteered a statement, in which he\\nsaid that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him,\\nand took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an\\nold shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this\\nold shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I\\nthink the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is to\\nthink of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid\\nhe won’t make much of [15] Why, by Jove, here’s the very man himself!”\\n\\nIt was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were\\ntalking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness\\nwhich generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.\\nHis face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged\\nand untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting\\nwith Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be\\nembarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling\\nnervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. “This is a most\\nextraordinary case,” he said at last--“a most incomprehensible affair.”\\n\\n“Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!” cried Gregson, triumphantly. “I\\nthought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the\\nSecretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?”\\n\\n“The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,” said Lestrade gravely, “was\\nmurdered at Halliday’s Private Hotel about six o’clock this morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.\\n\\n\\nTHE intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so\\nunexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang\\nout of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I\\nstared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his\\nbrows drawn down over his eyes.\\n\\n“Stangerson too!” he muttered. “The plot thickens.”\\n\\n“It was quite thick enough before,” grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.\\n“I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.”\\n\\n“Are you--are you sure of this piece of intelligence?” stammered\\nGregson.\\n\\n“I have just come from his room,” said Lestrade. “I was the first to\\ndiscover what had occurred.”\\n\\n“We have been hearing Gregson’s view of the matter,” Holmes observed.\\n“Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?”\\n\\n“I have no objection,” Lestrade answered, seating himself. “I freely\\nconfess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in\\nthe death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was\\ncompletely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out\\nwhat had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston\\nStation about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the\\nmorning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which\\nconfronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between\\n8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards.\\nI telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning\\nthem to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling\\nupon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You\\nsee, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated,\\nthe natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the\\nvicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next\\nmorning.”\\n\\n“They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,”\\n remarked Holmes.\\n\\n“So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making\\nenquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and\\nat eight o’clock I reached Halliday’s Private Hotel, in Little George\\nStreet. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,\\nthey at once answered me in the affirmative.\\n\\n“‘No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,’ they said. ‘He\\nhas been waiting for a gentleman for two days.’\\n\\n“‘Where is he now?’ I asked.\\n\\n“‘He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.’\\n\\n“‘I will go up and see him at once,’ I said.\\n\\n“It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and\\nlead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me\\nthe room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor\\nleading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to\\ngo downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in\\nspite of my twenty years’ experience. From under the door there curled\\na little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and\\nformed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry,\\nwhich brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door\\nwas locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it\\nin. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled\\nup, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had\\nbeen for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned\\nhim over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman\\nwho had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause\\nof death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated\\nthe heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you\\nsuppose was above the murdered man?”\\n\\nI felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,\\neven before Sherlock Holmes answered.\\n\\n“The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,” he said.\\n\\n“That was it,” said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all\\nsilent for a while.\\n\\nThere was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the\\ndeeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to\\nhis crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle\\ntingled as I thought of it.\\n\\n“The man was seen,” continued Lestrade. “A milk boy, passing on his way\\nto the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews\\nat the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay\\nthere, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which\\nwas wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the\\nladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to\\nbe some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular\\nnotice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him\\nto be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish\\nface, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in\\nthe room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained\\nwater in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the\\nsheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.”\\n\\nI glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which\\ntallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of\\nexultation or satisfaction upon his face.\\n\\n“Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the\\nmurderer?” he asked.\\n\\n“Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber’s purse in his pocket, but it seems\\nthat this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd\\npounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these\\nextraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were\\nno papers or memoranda in the murdered man’s pocket, except a single\\ntelegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing\\nthe words, ‘J. H. is in Europe.’ There was no name appended to this\\nmessage.”\\n\\n“And there was nothing else?” Holmes asked.\\n\\n“Nothing of any importance. The man’s novel, with which he had read\\nhimself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair\\nbeside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the\\nwindow-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\\n\\n“The last link,” he cried, exultantly. “My case is complete.”\\n\\nThe two detectives stared at him in amazement.\\n\\n“I have now in my hands,” my companion said, confidently, “all the\\nthreads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details\\nto be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the\\ntime that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the\\ndiscovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own\\neyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand\\nupon those pills?”\\n\\n“I have them,” said Lestrade, producing a small white box; “I took them\\nand the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of\\nsafety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these\\npills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Give them here,” said Holmes. “Now, Doctor,” turning to me, “are those\\nordinary pills?”\\n\\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,\\nround, and almost transparent against the light. “From their lightness\\nand transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,” I\\nremarked.\\n\\n“Precisely so,” answered Holmes. “Now would you mind going down and\\nfetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long,\\nand which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.”\\n\\nI went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It’s laboured\\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.\\nIndeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded\\nthe usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the\\nrug.\\n\\n“I will now cut one of these pills in two,” said Holmes, and drawing his\\npenknife he suited the action to the word. “One half we return into the\\nbox for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass,\\nin which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the\\nDoctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.”\\n\\n“This may be very interesting,” said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\\none who suspects that he is being laughed at, “I cannot see, however,\\nwhat it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.”\\n\\n“Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\\neverything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\\nmixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps\\nit up readily enough.”\\n\\nAs he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and\\nplaced it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock\\nHolmes’ earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in\\nsilence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling\\neffect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched\\nupon tho [16] cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently\\nneither the better nor the worse for its draught.\\n\\nHolmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\\nresult, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared\\nupon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the\\ntable, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great\\nwas his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two\\ndetectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which\\nhe had met.\\n\\n“It can’t be a coincidence,” he cried, at last springing from his chair\\nand pacing wildly up and down the room; “it is impossible that it should\\nbe a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of\\nDrebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they\\nare inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot\\nhave been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the\\nworse. Ah, I have it! I have it!” With a perfect shriek of delight he\\nrushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk,\\nand presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature’s tongue\\nseemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive\\nshiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been\\nstruck by lightning.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his\\nforehead. “I should have more faith,” he said; “I ought to know by\\nthis time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of\\ndeductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other\\ninterpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly\\npoison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that\\nbefore ever I saw the box at all.”\\n\\nThis last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\\nhardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,\\nhowever, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me\\nthat the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began\\nto have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\\n\\n“All this seems strange to you,” continued Holmes, “because you failed\\nat the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single\\nreal clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize\\nupon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to\\nconfirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence\\nof it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more\\nobscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.\\nIt is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most\\ncommonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no\\nnew or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder\\nwould have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of\\nthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of\\nthose _outré_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered\\nit remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more\\ndifficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.”\\n\\nMr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\\nimpatience, could contain himself no longer. “Look here, Mr. Sherlock\\nHolmes,” he said, “we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart\\nman, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something\\nmore than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking\\nthe man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young\\nCharpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade\\nwent after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.\\nYou have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more\\nthan we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to\\nask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the\\nman who did it?”\\n\\n“I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,” remarked Lestrade.\\n“We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more\\nthan once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence\\nwhich you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.”\\n\\n“Any delay in arresting the assassin,” I observed, “might give him time\\nto perpetrate some fresh atrocity.”\\n\\nThus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\\ncontinued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest\\nand his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.\\n\\n“There will be no more murders,” he said at last, stopping abruptly and\\nfacing us. “You can put that consideration out of the question. You have\\nasked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of\\nhis name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying\\nour hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes\\nof managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which\\nneeds delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal\\nwith, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who\\nis as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone\\ncan have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the\\nslightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant\\namong the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning\\nto hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these\\nmen to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I\\nhave not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all\\nthe blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present\\nI am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you\\nwithout endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.”\\n\\nGregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance,\\nor by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had\\nflushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other’s beady eyes\\nglistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to\\nspeak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman\\nof the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant and\\nunsavoury person.\\n\\n“Please, sir,” he said, touching his forelock, “I have the cab\\ndownstairs.”\\n\\n“Good boy,” said Holmes, blandly. “Why don’t you introduce this pattern\\nat Scotland Yard?” he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from\\na drawer. “See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an\\ninstant.”\\n\\n“The old pattern is good enough,” remarked Lestrade, “if we can only\\nfind the man to put them on.”\\n\\n“Very good, very good,” said Holmes, smiling. “The cabman may as well\\nhelp me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.”\\n\\nI was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\\nto set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.\\nThere was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and\\nbegan to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the\\nroom.\\n\\n“Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,” he said, kneeling over\\nhis task, and never turning his head.\\n\\nThe fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\\ndown his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the\\njangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” he cried, with flashing eyes, “let me introduce you to Mr.\\nJefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.”\\n\\nThe whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no time\\nto realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes’\\ntriumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman’s\\ndazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had\\nappeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might\\nhave been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,\\nthe prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes’s grasp, and hurled\\nhimself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but\\nbefore he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon\\nhim like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then\\ncommenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that\\nthe four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the\\nconvulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands\\nwere terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of\\nblood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until\\nLestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and\\nhalf-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of\\nno avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his\\nfeet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and\\npanting.\\n\\n“We have his cab,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It will serve to take him to\\nScotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,” he continued, with a pleasant smile,\\n“we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome to\\nput any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I\\nwill refuse to answer them.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART II. _The Country of the Saints._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I. ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.\\n\\n\\nIN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies\\nan arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a\\nbarrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to\\nNebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado\\nupon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature\\nalways in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises\\nsnow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are\\nswift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons; and there are\\nenormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are\\ngrey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common\\ncharacteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.\\n\\nThere are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees\\nor of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\\nhunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight\\nof those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their\\nprairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily\\nthrough the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark\\nravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These\\nare the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\\n\\nIn the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from\\nthe northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\\nstretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\\nalkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On\\nthe extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,\\nwith their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of\\ncountry there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.\\nThere is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,\\ngrey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,\\nthere is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but\\nsilence--complete and heart-subduing silence.\\n\\nIt has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\\nplain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\\nsees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\\nlost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down\\nby the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered\\nwhite objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull\\ndeposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some\\nlarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have\\nbelonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one\\nmay trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those\\nwho had fallen by the wayside.\\n\\nLooking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\\neighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance\\nwas such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region.\\nAn observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer\\nto forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown\\nparchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his\\nlong, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his\\neyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while\\nthe hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a\\nskeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet\\nhis tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry\\nand vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes,\\nwhich hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it\\nwas that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was\\ndying--dying from hunger and from thirst.\\n\\nHe had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\\nelevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great\\nsalt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage\\nmountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might\\nindicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there\\nwas no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild\\nquestioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to\\nan end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. “Why\\nnot here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,” he muttered,\\nas he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\\n\\nBefore sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle,\\nand also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried\\nslung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for\\nhis strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some\\nlittle violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little\\nmoaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very\\nbright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.\\n\\n“You’ve hurt me!” said a childish voice reproachfully.\\n\\n“Have I though,” the man answered penitently, “I didn’t go for to do\\nit.” As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\\nlittle girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\\npink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother’s care. The\\nchild was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she\\nhad suffered less than her companion.\\n\\n“How is it now?” he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\\ntowsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\\n\\n“Kiss it and make it well,” she said, with perfect gravity, shoving\\n[19] the injured part up to him. “That’s what mother used to do. Where’s\\nmother?”\\n\\n“Mother’s gone. I guess you’ll see her before long.”\\n\\n“Gone, eh!” said the little girl. “Funny, she didn’t say good-bye; she\\n‘most always did if she was just goin’ over to Auntie’s for tea, and now\\nshe’s been away three days. Say, it’s awful dry, ain’t it? Ain’t there\\nno water, nor nothing to eat?”\\n\\n“No, there ain’t nothing, dearie. You’ll just need to be patient awhile,\\nand then you’ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and\\nthen you’ll feel bullier. It ain’t easy to talk when your lips is like\\nleather, but I guess I’d best let you know how the cards lie. What’s\\nthat you’ve got?”\\n\\n“Pretty things! fine things!” cried the little girl enthusiastically,\\nholding up two glittering fragments of mica. “When we goes back to home\\nI’ll give them to brother Bob.”\\n\\n“You’ll see prettier things than them soon,” said the man confidently.\\n“You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though--you remember when\\nwe left the river?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes.”\\n\\n“Well, we reckoned we’d strike another river soon, d’ye see. But there\\nwas somethin’ wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin’, and it didn’t\\nturn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you\\nand--and----”\\n\\n“And you couldn’t wash yourself,” interrupted his companion gravely,\\nstaring up at his grimy visage.\\n\\n“No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian\\nPete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,\\nyour mother.”\\n\\n“Then mother’s a deader too,” cried the little girl dropping her face in\\nher pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\\n\\n“Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\\nchance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and\\nwe tramped it together. It don’t seem as though we’ve improved matters.\\nThere’s an almighty small chance for us now!”\\n\\n“Do you mean that we are going to die too?” asked the child, checking\\nher sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\\n\\n“I guess that’s about the size of it.”\\n\\n“Why didn’t you say so before?” she said, laughing gleefully. “You gave\\nme such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we’ll be with\\nmother again.”\\n\\n“Yes, you will, dearie.”\\n\\n“And you too. I’ll tell her how awful good you’ve been. I’ll bet she\\nmeets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot\\nof buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was\\nfond of. How long will it be first?”\\n\\n“I don’t know--not very long.” The man’s eyes were fixed upon the\\nnorthern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared\\nthree little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did\\nthey approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown\\nbirds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then\\nsettled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the\\nvultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.\\n\\n“Cocks and hens,” cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their\\nill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. “Say, did\\nGod make this country?”\\n\\n“In course He did,” said her companion, rather startled by this\\nunexpected question.\\n\\n“He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,” the\\nlittle girl continued. “I guess somebody else made the country in these\\nparts. It’s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the\\ntrees.”\\n\\n“What would ye think of offering up prayer?” the man asked diffidently.\\n\\n“It ain’t night yet,” she answered.\\n\\n“It don’t matter. It ain’t quite regular, but He won’t mind that, you\\nbet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the\\nwaggon when we was on the Plains.”\\n\\n“Why don’t you say some yourself?” the child asked, with wondering eyes.\\n\\n“I disremember them,” he answered. “I hain’t said none since I was half\\nthe height o’ that gun. I guess it’s never too late. You say them out,\\nand I’ll stand by and come in on the choruses.”\\n\\n“Then you’ll need to kneel down, and me too,” she said, laying the shawl\\nout for that purpose. “You’ve got to put your hands up like this. It\\nmakes you feel kind o’ good.”\\n\\nIt was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see\\nit. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little\\nprattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face,\\nand his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless\\nheaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were\\nface to face, while the two voices--the one thin and clear, the other\\ndeep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The\\nprayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder\\nuntil the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her\\nprotector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved\\nto be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed\\nhimself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the\\ntired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the\\nman’s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion,\\nand both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.\\n\\nHad the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\\nwould have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali\\nplain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and\\nhardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually\\ngrowing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud.\\nThis cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it\\ncould only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more\\nfertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one\\nof those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was\\napproaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As\\nthe whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two\\ncastaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the\\nfigures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the\\napparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for\\nthe West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base\\nof the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right\\nacross the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons\\nand carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who\\nstaggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the\\nwaggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently\\nno ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had\\nbeen compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new\\ncountry. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and\\nrumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels\\nand the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to\\nrouse the two tired wayfarers above them.\\n\\nAt the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced\\nmen, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching\\nthe base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among\\nthemselves.\\n\\n“The wells are to the right, my brothers,” said one, a hard-lipped,\\nclean-shaven man with grizzly hair.\\n\\n“To the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio Grande,”\\n said another.\\n\\n“Fear not for water,” cried a third. “He who could draw it from the\\nrocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.”\\n\\n“Amen! Amen!” responded the whole party.\\n\\nThey were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\\nkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag\\nabove them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,\\nshowing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight\\nthere was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while\\nfresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word\\n‘Redskins’ was on every lip.\\n\\n“There can’t be any number of Injuns here,” said the elderly man who\\nappeared to be in command. “We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no\\nother tribes until we cross the great mountains.”\\n\\n“Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,” asked one of the band.\\n\\n“And I,” “and I,” cried a dozen voices.\\n\\n“Leave your horses below and we will await you here,” the Elder\\nanswered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their\\nhorses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the\\nobject which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and\\nnoiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts.\\nThe watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock\\nuntil their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who had\\nfirst given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him\\nthrow up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining\\nhim they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their\\neyes.\\n\\nOn the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a\\nsingle giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,\\nlong-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid\\nface and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him\\nlay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown\\nsinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his\\nvelveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of\\nsnow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile\\nfeatures. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and\\nneat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long\\nshrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this\\nstrange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of\\nthe new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped\\nsullenly away.\\n\\nThe cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about [20]\\nthem in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon\\nthe plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and\\nwhich was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His\\nface assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his\\nboney hand over his eyes. “This is what they call delirium, I guess,”\\n he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of\\nhis coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering\\nquestioning gaze of childhood.\\n\\nThe rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that\\ntheir appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl,\\nand hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt\\ncompanion, and assisted him towards the waggons.\\n\\n“My name is John Ferrier,” the wanderer explained; “me and that little\\nun are all that’s left o’ twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o’\\nthirst and hunger away down in the south.”\\n\\n“Is she your child?” asked someone.\\n\\n“I guess she is now,” the other cried, defiantly; “she’s mine ‘cause I\\nsaved her. No man will take her from me. She’s Lucy Ferrier from this\\nday on. Who are you, though?” he continued, glancing with curiosity at\\nhis stalwart, sunburned rescuers; “there seems to be a powerful lot of\\nye.”\\n\\n“Nigh upon ten thousand,” said one of the young men; “we are the\\npersecuted children of God--the chosen of the Angel Merona.”\\n\\n“I never heard tell on him,” said the wanderer. “He appears to have\\nchosen a fair crowd of ye.”\\n\\n“Do not jest at that which is sacred,” said the other sternly. “We are\\nof those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters\\non plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith\\nat Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we\\nhad founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent\\nman and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.”\\n\\nThe name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. “I\\nsee,” he said, “you are the Mormons.”\\n\\n“We are the Mormons,” answered his companions with one voice.\\n\\n“And where are you going?”\\n\\n“We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our\\nProphet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with\\nyou.”\\n\\nThey had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded\\nby crowds of the pilgrims--pale-faced meek-looking women, strong\\nlaughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries\\nof astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they\\nperceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the\\nother. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by\\na great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was\\nconspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of\\nits appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were\\nfurnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there\\nsat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but\\nwhose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He\\nwas reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid\\nit aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he\\nturned to the two castaways.\\n\\n“If we take you with us,” he said, in solemn words, “it can only be as\\nbelievers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better\\nfar that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you\\nshould prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the\\nwhole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?”\\n\\n“Guess I’ll come with you on any terms,” said Ferrier, with such\\nemphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader\\nalone retained his stern, impressive expression.\\n\\n“Take him, Brother Stangerson,” he said, “give him food and drink,\\nand the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy\\ncreed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!”\\n\\n“On, on to Zion!” cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down\\nthe long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a\\ndull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking\\nof wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan\\nwas winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs\\nhad been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already\\nawaiting them.\\n\\n“You shall remain here,” he said. “In a few days you will have recovered\\nfrom your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you\\nare of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with\\nthe voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. THE FLOWER OF UTAH.\\n\\n\\nTHIS is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured\\nby the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the\\nshores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains\\nthey had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history.\\nThe savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and\\ndisease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all\\nbeen overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the\\naccumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them.\\nThere was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer\\nwhen they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath\\nthem, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the\\npromised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for\\nevermore.\\n\\nYoung speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a\\nresolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future\\ncity was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in\\nproportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put\\nto his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and\\nsquares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining\\nand hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole\\ncountry golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange\\nsettlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the\\ncentre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of\\ndawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer\\nand the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the\\nimmigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.\\n\\nThe two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his\\nfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons\\nto the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne\\nalong pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson’s waggon, a retreat which\\nshe shared with the Mormon’s three wives and with his son, a headstrong\\nforward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood,\\nfrom the shock caused by her mother’s death, she soon became a pet\\nwith the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving\\ncanvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his\\nprivations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable\\nhunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that\\nwhen they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed\\nthat he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land\\nas any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of\\nStangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal\\nElders.\\n\\nOn the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial\\nlog-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it\\ngrew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind,\\nkeen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution\\nenabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his\\nlands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to\\nhim prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his\\nneighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve\\nthere were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could\\ncompare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch\\nMountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.\\n\\nThere was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities\\nof his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him\\nto set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He\\nnever gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by\\nresolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some\\nwho accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who\\nput it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others,\\nagain, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who\\nhad pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason,\\nFerrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed\\nto the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an\\northodox and straight-walking man.\\n\\nLucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted\\nfather in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the\\nbalsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to\\nthe young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,\\nher cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon\\nthe high road which ran by Ferrier’s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts\\nrevive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping\\nthrough the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father’s mustang,\\nand managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West.\\nSo the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father\\nthe richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American\\ngirlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.\\n\\nIt was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious\\nchange is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of\\nall does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the\\ntouch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,\\nwith a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has\\nawoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember\\nthe one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the\\ncase of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart\\nfrom its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides.\\n\\nIt was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as\\nthe bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and\\nin the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high\\nroads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the\\nwest, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland\\nRoute lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of\\nsheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains\\nof tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable\\njourney. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the\\nskill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair\\nface flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out\\nbehind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was\\ndashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness\\nof youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The\\ntravel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even\\nthe unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their\\naccustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced\\nmaiden.\\n\\nShe had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road\\nblocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking\\nherdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this\\nobstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely\\nhad she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind\\nher, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of\\nfierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with\\ncattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of\\nevery opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way\\nthrough the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures,\\neither by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of\\nthe mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon\\nits hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that\\nwould have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full\\nof peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns\\nagain, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could\\ndo to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death\\nunder the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to\\nsudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle\\nto relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the\\nstruggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair,\\nbut for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At\\nthe same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by\\nthe curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the\\noutskirts.\\n\\n“You’re not hurt, I hope, miss,” said her preserver, respectfully.\\n\\nShe looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. “I’m awful\\nfrightened,” she said, naively; “whoever would have thought that Poncho\\nwould have been so scared by a lot of cows?”\\n\\n“Thank God you kept your seat,” the other said earnestly. He was a tall,\\nsavage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and\\nclad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his\\nshoulders. “I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,” he remarked,\\n“I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he\\nremembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he’s the same Ferrier, my\\nfather and he were pretty thick.”\\n\\n“Hadn’t you better come and ask yourself?” she asked, demurely.\\n\\nThe young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes\\nsparkled with pleasure. “I’ll do so,” he said, “we’ve been in the\\nmountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting\\ncondition. He must take us as he finds us.”\\n\\n“He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,” she answered,\\n“he’s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he’d have never\\ngot over it.”\\n\\n“Neither would I,” said her companion.\\n\\n“You! Well, I don’t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow.\\nYou ain’t even a friend of ours.”\\n\\nThe young hunter’s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy\\nFerrier laughed aloud.\\n\\n“There, I didn’t mean that,” she said; “of course, you are a friend now.\\nYou must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won’t trust\\nme with his business any more. Good-bye!”\\n\\n“Good-bye,” he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over\\nher little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her\\nriding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of\\ndust.\\n\\nYoung Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.\\nHe and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver,\\nand were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital\\nenough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen\\nas any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn\\nhis thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl,\\nas frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic,\\nuntamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight,\\nhe realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver\\nspeculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to\\nhim as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in\\nhis heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the\\nwild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He\\nhad been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in\\nhis heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human\\nperseverance could render him successful.\\n\\nHe called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until\\nhis face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the\\nvalley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning\\nthe news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this\\nJefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested\\nLucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and\\ncould narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost\\nin those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a\\nsilver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be\\nhad, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a\\nfavourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On\\nsuch occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright,\\nhappy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer\\nher own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,\\nbut they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her\\naffections.\\n\\nIt was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled\\nup at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He\\nthrew the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\\n\\n“I am off, Lucy,” he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing\\ntenderly down into her face; “I won’t ask you to come with me now, but\\nwill you be ready to come when I am here again?”\\n\\n“And when will that be?” she asked, blushing and laughing.\\n\\n“A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my\\ndarling. There’s no one who can stand between us.”\\n\\n“And how about father?” she asked.\\n\\n“He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all\\nright. I have no fear on that head.”\\n\\n“Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there’s\\nno more to be said,” she whispered, with her cheek against his broad\\nbreast.\\n\\n“Thank God!” he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. “It is\\nsettled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are\\nwaiting for me at the cañon. Good-bye, my own darling--good-bye. In two\\nmonths you shall see me.”\\n\\nHe tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his\\nhorse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though\\nafraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at\\nwhat he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until\\nhe vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the\\nhappiest girl in all Utah.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.\\n\\n\\nTHREE weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had\\ndeparted from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier’s heart was sore within him\\nwhen he thought of the young man’s return, and of the impending loss of\\nhis adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to\\nthe arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always\\ndetermined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever\\ninduce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he\\nregarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever\\nhe might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was\\ninflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to\\nexpress an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in\\nthe Land of the Saints.\\n\\nYes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly dared\\nonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something\\nwhich fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a\\nswift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned\\npersecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most\\nterrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German\\nVehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put\\na more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over\\nthe State of Utah.\\n\\nIts invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made\\nthis organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\\nomnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\\nagainst the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or\\nwhat had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,\\nbut no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the\\nhands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed\\nby annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this\\nterrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men\\nwent about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the\\nwilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.\\n\\nAt first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards\\nto pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The\\nsupply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female\\npopulation on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange\\nrumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants and\\nrifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women\\nappeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and\\nbore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated\\nwanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,\\nstealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These\\ntales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\\nre-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\\nTo this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite\\nBand, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.\\n\\nFuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\\nresults served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\\ninspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\\nsociety. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\\nviolence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\\nThe very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\\nProphet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at\\nnight with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every\\nman feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\\nnearest his heart.\\n\\nOne fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,\\nwhen he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,\\nsaw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His\\nheart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham\\nYoung himself. Full of trepidation--for he knew that such a visit boded\\nhim little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The\\nlatter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with\\na stern face into the sitting-room.\\n\\n“Brother Ferrier,” he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly\\nfrom under his light-coloured eyelashes, “the true believers have been\\ngood friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the\\ndesert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,\\ngave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our\\nprotection. Is not this so?”\\n\\n“It is so,” answered John Ferrier.\\n\\n“In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you\\nshould embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.\\nThis you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have\\nneglected.”\\n\\n“And how have I neglected it?” asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in\\nexpostulation. “Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended\\nat the Temple? Have I not----?”\\n\\n“Where are your wives?” asked Young, looking round him. “Call them in,\\nthat I may greet them.”\\n\\n“It is true that I have not married,” Ferrier answered. “But women\\nwere few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a\\nlonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.”\\n\\n“It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,” said the leader\\nof the Mormons. “She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found\\nfavour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.”\\n\\nJohn Ferrier groaned internally.\\n\\n“There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve--stories that\\nshe is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.\\nWhat is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?\\n‘Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if\\nshe wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.’ This being so, it is\\nimpossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your\\ndaughter to violate it.”\\n\\nJohn Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his\\nriding-whip.\\n\\n“Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been\\ndecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would\\nnot have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all\\nchoice. We Elders have many heifers, [29] but our children must also\\nbe provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of\\nthem would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose\\nbetween them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say\\nyou to that?”\\n\\nFerrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\\n\\n“You will give us time,” he said at last. “My daughter is very\\nyoung--she is scarce of an age to marry.”\\n\\n“She shall have a month to choose,” said Young, rising from his seat.\\n“At the end of that time she shall give her answer.”\\n\\nHe was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and\\nflashing eyes. “It were better for you, John Ferrier,” he thundered,\\n“that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra\\nBlanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of\\nthe Holy Four!”\\n\\nWith a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and\\nFerrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\\n\\nHe was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he\\nshould broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon\\nhis, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her\\npale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.\\n\\n“I could not help it,” she said, in answer to his look. “His voice rang\\nthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?”\\n\\n“Don’t you scare yourself,” he answered, drawing her to him, and passing\\nhis broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. “We’ll fix it\\nup somehow or another. You don’t find your fancy kind o’ lessening for\\nthis chap, do you?”\\n\\nA sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.\\n\\n“No; of course not. I shouldn’t care to hear you say you did. He’s a\\nlikely lad, and he’s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in\\nspite o’ all their praying and preaching. There’s a party starting for\\nNevada to-morrow, and I’ll manage to send him a message letting him know\\nthe hole we are in. If I know anything o’ that young man, he’ll be back\\nhere with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.”\\n\\nLucy laughed through her tears at her father’s description.\\n\\n“When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that\\nI am frightened, dear. One hears--one hears such dreadful stories about\\nthose who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to\\nthem.”\\n\\n“But we haven’t opposed him yet,” her father answered. “It will be time\\nto look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at\\nthe end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.”\\n\\n“Leave Utah!”\\n\\n“That’s about the size of it.”\\n\\n“But the farm?”\\n\\n“We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell\\nthe truth, Lucy, it isn’t the first time I have thought of doing it. I\\ndon’t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their\\ndarned prophet. I’m a free-born American, and it’s all new to me. Guess\\nI’m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might\\nchance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite\\ndirection.”\\n\\n“But they won’t let us leave,” his daughter objected.\\n\\n“Wait till Jefferson comes, and we’ll soon manage that. In the meantime,\\ndon’t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don’t get your eyes swelled up,\\nelse he’ll be walking into me when he sees you. There’s nothing to be\\nafeared about, and there’s no danger at all.”\\n\\nJohn Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone,\\nbut she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the\\nfastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and\\nloaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. A FLIGHT FOR LIFE.\\n\\n\\nON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,\\nJohn Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his\\nacquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him\\nwith his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the\\nimminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he\\nshould return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned\\nhome with a lighter heart.\\n\\nAs he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\\neach of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering\\nto find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a\\nlong pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet\\ncocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse\\nbloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in\\nhis pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as\\nhe entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.\\n\\n“Maybe you don’t know us,” he said. “This here is the son of Elder\\nDrebber, and I’m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert\\nwhen the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true\\nfold.”\\n\\n“As He will all the nations in His own good time,” said the other in a\\nnasal voice; “He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.”\\n\\nJohn Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\\n\\n“We have come,” continued Stangerson, “at the advice of our fathers to\\nsolicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to\\nyou and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has\\nseven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.”\\n\\n“Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,” cried the other; “the question is not\\nhow many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\\ngiven over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.”\\n\\n“But my prospects are better,” said the other, warmly. “When the\\nLord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\\nfactory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.”\\n\\n“It will be for the maiden to decide,” rejoined young Drebber, smirking\\nat his own reflection in the glass. “We will leave it all to her\\ndecision.”\\n\\nDuring this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\\nhardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\\n\\n“Look here,” he said at last, striding up to them, “when my daughter\\nsummons you, you can come, but until then I don’t want to see your faces\\nagain.”\\n\\nThe two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this\\ncompetition between them for the maiden’s hand was the highest of\\nhonours both to her and her father.\\n\\n“There are two ways out of the room,” cried Ferrier; “there is the door,\\nand there is the window. Which do you care to use?”\\n\\nHis brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,\\nthat his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The\\nold farmer followed them to the door.\\n\\n“Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,” he said,\\nsardonically.\\n\\n“You shall smart for this!” Stangerson cried, white with rage. “You have\\ndefied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end\\nof your days.”\\n\\n“The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,” cried young Drebber; “He\\nwill arise and smite you!”\\n\\n“Then I’ll start the smiting,” exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would\\nhave rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and\\nrestrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses’\\nhoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\\n\\n“The young canting rascals!” he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from\\nhis forehead; “I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the\\nwife of either of them.”\\n\\n“And so should I, father,” she answered, with spirit; “but Jefferson\\nwill soon be here.”\\n\\n“Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we\\ndo not know what their next move may be.”\\n\\nIt was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\\nhelp should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\\ndaughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\\nsuch a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\\nminor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\\narch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\\navail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\\nspirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He\\nwas a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which\\nhung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but\\nthis suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,\\nhowever, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,\\nwith the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.\\n\\nHe expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\\nYoung as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an\\nunlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise,\\na small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over\\nhis chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:--\\n\\n“Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----”\\n\\nThe dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\\nthis warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\\nservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\\nsecured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but\\nthe incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were\\nevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What\\nstrength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\\nmysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\\nhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\\n\\nStill more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\\nbreakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\\ncentre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently,\\nthe number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\\nenlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\\nward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had\\nbeen painted upon the outside of his door.\\n\\nThus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\\nunseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\\nconspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\\nmonth of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\\nsometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\\nstuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John\\nFerrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A\\nhorror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of\\nthem. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look\\nof some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was\\nfor the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.\\n\\nTwenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news\\nof the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there\\ncame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a\\ndriver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking\\nthat help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to\\nfour and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of\\nescape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains\\nwhich surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The\\nmore-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could\\npass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he\\nwould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.\\nYet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself\\nbefore he consented to what he regarded as his daughter’s dishonour.\\n\\nHe was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and\\nsearching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the\\nfigure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last\\nof the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and\\nterrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter--what was to\\nbecome of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible\\nnetwork which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table\\nand sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.\\n\\nWhat was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low,\\nbut very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of\\nthe house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There\\nwas a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was\\nrepeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the\\npanels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry\\nout the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent\\nwho was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier\\nfelt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook\\nhis nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and\\nthrew the door open.\\n\\nOutside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the\\nfarmer’s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on\\nthe road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier\\nlooked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at\\nhis own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face\\nupon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.\\n\\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with\\nhis hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first\\nthought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying\\nman, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the\\nhall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the\\nhouse the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the\\nastonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson\\nHope.\\n\\n“Good God!” gasped John Ferrier. “How you scared me! Whatever made you\\ncome in like that.”\\n\\n“Give me food,” the other said, hoarsely. “I have had no time for bite\\nor sup for eight-and-forty hours.” He flung himself upon the [21] cold\\nmeat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host’s\\nsupper, and devoured it voraciously. “Does Lucy bear up well?” he asked,\\nwhen he had satisfied his hunger.\\n\\n“Yes. She does not know the danger,” her father answered.\\n\\n“That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled\\nmy way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they’re not quite sharp\\nenough to catch a Washoe hunter.”\\n\\nJohn Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had\\na devoted ally. He seized the young man’s leathery hand and wrung it\\ncordially. “You’re a man to be proud of,” he said. “There are not many\\nwho would come to share our danger and our troubles.”\\n\\n“You’ve hit it there, pard,” the young hunter answered. “I have a\\nrespect for you, but if you were alone in this business I’d think twice\\nbefore I put my head into such a hornet’s nest. It’s Lucy that brings me\\nhere, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o’ the\\nHope family in Utah.”\\n\\n“What are we to do?”\\n\\n“To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.\\nI have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money\\nhave you?”\\n\\n“Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.”\\n\\n“That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson\\nCity through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that\\nthe servants do not sleep in the house.”\\n\\nWhile Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching\\njourney, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into\\na small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by\\nexperience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had\\nhardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his\\ndaughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the\\nlovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was\\nmuch to be done.\\n\\n“We must make our start at once,” said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low\\nbut resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril,\\nbut has steeled his heart to meet it. “The front and back entrances are\\nwatched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and\\nacross the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the\\nRavine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way\\nthrough the mountains.”\\n\\n“What if we are stopped,” asked Ferrier.\\n\\nHope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his\\ntunic. “If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them\\nwith us,” he said with a sinister smile.\\n\\nThe lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\\ndarkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,\\nand which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved\\nhimself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and\\nhappiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.\\nAll looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad\\nsilent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that\\nthe spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set\\nexpression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house\\nhe had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.\\n\\nFerrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty\\nprovisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few\\nof her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and\\ncarefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the\\nnight, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With\\nbated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained\\nthe shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap\\nwhich opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when\\nthe young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the\\nshadow, where they lay silent and trembling.\\n\\nIt was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the\\nears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the\\nmelancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards\\nof them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small\\ndistance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the\\ngap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry\\nagain, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.\\n\\n“To-morrow at midnight,” said the first who appeared to be in authority.\\n“When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.”\\n\\n“It is well,” returned the other. “Shall I tell Brother Drebber?”\\n\\n“Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!”\\n\\n“Seven to five!” repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away\\nin different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some\\nform of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died\\naway in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his\\ncompanions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top\\nof his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength\\nappeared to fail her.\\n\\n“Hurry on! hurry on!” he gasped from time to time. “We are through the\\nline of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!”\\n\\nOnce on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they\\nmeet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid\\nrecognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a\\nrugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged\\npeaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led\\nbetween them was the Eagle Cañon in which the horses were awaiting them.\\nWith unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great\\nboulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to\\nthe retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had\\nbeen picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon\\none of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the\\nother along the precipitous and dangerous path.\\n\\nIt was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face\\nNature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a\\nthousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic\\ncolumns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster.\\nOn the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance\\nimpossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places\\nthat they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised\\nriders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and\\ndifficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them,\\nfor every step increased the distance between them and the terrible\\ndespotism from which they were flying.\\n\\nThey soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the\\njurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most\\ndesolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and\\npointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark\\nand plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them\\nas soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of “Who goes\\nthere?” rang through the silent ravine.\\n\\n“Travellers for Nevada,” said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the\\nrifle which hung by his saddle.\\n\\nThey could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at\\nthem as if dissatisfied at their reply.\\n\\n“By whose permission?” he asked.\\n\\n“The Holy Four,” answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him\\nthat that was the highest authority to which he could refer.\\n\\n“Nine from seven,” cried the sentinel.\\n\\n“Seven from five,” returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the\\ncountersign which he had heard in the garden.\\n\\n“Pass, and the Lord go with you,” said the voice from above. Beyond his\\npost the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a\\ntrot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon\\nhis gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen\\npeople, and that freedom lay before them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. THE AVENGING ANGELS.\\n\\n\\nALL night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular\\nand rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope’s\\nintimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track\\nonce more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage\\nbeauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks\\nhemmed them in, peeping over each other’s shoulders to the far horizon.\\nSo steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch\\nand the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a\\ngust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely\\nan illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and\\nboulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed,\\na great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke\\nthe echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a\\ngallop.\\n\\nAs the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until\\nthey were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the\\nhearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild\\ntorrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their\\nhorses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father\\nwould fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. “They\\nwill be upon our track by this time,” he said. “Everything depends upon\\nour speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our\\nlives.”\\n\\nDuring the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and\\nby evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from\\ntheir enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,\\nwhere the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there\\nhuddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours’ sleep. Before\\ndaybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had\\nseen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that\\nthey were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose\\nenmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could\\nreach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\\nof provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,\\nhowever, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had\\nfrequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.\\nChoosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and\\nmade a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for\\nthey were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air\\nwas bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu,\\nhe threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever\\nchance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the\\nyoung girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals\\nstood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them\\nfrom his view.\\n\\nHe walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without\\nsuccess, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other\\nindications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity.\\nAt last, after two or three hours’ fruitless search, he was thinking of\\nturning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight\\nwhich sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a\\njutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a\\ncreature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a\\npair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting,\\nprobably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter;\\nbut fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not\\nperceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and\\ntook a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang\\ninto the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and\\nthen came crashing down into the valley beneath.\\n\\nThe creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself\\nwith cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy\\nover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was\\nalready drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized\\nthe difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far\\npast the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter\\nto pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found\\nhimself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like\\neach other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other.\\nHe followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent\\nwhich he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had\\ntaken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night\\nwas coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found\\nhimself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy\\nmatter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and\\nthe high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed\\ndown with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along,\\nkeeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him\\nnearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food\\nfor the remainder of their journey.\\n\\nHe had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\\nthem. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs\\nwhich bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,\\nfor he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart\\nhe put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo\\nas a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer.\\nNone came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent\\nravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again\\nhe shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from\\nthe friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless\\ndread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the\\nprecious food in his agitation.\\n\\nWhen he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the\\nfire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,\\nbut it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same\\ndead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to\\nconvictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\\nremains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\\ntoo clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\\nhis absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no\\ntraces behind it.\\n\\nBewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin\\nround, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He\\nwas essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from\\nhis temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\\nsmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help\\nto examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet\\nof horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken\\nthe fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had\\nafterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of\\nhis companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself\\nthat they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made\\nevery nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of\\nthe camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly\\nnot been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a\\nnewly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a\\nstick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft\\nfork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:\\n\\n                        JOHN FERRIER,\\n                 FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22]\\n                    Died August 4th, 1860.\\n\\nThe sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,\\nthen, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round\\nto see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy\\nhad been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original\\ndestiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder’s son. As the young\\nfellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to\\nprevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his\\nlast silent resting-place.\\n\\nAgain, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs\\nfrom despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least\\ndevote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,\\nJefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which\\nhe may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he\\nstood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could\\nassuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought\\nby his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy\\nshould, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white\\nface, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having\\nstirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a\\nfew days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he\\nset himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the\\navenging angels.\\n\\nFor five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he\\nhad already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among\\nthe rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was\\nalways well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Cañon,\\nfrom which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could\\nlook down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned\\nupon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent\\nwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that\\nthere were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of\\nfestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\\nheard the clatter of horse’s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards\\nhim. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to\\nwhom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted\\nhim when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy\\nFerrier’s fate had been.\\n\\n“I am Jefferson Hope,” he said. “You remember me.”\\n\\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment--indeed, it was\\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\\nwhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former\\ndays. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,\\nthe man’s surprise changed to consternation.\\n\\n“You are mad to come here,” he cried. “It is as much as my own life is\\nworth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from\\nthe Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.”\\n\\n“I don’t fear them, or their warrant,” Hope said, earnestly. “You must\\nknow something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you\\nhold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For\\nGod’s sake, don’t refuse to answer me.”\\n\\n“What is it?” the Mormon asked uneasily. “Be quick. The very rocks have\\nears and the trees eyes.”\\n\\n“What has become of Lucy Ferrier?”\\n\\n“She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you\\nhave no life left in you.”\\n\\n“Don’t mind me,” said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and\\nhad sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. “Married,\\nyou say?”\\n\\n“Married yesterday--that’s what those flags are for on the Endowment\\nHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson\\nas to which was to have her. They’d both been in the party that followed\\nthem, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the\\nbest claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber’s party was\\nthe stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won’t have\\nher very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more\\nlike a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?”\\n\\n“Yes, I am off,” said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His\\nface might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its\\nexpression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\\n\\n“Where are you going?”\\n\\n“Never mind,” he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,\\nstrode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to\\nthe haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce\\nand so dangerous as himself.\\n\\nThe prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was\\nthe terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage\\ninto which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again,\\nbut pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had\\nmarried her principally for the sake of John Ferrier’s property, did not\\naffect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned\\nover her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the\\nMormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of\\nthe morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment,\\nthe door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in\\ntattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to\\nthe cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had\\nonce contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he\\npressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching\\nup her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. “She shall not be\\nburied in that,” he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could\\nbe raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief\\nwas the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe\\nit themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the\\nundeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been\\na bride had disappeared.\\n\\nFor some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading\\na strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\\nvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird\\nfigure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted\\nthe lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson’s\\nwindow and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On\\nanother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder\\ncrashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing\\nhimself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in\\ndiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\\nrepeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\\nkilling their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the\\nprecaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having\\ntheir houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these\\nmeasures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and\\nthey hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\\n\\nFar from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter’s mind\\nwas of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge\\nhad taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for\\nany other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon\\nrealized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant\\nstrain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food\\nwere wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what\\nwas to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to\\novertake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy’s\\ngame, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to\\nrecruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his\\nobject without privation.\\n\\nHis intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\\ncombination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines\\nfor nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of\\nhis wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that\\nmemorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier’s grave. Disguised,\\nand under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless\\nwhat became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to\\nbe justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a\\nschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger\\nmembers of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the\\nElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the\\nmalcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been\\nDrebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour\\nreported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his\\nproperty into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his\\ncompanion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all,\\nhowever, as to their whereabouts.\\n\\nMany a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\\nrevenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\\nfaltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out\\nby such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town\\nthrough the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into\\nyear, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human\\nbloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he\\nhad devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was\\nbut a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that\\nCleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He\\nreturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all\\narranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,\\nhad recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in\\nhis eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\\nStangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him\\nthat they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of\\nan old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and\\nnot being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at\\nlast he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber’s house was\\ndeserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.\\n\\nAgain the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\\nurged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and\\nfor some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\\napproaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\\nhim, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to\\ncity, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the\\nfugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;\\nand when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off\\nfor Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for\\nthey had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running\\nthem to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote\\nthe old hunter’s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson’s Journal,\\nto which we are already under such obligations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.\\n\\n\\nOUR prisoner’s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any\\nferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself\\npowerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that\\nhe had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. “I guess you’re going to take\\nme to the police-station,” he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. “My cab’s at\\nthe door. If you’ll loose my legs I’ll walk down to it. I’m not so light\\nto lift as I used to be.”\\n\\nGregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this\\nproposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at\\nhis word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles.\\n[23] He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that\\nthey were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed\\nhim, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark\\nsunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was\\nas formidable as his personal strength.\\n\\n“If there’s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you\\nare the man for it,” he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my\\nfellow-lodger. “The way you kept on my trail was a caution.”\\n\\n“You had better come with me,” said Holmes to the two detectives.\\n\\n“I can drive you,” said Lestrade.\\n\\n“Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have\\ntaken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.”\\n\\nI assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no\\nattempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his,\\nand we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and\\nbrought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into\\na small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner’s name\\nand the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The\\nofficial was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his\\nduties in a dull mechanical way. “The prisoner will be put before the\\nmagistrates in the course of the week,” he said; “in the mean time, Mr.\\nJefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you\\nthat your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.”\\n\\n“I’ve got a good deal to say,” our prisoner said slowly. “I want to tell\\nyou gentlemen all about it.”\\n\\n“Hadn’t you better reserve that for your trial?” asked the Inspector.\\n\\n“I may never be tried,” he answered. “You needn’t look startled. It\\nisn’t suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?” He turned his fierce\\ndark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.\\n\\n“Yes; I am,” I answered.\\n\\n“Then put your hand here,” he said, with a smile, motioning with his\\nmanacled wrists towards his chest.\\n\\nI did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and\\ncommotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to\\nthrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful\\nengine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull\\nhumming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.\\n\\n“Why,” I cried, “you have an aortic aneurism!”\\n\\n“That’s what they call it,” he said, placidly. “I went to a Doctor last\\nweek about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days\\npassed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure\\nand under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I’ve done my work now,\\nand I don’t care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account\\nof the business behind me. I don’t want to be remembered as a common\\ncut-throat.”\\n\\nThe Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the\\nadvisability of allowing him to tell his story.\\n\\n“Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?” the former\\nasked, [24]\\n\\n“Most certainly there is,” I answered.\\n\\n“In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to\\ntake his statement,” said the Inspector. “You are at liberty, sir, to\\ngive your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.”\\n\\n“I’ll sit down, with your leave,” the prisoner said, suiting the action\\nto the word. “This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the\\ntussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I’m on the brink\\nof the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the\\nabsolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me.”\\n\\nWith these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began\\nthe following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical\\nmanner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough.\\nI can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had\\naccess to Lestrade’s note-book, in which the prisoner’s words were taken\\ndown exactly as they were uttered.\\n\\n“It don’t much matter to you why I hated these men,” he said; “it’s\\nenough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a father\\nand a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own\\nlives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was\\nimpossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I\\nknew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge,\\njury, and executioner all rolled into one. You’d have done the same, if\\nyou have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.\\n\\n“That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She\\nwas forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over\\nit. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his\\ndying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts\\nshould be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried\\nit about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two\\ncontinents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they\\ncould not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing\\nthat my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished,\\nand by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.\\n\\n“They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to\\nfollow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found\\nthat I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding\\nare as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner’s office,\\nand soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the\\nowner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was\\nseldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job\\nwas to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever\\nwere contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me\\nthough, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I\\ngot on pretty well.\\n\\n“It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living;\\nbut I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They\\nwere at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the\\nriver. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I\\nhad grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me.\\nI would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was\\ndetermined that they should not escape me again.\\n\\n“They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about\\nLondon, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my\\ncab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they\\ncould not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late\\nat night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand\\nwith my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay\\nmy hand upon the men I wanted.\\n\\n“They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was\\nsome chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,\\nand never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every\\nday, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half\\nthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them\\nlate and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not\\ndiscouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My\\nonly fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon\\nand leave my work undone.\\n\\n“At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the\\nstreet was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to\\ntheir door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time\\nDrebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse\\nand kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared\\nthat they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they\\ngot out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the\\nplatform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer\\nthat one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours.\\nStangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased\\nthan otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear\\nevery word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little\\nbusiness of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he\\nwould soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded\\nhim that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the\\nmatter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch\\nwhat Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and\\nreminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he\\nmust not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up\\nas a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last\\ntrain he should rejoin him at Halliday’s Private Hotel; to which Drebber\\nanswered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made\\nhis way out of the station.\\n\\n“The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\\nenemies within my power. Together they could protect each other,\\nbut singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue\\nprecipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in\\nvengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes\\nhim, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by\\nwhich I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me\\nunderstand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days\\nbefore a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in\\nthe Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It\\nwas claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had\\ntaken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of\\nthis I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could\\nrely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house\\nwas the difficult problem which I had now to solve.\\n\\n“He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying\\nfor nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he\\nstaggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a\\nhansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close\\nthat the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way.\\nWe rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until,\\nto my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he\\nhad boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returning\\nthere; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from\\nthe house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of\\nwater, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.”\\n\\nI handed him the glass, and he drank it down.\\n\\n“That’s better,” he said. “Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or\\nmore, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the\\nhouse. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of\\nwhom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen\\nbefore. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to\\nthe head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half\\nacross the road. ‘You hound,’ he cried, shaking his stick at him; ‘I’ll\\nteach you to insult an honest girl!’ He was so hot that I think he would\\nhave thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away\\ndown the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the\\ncorner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. ‘Drive me\\nto Halliday’s Private Hotel,’ said he.\\n\\n“When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that\\nI feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove\\nalong slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might\\ntake him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane\\nhave my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he\\nsolved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and\\nhe ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word\\nthat I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and\\nwhen he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own\\nhands.\\n\\n“Don’t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only\\nhave been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself\\nto do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life\\nif he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I\\nhave filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and\\nsweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was\\nlecturing on poisions, [25] and he showed his students some alkaloid,\\nas he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow\\npoison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant\\ndeath. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when\\nthey were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly\\ngood dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and\\neach pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison.\\nI determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should\\neach have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that\\nremained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than\\nfiring across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes\\nabout with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.\\n\\n“It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\\nand raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within--so\\nglad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you\\ngentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty\\nlong years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would\\nunderstand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my\\nnerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with\\nexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy\\nlooking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I\\nsee you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each\\nside of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.\\n\\n“There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the\\ndripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber\\nall huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, ‘It’s\\ntime to get out,’ I said.\\n\\n“‘All right, cabby,’ said he.\\n\\n“I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,\\nfor he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.\\nI had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little\\ntop-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the\\nfront room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the\\ndaughter were walking in front of us.\\n\\n“‘It’s infernally dark,’ said he, stamping about.\\n\\n“‘We’ll soon have a light,’ I said, striking a match and putting it to\\na wax candle which I had brought with me. ‘Now, Enoch Drebber,’ I\\ncontinued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, ‘who am\\nI?’\\n\\n“He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I\\nsaw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which\\nshowed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I\\nsaw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered\\nin his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed\\nloud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I\\nhad never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.\\n\\n“‘You dog!’ I said; ‘I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.\\nPetersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings\\nhave come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow’s sun\\nrise.’ He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his\\nface that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my\\ntemples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit\\nof some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me.\\n\\n“‘What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?’ I cried, locking the door, and\\nshaking the key in his face. ‘Punishment has been slow in coming, but it\\nhas overtaken you at last.’ I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He\\nwould have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.\\n\\n“‘Would you murder me?’ he stammered.\\n\\n“‘There is no murder,’ I answered. ‘Who talks of murdering a mad dog?\\nWhat mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her\\nslaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless\\nharem.’\\n\\n“‘It was not I who killed her father,’ he cried.\\n\\n“‘But it was you who broke her innocent heart,’ I shrieked, thrusting\\nthe box before him. ‘Let the high God judge between us. Choose and\\neat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you\\nleave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled\\nby chance.’\\n\\n“He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my\\nknife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed\\nthe other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or\\nmore, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I\\never forget the look which came over his face when the first warning\\npangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw\\nit, and held Lucy’s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for\\na moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain\\ncontorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,\\nstaggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I\\nturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There\\nwas no movement. He was dead!\\n\\n“The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of\\nit. I don’t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the\\nwall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police\\nupon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered\\na German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it\\nwas argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must\\nhave done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle\\nthe Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on\\na convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found\\nthat there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I\\nhad driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which\\nI usually kept Lucy’s ring, and found that it was not there. I was\\nthunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her.\\nThinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber’s\\nbody, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly\\nup to the house--for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose\\nthe ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a\\npolice-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his\\nsuspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.\\n\\n“That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was\\nto do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier’s debt. I knew\\nthat he was staying at Halliday’s Private Hotel, and I hung about all\\nday, but he never came out. [26] fancy that he suspected something when\\nDrebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson,\\nand always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by staying\\nindoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the window\\nof his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders\\nwhich were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into\\nhis room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that the\\nhour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long\\nbefore. I described Drebber’s death to him, and I gave him the same\\nchoice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of\\nsafety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my\\nthroat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been\\nthe same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty\\nhand to pick out anything but the poison.\\n\\n“I have little more to say, and it’s as well, for I am about done up.\\nI went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I\\ncould save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the\\nyard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called\\nJefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B,\\nBaker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I\\nknew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly\\nsnackled [27] as ever I saw in my life. That’s the whole of my story,\\ngentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am\\njust as much an officer of justice as you are.”\\n\\nSo thrilling had the man’s narrative been, and his manner was so\\nimpressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional\\ndetectives, _blasé_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to\\nbe keenly interested in the man’s story. When he finished we sat for\\nsome minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching\\nof Lestrade’s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand\\naccount.\\n\\n“There is only one point on which I should like a little more\\ninformation,” Sherlock Holmes said at last. “Who was your accomplice who\\ncame for the ring which I advertised?”\\n\\nThe prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. “I can tell my own secrets,”\\n he said, “but I don’t get other people into trouble. I saw your\\nadvertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the\\nring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think you’ll\\nown he did it smartly.”\\n\\n“Not a doubt of that,” said Holmes heartily.\\n\\n“Now, gentlemen,” the Inspector remarked gravely, “the forms of the law\\nmust be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before\\nthe magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I will\\nbe responsible for him.” He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson\\nHope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our\\nway out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. THE CONCLUSION.\\n\\n\\nWE had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the\\nThursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our\\ntestimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson\\nHope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would\\nbe meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism\\nburst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the\\ncell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able\\nin his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well\\ndone.\\n\\n“Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,” Holmes remarked, as\\nwe chatted it over next evening. “Where will their grand advertisement\\nbe now?”\\n\\n“I don’t see that they had very much to do with his capture,” I\\nanswered.\\n\\n“What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,” returned my\\ncompanion, bitterly. “The question is, what can you make people believe\\nthat you have done. Never mind,” he continued, more brightly, after a\\npause. “I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There\\nhas been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there\\nwere several most instructive points about it.”\\n\\n“Simple!” I ejaculated.\\n\\n“Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,” said Sherlock\\nHolmes, smiling at my surprise. “The proof of its intrinsic simplicity\\nis, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able\\nto lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.”\\n\\n“That is true,” said I.\\n\\n“I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is\\nusually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this\\nsort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very\\nuseful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise\\nit much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason\\nforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who\\ncan reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.”\\n\\n“I confess,” said I, “that I do not quite follow you.”\\n\\n“I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.\\nMost people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you\\nwhat the result would be. They can put those events together in their\\nminds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are\\nfew people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to\\nevolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led\\nup to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning\\nbackwards, or analytically.”\\n\\n“I understand,” said I.\\n\\n“Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to\\nfind everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the\\ndifferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached\\nthe house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all\\nimpressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I\\nhave already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which,\\nI ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I\\nsatisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the\\nnarrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably\\nless wide than a gentleman’s brougham.\\n\\n“This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden\\npath, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable\\nfor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere\\ntrampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its\\nsurface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which\\nis so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.\\nHappily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice\\nhas made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the\\nconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed\\nthrough the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the\\nothers, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by\\nthe others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was\\nformed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number,\\none remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his\\nstride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and\\nelegant impression left by his boots.\\n\\n“On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted\\nman lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder\\nthere was. There was no wound upon the dead man’s person, but the\\nagitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his\\nfate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any\\nsudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their\\nfeatures. Having sniffed the dead man’s lips I detected a slightly sour\\nsmell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon\\nhim. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred\\nand fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had\\narrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts.\\nDo not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible\\nadministration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals.\\nThe cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will\\noccur at once to any toxicologist.\\n\\n“And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not\\nbeen the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,\\nthen, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me.\\nI was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political\\nassassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder\\nhad, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator\\nhad left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there\\nall the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political\\none, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription\\nwas discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my\\nopinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,\\nhowever, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to\\nremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point\\nthat I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to\\nCleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber’s former career. He\\nanswered, you remember, in the negative.\\n\\n“I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which\\nconfirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer’s height, and furnished me\\nwith the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length\\nof his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no\\nsigns of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst\\nfrom the murderer’s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the\\ntrack of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that\\nany man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through\\nemotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a\\nrobust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.\\n\\n“Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry\\nto the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The\\nanswer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for\\nthe protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson\\nHope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that\\nI held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to\\nsecure the murderer.\\n\\n“I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked\\ninto the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven\\nthe cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered\\non in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in\\ncharge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside\\nthe house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry\\nout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third\\nperson, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished\\nto dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than\\nto turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible\\nconclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the\\nMetropolis.\\n\\n“If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to\\nbe. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be\\nlikely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at\\nleast, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose\\nthat he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name\\nin a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized\\nmy Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every\\ncab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted.\\nHow well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are\\nstill fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an\\nincident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in\\nany case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into\\npossession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.\\nYou see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break\\nor flaw.”\\n\\n“It is wonderful!” I cried. “Your merits should be publicly recognized.\\nYou should publish an account of the case. If you won’t, I will for\\nyou.”\\n\\n“You may do what you like, Doctor,” he answered. “See here!” he\\ncontinued, handing a paper over to me, “look at this!”\\n\\nIt was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was\\ndevoted to the case in question.\\n\\n“The public,” it said, “have lost a sensational treat through the sudden\\ndeath of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch\\nDrebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will\\nprobably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority\\nthat the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in\\nwhich love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victims\\nbelonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the\\ndeceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had\\nno other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner\\nthe efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson\\nto all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at\\nhome, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret\\nthat the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known\\nScotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was\\napprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\nwho has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective\\nline, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some\\ndegree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial of some sort\\nwill be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their\\nservices.”\\n\\n“Didn’t I tell you so when we started?” cried Sherlock Holmes with a\\nlaugh. “That’s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a\\ntestimonial!”\\n\\n“Never mind,” I answered, “I have all the facts in my journal, and the\\npublic shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented\\nby the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser--\\n\\n            “‘Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo\\n       Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.’”\\n',\n",
       " '\\nBOOK I\\n\\nTHE PURPLE ORCHID\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nA CRY ON THE HILL\\n\\n\\nThe dance was over. From the great house on the hill the guests had all\\ndeparted and only the musicians remained. As they filed out through the\\nample doorway, on their way home, the first faint streak of early dawn\\nbecame visible in the east. One of them, a lank, plain-featured young\\nman of ungainly aspect but penetrating eye, called the attention of the\\nothers to it.\\n\\n\"Look!\" said he; \"there is the daylight! This has been a gay night for\\nSutherlandtown.\"\\n\\n\"Too gay,\" muttered another, starting aside as the slight figure of a\\nyoung man coming from the house behind them rushed hastily by. \"Why,\\nwho\\'s that?\"\\n\\nAs they one and all had recognised the person thus alluded to, no one\\nanswered till he had dashed out of the gate and disappeared in the woods\\non the other side of the road. Then they all spoke at once.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Mr. Frederick!\"\\n\\n\"He seems in a desperate hurry.\"\\n\\n\"He trod on my toes.\"\\n\\n\"Did you hear the words he was muttering as he went by?\"\\n\\nAs only the last question was calculated to rouse any interest, it alone\\nreceived attention.\\n\\n\"No; what were they? I heard him say something, but I failed to catch\\nthe words.\"\\n\\n\"He wasn\\'t talking to you, or to me either, for that matter; but I have\\nears that can hear an eye wink. He said: \\'Thank God, this night of\\nhorror is over!\\' Think of that! After such a dance and such a spread, he\\ncalls the night horrible and thanks God that it is over. I thought he\\nwas the very man to enjoy this kind of thing.\"\\n\\n\"So did I.\"\\n\\n\"And so did I.\"\\n\\nThe five musicians exchanged looks, then huddled in a group at the gate.\\n\\n\"He has quarrelled with his sweetheart,\" suggested one.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not surprised at that,\" declared another. \"I never thought it would\\nbe a match.\"\\n\\n\"Shame if it were!\" muttered the ungainly youth who had spoken first.\\n\\nAs the subject of this comment was the son of the gentleman whose house\\nthey were just leaving, they necessarily spoke low; but their tones were\\nrife with curiosity, and it was evident that the topic deeply interested\\nthem. One of the five who had not previously spoken now put in a word:\\n\\n\"I saw him when he first led out Miss Page to dance, and I saw him again\\nwhen he stood up opposite her in the last quadrille, and I tell you,\\nboys, there was a mighty deal of difference in the way he conducted\\nhimself toward her in the beginning of the evening and the last. You\\nwouldn\\'t have thought him the same man. Reckless young fellows like him\\nare not to be caught by dimples only. They want cash.\"\\n\\n\"Or family, at least; and she hasn\\'t either. But what a pretty girl she\\nis! Many a fellow as rich as he and as well connected would be satisfied\\nwith her good looks alone.\"\\n\\n\"Good looks!\" High scorn was observable in this exclamation, which was\\nmade by the young man whom I have before characterised as ungainly. \"I\\nrefuse to acknowledge that she has any good looks. On the contrary, I\\nconsider her plain.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Oh!\" burst in protest from more than one mouth. \"And why does she\\nhave every fellow in the room dangling after her, then?\" asked the\\nplayer on the flageolet.\\n\\n\"She hasn\\'t a regular feature.\"\\n\\n\"What difference does that make when it isn\\'t her features you notice,\\nbut herself?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like her.\"\\n\\nA laugh followed this.\\n\\n\"That won\\'t trouble her, Sweetwater. Sutherland does, if you don\\'t, and\\nthat\\'s much more to the point. And he\\'ll marry her yet; he can\\'t help\\nit. Why, she\\'d witch the devil into leading her to the altar if she took\\na notion to have him for her bridegroom.\"\\n\\n\"There would be consistency in that,\" muttered the fellow just\\naddressed. \"But Mr. Frederick--\"\\n\\n\"Hush! There\\'s some one on the doorstep. Why, it\\'s she!\"\\n\\nThey all glanced back. The graceful figure of a young girl dressed in\\nwhite was to be seen leaning toward them from the open doorway. Behind\\nher shone a blaze of light--the candles not having been yet extinguished\\nin the hall--and against this brilliant background her slight form, with\\nall its bewitching outlines, stood out in plain relief.\\n\\n\"Who was that?\" she began in a high, almost strident voice, totally out\\nof keeping with the sensuous curves of her strange, sweet face. But the\\nquestion remained unanswered, for at that moment her attention, as well\\nas that of the men lingering at the gate, was attracted by the sound of\\nhurrying feet and confused cries coming up the hill.\\n\\n\"Murder! Murder!\" was the word panted out by more than one harsh voice;\\nand in another instant a dozen men and boys came rushing into sight in a\\nstate of such excitement that the five musicians recoiled from the gate,\\nand one of them went so far as to start back toward the house. As he did\\nso he noticed a curious thing. The young woman whom they had all\\nperceived standing in the door a moment before had vanished, yet she was\\nknown to possess the keenest curiosity of any one in town.\\n\\n\"Murder! Murder!\" A terrible and unprecedented cry in this old,\\nGod-fearing town. Then came in hoarse explanation from the jostling\\ngroup as they stopped at the gate: \"Mrs. Webb has been killed! Stabbed\\nwith a knife! Tell Mr. Sutherland!\"\\n\\nMrs. Webb!\\n\\nAs the musicians heard this name, so honoured and so universally\\nbeloved, they to a man uttered a cry. Mrs. Webb! Why, it was impossible.\\nShouting in their turn for Mr. Sutherland, they all crowded forward.\\n\\n\"Not Mrs. Webb!\" they protested. \"Who could have the daring or the heart\\nto kill HER?\"\\n\\n\"God knows,\" answered a voice from the highway. \"But she\\'s dead--we\\'ve\\njust seen her!\"\\n\\n\"Then it\\'s the old man\\'s work,\" quavered a piping voice. \"I\\'ve always\\nsaid he would turn on his best friend some day. \\'Sylum\\'s the best place\\nfor folks as has lost their wits. I--\"\\n\\nBut here a hand was put over his mouth, and the rest of the words was\\nlost in an inarticulate gurgle. Mr. Sutherland had just appeared on the\\nporch.\\n\\nHe was a superb-looking man, with an expression of mingled kindness and\\ndignity that invariably awakened both awe and admiration in the\\nspectator. No man in the country--I was going to say no woman was more\\nbeloved, or held in higher esteem. Yet he could not control his only\\nson, as everyone within ten miles of the hill well knew.\\n\\nAt this moment his face showed both pain and shock.\\n\\n\"What name are you shouting out there?\" he brokenly demanded. \"Agatha\\nWebb? Is Agatha Webb hurt?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; killed,\" repeated a half-dozen voices at once. \"We\\'ve just\\ncome from the house. All the town is up. Some say her husband did it.\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" was Mr. Sutherland\\'s decisive though half-inaudible response.\\n\"Philemon Webb might end his own life, but not Agatha\\'s. It was the\\nmoney--\"\\n\\nHere he caught himself up, and, raising his voice, addressed the crowd\\nof villagers more directly.\\n\\n\"Wait,\" said he, \"and I will go back with you. Where is Frederick?\" he\\ndemanded of such members of his own household as stood about him.\\n\\nNo one knew.\\n\\n\"I wish some one would find my son. I want him to go into town with me.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s over in the woods there,\" volunteered a voice from without.\\n\\n\"In the woods!\" repeated the father, in a surprised tone.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; we all saw him go. Shall we sing out to him?\"\\n\\n\"No, no; I will manage very well without him.\" And taking up his hat Mr.\\nSutherland stepped out again upon the porch.\\n\\nSuddenly he stopped. A hand had been laid on his arm and an insinuating\\nvoice was murmuring in his ear:\\n\\n\"Do you mind if I go with you? I will not make any trouble.\"\\n\\nIt was the same young lady we have seen before.\\n\\nThe old gentleman frowned--he who never frowned and remarked shortly:\\n\\n\"A scene of murder is no place for women.\"\\n\\nThe face upturned to his remained unmoved.\\n\\n\"I think I will go,\" she quietly persisted. \"I can easily mingle with\\nthe crowd.\"\\n\\nHe said not another word against it. Miss Page was under pay in his\\nhouse, but for the last few weeks no one had undertaken to contradict\\nher. In the interval since her first appearance on the porch, she had\\nexchanged the light dress in which she had danced at the ball, for a\\ndarker and more serviceable one, and perhaps this token of her\\ndetermination may have had its influence in silencing him. He joined the\\ncrowd, and together they moved down-hill. This was too much for the\\nservants of the house. One by one they too left the house till it stood\\nabsolutely empty. Jerry snuffed out the candles and shut the front door,\\nbut the side entrance stood wide open, and into this entrance, as the\\nlast footstep died out on the hillside, passed a slight and resolute\\nfigure. It was that of the musician who had questioned Miss Page\\'s\\nattractions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nONE NIGHT\\'S WORK\\n\\n\\nSutherlandtown was a seaport. The village, which was a small one,\\nconsisted of one long street and numerous cross streets running down\\nfrom the hillside and ending on the wharves. On one of the corners thus\\nmade, stood the Webb house, with its front door on the main street and\\nits side door on one of the hillside lanes. As the group of men and boys\\nwho had been in search of Mr. Sutherland entered this last-mentioned\\nlane, they could pick out this house from all the others, as it was the\\nonly one in which a light was still burning. Mr. Sutherland lost no time\\nin entering upon the scene of tragedy. As his imposing figure emerged\\nfrom the darkness and paused on the outskirts of the crowd that was\\nblocking up every entrance to the house, a murmur of welcome went up,\\nafter which a way was made for him to the front door.\\n\\nBut before he could enter, some one plucked him by the sleeve.\\n\\n\"Look up!\" whispered a voice into his ear.\\n\\nHe did so, and saw a woman\\'s body hanging half out of an upper window.\\nIt hung limp, and the sight made him sick, notwithstanding his\\nthreescore years of experience.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s that?\" he cried. \"That\\'s not Agatha Webb.\"\\n\\n\"No, that\\'s Batsy, the cook. She\\'s dead as well as her mistress. We left\\nher where we found her for the coroner to see.\"\\n\\n\"But this is horrible,\" murmured Mr. Sutherland. \"Has there been a\\nbutcher here?\"\\n\\nAs he uttered these words, he felt another quick pressure on his arm.\\nLooking down, he saw leaning against him the form of a young woman, but\\nbefore he could address her she had started upright again and was moving\\non with the throng. It was Miss Page.\\n\\n\"It was the sight of this woman hanging from the window which first drew\\nattention to the house,\" volunteered a man who was standing as a sort of\\nguardian at the main gateway. \"Some of the sailors\\' wives who had been\\nto the wharves to see their husbands off on the ship that sailed at\\ndaybreak, saw it as they came up the lane on their way home, and gave\\nthe alarm. Without that we might not have known to this hour what had\\nhappened.\"\\n\\n\"But Mrs. Webb?\"\\n\\n\"Come in and see.\"\\n\\nThere was a board fence about the simple yard within which stood the\\nhumble house forever after to be pointed out as the scene of\\nSutherlandtown\\'s most heart-rending tragedy. In this fence was a gate,\\nand through this gate now passed Mr. Sutherland, followed by his\\nwould-be companion, Miss Page. A path bordered by lilac bushes led up to\\nthe house, the door of which stood wide open. As soon as Mr. Sutherland\\nentered upon this path a man approached him from the doorway. It was\\nAmos Fenton, the constable.\\n\\n\"Ah, Mr. Sutherland,\" said he, \"sad business, a very sad business! But\\nwhat little girl have you there?\"\\n\\n\"This is Miss Page, my housekeeper\\'s niece. She would come.\\nInquisitiveness the cause. I do not approve of it.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Page must remain on the doorstep. We allow no one inside excepting\\nyourself,\" he said respectfully, in recognition of the fact that nothing\\nof importance was ever undertaken in Sutherlandtown without the\\npresence of Mr. Sutherland.\\n\\nMiss Page curtsied, looking so bewitching in the fresh morning light\\nthat the tough old constable scratched his chin in grudging admiration.\\nBut he did not reconsider his determination. Seeing this, she accepted\\nher defeat gracefully, and moved aside to where the bushes offered her\\nmore or less protection from the curiosity of those about her. Meanwhile\\nMr. Sutherland had stepped into the house.\\n\\nHe found himself in a small hall with a staircase in front and an open\\ndoor at the left. On the threshold of this open door a man stood, who at\\nsight of him doffed his hat. Passing by this man, Mr. Sutherland entered\\nthe room beyond. A table spread with eatables met his view, beside\\nwhich, in an attitude which struck him at the moment as peculiar, sat\\nPhilemon Webb, the well-known master of the house.\\n\\nAstonished at seeing his old friend in this room and in such a position,\\nhe was about to address him, when Mr. Fenton stopped him.\\n\\n\"Wait!\" said he. \"Take a look at poor Philemon before you disturb him.\\nWhen we broke into the house a half-hour ago he was sitting just as you\\nsee him now, and we have let him be for reasons you can easily\\nappreciate. Examine him closely, Mr. Sutherland; he won\\'t notice it.\"\\n\\n\"But what ails him? Why does he sit crouched against the table? Is he\\nhurt too?\"\\n\\n\"No; look at his eyes.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland stooped and pushed aside the long grey locks that half\\nconcealed the countenance of his aged friend.\\n\\n\"Why,\" he cried, startled, \"they are closed! He isn\\'t dead?\"\\n\\n\"No, he is asleep.\"\\n\\n\"Asleep?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. He was asleep when we came in and he is asleep yet. Some of the\\nneighbours wanted to wake him, but I would not let them. His wits are\\nnot strong enough to bear a sudden shock.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, poor Philemon! But that he should sit sleeping here while\\nshe--But what do these bottles mean and this parade of supper in a room\\nthey were not accustomed to eat in?\"\\n\\n\"We don\\'t know. It has not been eaten, you see. He has swallowed a glass\\nof port, but that is all. The other glasses have had no wine in them,\\nnor have the victuals been touched.\"\\n\\n\"Seats set for three and only one occupied,\" murmured Mr. Sutherland.\\n\"Strange! Could he have expected guests?\"\\n\\n\"It looks like it. I didn\\'t know that his wife allowed him such\\nprivileges; but she was always too good to him, and I fear has paid for\\nit with her life.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense! he never killed her. Had his love been anything short of the\\nworship it was, he stood in too much awe of her to lift his hand against\\nher, even in his most demented moments.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t trust men of uncertain wits,\" returned the other. \"You have not\\nnoticed everything that is to be seen in this room.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland, recalled to himself by these words, looked quickly about\\nhim. With the exception of the table and what was on and by it there was\\nnothing else in the room. Naturally his glance returned to Philemon\\nWebb.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see anything but this poor sleeping man,\" he began.\\n\\n\"Look at his sleeve.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland, with a start, again bent down. The arm of his old friend\\nlay crooked upon the table, and on its blue cotton sleeve there was a\\nsmear which might have been wine, but which was--blood.\\n\\nAs Mr. Sutherland became assured of this, he turned slightly pale and\\nlooked inquiringly at the two men who were intently watching him.\\n\\n\"This is bad,\" said he. \"Any other marks of blood below stairs?\"\\n\\n\"No; that one smear is all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Philemon!\" burst from Mr. Sutherland, in deep emotion. Then, as he\\nlooked long and shudderingly at his friend, he added slowly:\\n\\n\"He has been in the room where she was killed; so much is evident. But\\nthat he understood what was done there I cannot believe, or he would not\\nbe sleeping here like a log. Come, let us go up-stairs.\"\\n\\nFenton, with an admonitory gesture toward his subordinate, turned\\ndirectly toward the staircase. Mr. Sutherland followed him, and they at\\nonce proceeded to the upper hall and into the large front room which had\\nbeen the scene of the tragedy.\\n\\nIt was the parlour or sitting-room of this small and unpretentious\\nhouse. A rag carpet covered the floor and the furniture was of the\\nplainest kind, but the woman who lay outstretched on the stiff,\\nold-fashioned lounge opposite the door was far from being in accord with\\nthe homely type of her surroundings. Though the victim of a violent\\ndeath, her face and form, both of a beauty seldom to be found among\\nwomen of any station, were so majestic in their calm repose, that Mr.\\nSutherland, accustomed as he was to her noble appearance, experienced a\\nshock of surprise that found vent in these words:\\n\\n\"Murdered! she? You have made some mistake, my friends. Look at her\\nface!\"\\n\\nBut even in the act of saying this his eyes fell on the blood which had\\ndyed her cotton dress and he cried:\\n\\n\"Where was she struck and where is the weapon which has made this\\nghastly wound?\"\\n\\n\"She was struck while standing or sitting at this table,\" returned the\\nconstable, pointing to two or three drops of blood on its smooth\\nsurface. \"The weapon we have not found, but the wound shows that it was\\ninflicted by a three-sided dagger.\"\\n\\n\"A three-sided dagger?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know there was such a thing in town. Philemon could have had\\nno dagger.\"\\n\\n\"It does not seem so, but one can never tell. Simple cottages like these\\noften contain the most unlooked-for articles.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine a dagger being among its effects,\" declared Mr.\\nSutherland. \"Where was the body of Mrs. Webb lying when you came in?\"\\n\\n\"Where you see it now. Nothing has been moved or changed.\"\\n\\n\"She was found here, on this lounge, in the same position in which we\\nsee her now?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"But that is incredible. Look at the way she lies! Hands crossed, eyes\\nclosed, as though made ready for her burial. Only loving hands could\\nhave done this. What does it mean?\"\\n\\n\"It means Philemon; that is what it means Philemon.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland shuddered, but said nothing. He was dumbfounded by these\\nevidences of a crazy man\\'s work. Philemon Webb always seemed so\\nharmless, though he had been failing in mind for the last ten years.\\n\\n\"But\" cried Mr. Sutherland, suddenly rousing, \"there is another victim.\\nI saw old woman Batsy hanging from a window ledge, dead.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she is in this other room; but there is no wound on Batsy.\"\\n\\n\"How was she killed, then?\"\\n\\n\"That the doctors must tell us.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland, guided by Mr. Fenton\\'s gesture, entered a small room\\nopening into the one in which they stood. His attention was at once\\nattracted by the body of the woman he had seen from below, lying half in\\nand half out of the open window. That she was dead was evident; but, as\\nMr. Fenton had said, no wound was to be seen upon her, nor were there\\nany marks of blood on or about the place where she lay.\\n\\n\"This is a dreadful business,\" groaned Mr. Sutherland, \"the worst I have\\never had anything to do with. Help me to lift the woman in; she has been\\nlong enough a show for the people outside.\"\\n\\nThere was a bed in this room (indeed, it was Mrs. Webb\\'s bedroom), and\\nupon this poor Batsy was laid. As the face came uppermost both gentlemen\\nstarted and looked at each other in amazement. The expression of terror\\nand alarm which it showed was in striking contrast to the look of\\nexaltation to be seen on the face of her dead mistress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\nTHE EMPTY DRAWER\\n\\n\\nAs they re-entered the larger room, they were astonished to come upon\\nMiss Page standing in the doorway. She was gazing at the recumbent\\nfigure of the dead woman, and for a moment seemed unconscious of their\\npresence.\\n\\n\"How did you get in? Which of my men was weak enough to let you pass,\\nagainst my express instructions?\" asked the constable, who was of an\\nirritable and suspicious nature.\\n\\nShe let the hood drop from her head, and, turning, surveyed him with a\\nslow smile. There was witchery in that smile sufficient to affect a much\\nmore cultivated and callous nature than his, and though he had been\\nproof against it once he could not quite resist the effect of its\\nrepetition.\\n\\n\"I insisted upon entering,\" said she. \"Do not blame the men; they did\\nnot want to use force against a woman.\" She had not a good voice and she\\nknew it; but she covered up this defect by a choice of intonations that\\ncarried her lightest speech to the heart. Hard-visaged Amos Fenton gave\\na grunt, which was as near an expression of approval as he ever gave to\\nanyone.\\n\\n\"Well! well!\" he growled, but not ill-naturedly, \"it\\'s a morbid\\ncuriosity that brings you here. Better drop it, girl; it won\\'t do you\\nany good in the eyes of sensible people.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" was her demure reply, her lips dimpling at the corners in a\\nway to shock the sensitive Mr. Sutherland.\\n\\nGlancing from her to the still outlines of the noble figure on the\\ncouch, he remarked with an air of mild reproof:\\n\\n\"I do not understand you, Miss Page. If this solemn sight has no power\\nto stop your coquetries, nothing can. As for your curiosity, it is both\\nill-timed and unwomanly. Let me see you leave this house at once, Miss\\nPage; and if in the few hours which must elapse before breakfast you can\\nfind time to pack your trunks, you will still farther oblige me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t send me away, I entreat you.\"\\n\\nIt was a cry from her inner heart, which she probably regretted, for she\\ninstantly sought to cover up her inadvertent self-betrayal by a\\nsubmissive bend of the head and a step backward. Neither Mr. Fenton nor\\nMr. Sutherland seemed to hear the one or see the other, their attention\\nhaving returned to the more serious matter in hand.\\n\\n\"The dress which our poor friend wears shows her to have been struck\\nbefore retiring,\" commented Mr. Sutherland, after another short survey\\nof Mrs. Webb\\'s figure. \"If Philemon--\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" interrupted the voice of the young man who had been\\nleft in the hall, \"the lady is listening to what you say. She is still\\nat the head of the stairs.\"\\n\\n\"She is, is she!\" cried Fenton, sharply, his admiration for the\\nfascinating stranger having oozed out at his companion\\'s rebuff. \"I will\\nsoon show her--\" But the words melted into thin air as he reached the\\ndoor. The young girl had disappeared, and only a faint perfume remained\\nin the place where she had stood.\\n\\n\"A most extraordinary person,\" grumbled the constable, turning back, but\\nstopping again as a faint murmur came up from below.\\n\\n\"The gentleman is waking,\" called up a voice whose lack of music was\\nquite perceptible at a distance.\\n\\nWith a bound Mr. Fenton descended the stairs, followed by Mr.\\nSutherland.\\n\\nMiss Page stood before the door of the room in which sat Philemon Webb.\\nAs they reached her side, she made a little bow that was half mocking,\\nhalf deprecatory, and slipped from the house. An almost unbearable\\nsensation of incongruity vanished with her, and Mr. Sutherland, for one,\\nbreathed like a man relieved.\\n\\n\"I wish the doctor would come,\" Fenton said, as they watched the slow\\nlifting of Philemon Webb\\'s head. \"Our fastest rider has gone for him,\\nbut he\\'s out Portchester way, and it may be an hour yet before he can\\nget here.\"\\n\\n\"Philemon!\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland had advanced and was standing by his old friend\\'s side.\\n\\n\"Philemon, what has become of your guests? You\\'ve waited for them here\\nuntil morning.\"\\n\\nThe old man with a dazed look surveyed the two plates set on either side\\nof him and shook his head.\\n\\n\"James and John are getting proud,\" said he, \"or they forget, they\\nforget.\"\\n\\nJames and John. He must mean the Zabels, yet there were many others\\nanswering to these names in town. Mr. Sutherland made another effort.\\n\\n\"Philemon, where is your wife? I do not see any place set here for her!\"\\n\\n\"Agatha\\'s sick, Agatha\\'s cross; she don\\'t care for a poor old man like\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"Agatha\\'s dead and you know it,\" thundered back the constable, with\\nill-judged severity. \"Who killed her? tell me that. Who killed her?\"\\n\\nA sudden quenching of the last spark of intelligence in the old man\\'s\\neye was the dreadful effect of these words. Laughing with that strange\\ngurgle which proclaims an utterly irresponsible mind, he cried:\\n\\n\"The pussy cat! It was the pussy cat. Who\\'s killed? I\\'m not killed.\\nLet\\'s go to Jericho.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland took him by the arm and led him up-stairs. Perhaps the\\nsight of his dead wife would restore him. But he looked at her with the\\nsame indifference he showed to everything else.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like her calico dresses,\" said he. \"She might have worn silk,\\nbut she wouldn\\'t. Agatha, will you wear silk to my funeral?\"\\n\\nThe experiment was too painful, and they drew him away. But the\\nconstable\\'s curiosity had been roused, and after they had found some one\\nto take care of him, he drew Mr. Sutherland aside and said:\\n\\n\"What did the old man mean by saying she might have worn silk? Are they\\nbetter off than they seem?\" Mr. Sutherland closed the door before\\nreplying.\\n\\n\"They are rich,\" he declared, to the utter amazement of the other. \"That\\nis, they were; but they may have been robbed; if so, Philemon was not\\nthe wretch who killed her. I have been told that she kept her money in\\nan old-fashioned cupboard. Do you suppose they alluded to that one?\"\\n\\nHe pointed to a door set in the wall over the fireplace, and Mr. Fenton,\\nperceiving a key sticking in the lock, stepped quickly across the floor\\nand opened it. A row of books met his eyes, but on taking them down a\\ncouple of drawers were seen at the back.\\n\\n\"Are they locked?\" asked Mr. Sutherland.\\n\\n\"One is and one is not.\"\\n\\n\"Open the one that is unlocked.\"\\n\\nMr. Fenton did so.\\n\\n\"It is empty,\" said he.\\n\\nMr. Sutherland cast a look toward the dead woman, and again the perfect\\nserenity of her countenance struck him.\\n\\n\"I do not know whether to regard her as the victim of her husband\\'s\\nimbecility or of some vile robber\\'s cupidity. Can you find the key to\\nthe other drawer?\"\\n\\n\"I will try.\"\\n\\n\"Suppose you begin, then, by looking on her person. It should be in her\\npocket, if no marauder has been here.\"\\n\\n\"It is not in her pocket.\"\\n\\n\"Hanging to her neck, then, by a string?\"\\n\\n\"No; there is a locket here, but no key. A very handsome locket, Mr.\\nSutherland, with a child\\'s lock of golden hair--\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, we will see that later; it is the key we want just now.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"It is in her hand; the one that lies underneath.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! A point, Fenton.\"\\n\\n\"A great point.\"\\n\\n\"Stand by her, Fenton. Don\\'t let anyone rob her of that key till the\\ncoroner comes, and we are at liberty to take it.\"\\n\\n\"I will not leave her for an instant.\"\\n\\n\"Meanwhile, I will put back these books.\"\\n\\nHe had scarcely done so when a fresh arrival occurred. This time it was\\none of the village clergymen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\nTHE FULL DRAWER\\n\\n\\nThis gentleman had some information to give. It seems that at an early\\nhour of this same night he had gone by this house on his way home from\\nthe bedside of a sick parishioner. As he was passing the gate he was run\\ninto by a man who came rushing out of the yard, in a state of violent\\nagitation. In this man\\'s hand was something that glittered, and though\\nthe encounter nearly upset them both, he had not stopped to utter an\\napology, but stumbled away out of sight with a hasty but infirm step,\\nwhich showed he was neither young nor active. The minister had failed to\\nsee his face, but noticed the ends of a long beard blowing over his\\nshoulder as he hurried away.\\n\\nPhilemon was a clean-shaven man.\\n\\nAsked if he could give the time of this encounter, he replied that it\\nwas not far from midnight, as he was in his own house by half-past\\ntwelve.\\n\\n\"Did you glance up at these windows in passing?\" asked Mr. Fenton.\\n\\n\"I must have; for I now remember they were both lighted.\"\\n\\n\"Were the shades up?\"\\n\\n\"I think not. I would have noticed it if they had been.\"\\n\\n\"How were the shades when you broke into the house this morning?\"\\ninquired Mr. Sutherland of the constable.\\n\\n\"Just as they are now; we have moved nothing. The shades were both\\ndown--one of them over an open window.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we may find this encounter of yours with this unknown man a\\nmatter of vital importance, Mr. Crane.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I had seen his face.\"\\n\\n\"What do you think the object was you saw glittering in his hand?\"\\n\\n\"I should not like to say; I saw it but an instant.\"\\n\\n\"Could it have been a knife or an old-fashioned dagger?\"\\n\\n\"It might have been.\"\\n\\n\"Alas! poor Agatha! That she, who so despised money, should fall a\\nvictim to man\\'s cupidity! Unhappy life, unhappy death! Fenton, I shall\\nalways mourn for Agatha Webb.\"\\n\\n\"Yet she seems to have found peace at last,\" observed the minister. \"I\\nhave never seen her look so contented.\" And leading Mr. Sutherland\\naside, he whispered: \"What is this you say about money? Had she, in\\nspite of appearances, any considerable amount? I ask, because in spite\\nof her humble home and simple manner of living, she always put more on\\nthe plate than any of her neighbours. Besides which, I have from time to\\ntime during my pastorate received anonymously certain contributions,\\nwhich, as they were always for sick or suffering children--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes; they came from her, I have no doubt of it. She was by no\\nmeans poor, though I myself never knew the extent of her means till\\nlately. Philemon was a good business man once; but they evidently\\npreferred to live simply, having no children living--\"\\n\\n\"They have lost six, I have been told.\"\\n\\n\"So the Portchester folks say. They probably had no heart for display or\\nfor even the simplest luxuries. At all events, they did not indulge in\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"Philemon has long been past indulging in anything.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he likes his comfort, and he has had it too. Agatha never stinted\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"But why do you think her death was due to her having money?\"\\n\\n\"She had a large sum in the house, and there are those in town who knew\\nthis.\"\\n\\n\"And is it gone?\"\\n\\n\"That we shall know later.\"\\n\\nAs the coroner arrived at this moment, the minister\\'s curiosity had to\\nwait. Fortunately for his equanimity, no one had the presumption to ask\\nhim to leave the room.\\n\\nThe coroner was a man of but few words, and but little given to emotion.\\nYet they were surprised at his first question:\\n\\n\"Who is the young woman standing outside there, the only one in the\\nyard?\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland, moving rapidly to the window, drew aside the shade.\\n\\n\"It is Miss Page, my housekeeper\\'s niece,\" he explained. \"I do not\\nunderstand her interest in this affair. She followed me here from the\\nhouse and could hardly be got to leave this room, into which she\\nintruded herself against my express command.\"\\n\\n\"But look at her attitude!\" It was Mr. Fenton who spoke. \"She\\'s crazier\\nthan Philemon, it seems to me.\"\\n\\nThere was some reason for this remark. Guarded by the high fence from\\nthe gaze of the pushing crowd without, she stood upright and immovable\\nin the middle of the yard, like one on watch. The hood, which she had\\ndropped from her head when she thought her eyes and smile might be of\\nuse to her in the furtherance of her plans, had been drawn over it\\nagain, so that she looked more like a statue in grey than a living,\\nbreathing woman. Yet there was menace in her attitude and a purpose in\\nthe solitary stand she took in that circle of board-girded grass, which\\ncaused a thrill in the breasts of those who looked at her from that\\nchamber of death.\\n\\n\"A mysterious young woman,\" muttered the minister.\\n\\n\"And one that I neither countenance nor understand,\" interpolated Mr.\\nSutherland. \"I have just shown my displeasure at her actions by\\ndismissing her from my house.\"\\n\\nThe coroner gave him a quick look, seemed about to speak, but changed\\nhis mind and turned toward the dead woman.\\n\\n\"We have a sad duty before us,\" said he.\\n\\nThe investigations which followed elicited one or two new facts. First,\\nthat all the doors of the house were found unlocked; and, secondly, that\\nthe constable had been among the first to enter, so that he could vouch\\nthat no disarrangement had been made in the rooms, with the exception of\\nBatsy\\'s removal to the bed.\\n\\nThen, his attention being drawn to the dead woman, he discovered the key\\nin her tightly closed hand.\\n\\n\"Where does this key belong?\" he asked.\\n\\nThey showed him the drawers in the cupboard.\\n\\n\"One is empty,\" remarked Mi. Sutherland. \"If the other is found to be in\\nthe same condition, then her money has been taken. That key she holds\\nshould open both these drawers.\"\\n\\n\"Then let it be made use of at once. It is important that we should know\\nwhether theft has been committed here as well as murder.\" And drawing\\nthe key out, he handed it to Mr. Fenton.\\n\\nThe constable immediately unlocked the drawer and brought it and its\\ncontents to the table.\\n\\n\"No money here,\" said he.\\n\\n\"But papers as good as money,\" announced the doctor. \"See! here are\\ndeeds and more than one valuable bond. I judge she was a richer woman\\nthan any of us knew.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland, meantime, was looking with an air of disappointment into\\nthe now empty drawer.\\n\\n\"Just as I feared,\" said he. \"She has been robbed of her ready money. It\\nwas doubtless in the other drawer.\"\\n\\n\"How came she by the key, then?\"\\n\\n\"That is one of the mysteries of the affair; this murder is by no means\\na simple one. I begin to think we shall find it full of mysteries.\"\\n\\n\"Batsy\\'s death, for instance?\"\\n\\n\"O yes, Batsy! I forgot that she was found dead too.\"\\n\\n\"Without a wound, doctor.\"\\n\\n\"She had heart disease. I doctored her for it. The fright has killed\\nher.\"\\n\\n\"The look of her face confirms that.\"\\n\\n\"Let me see! So it does; but we must have an autopsy to prove it.\"\\n\\n\"I would like to explain before any further measures are taken, how I\\ncame to know that Agatha Webb had money in her house,\" said Mr.\\nSutherland, as they stepped back into the other room. \"Two days ago, as\\nI was sitting with my family at table, old gossip Judy came in. Had Mrs.\\nSutherland been living, this old crone would not have presumed to\\nintrude upon us at mealtime, but as we have no one now to uphold our\\ndignity, this woman rushed into our presence panting with news, and told\\nus all in one breath how she had just come from Mrs. Webb; that Mrs.\\nWebb had money; that she had seen it, she herself; that, going into the\\nhouse as usual without knocking, she had heard Agatha stepping overhead\\nand had gone up; and finding the door of the sitting-room ajar, had\\nlooked in, and seen Agatha crossing the room with her hands full of\\nbills; that these bills were big bills, for she heard Agatha cry, as she\\nlocked them up in the cupboard behind the book-shelves, \\'A thousand\\ndollars! That is too much money to have in one\\'s house\\'; that she, Judy,\\nthought so too, and being frightened at what she had seen, had crept\\naway as silently as she had entered and run away to tell the neighbours.\\nHappily, I was the first she found up that morning, but I have no doubt\\nthat, in spite of my express injunctions, she has since related the news\\nto half the people in town.\"\\n\\n\"Was the young woman down yonder present when Judy told this story?\"\\nasked the coroner, pointing towards the yard.\\n\\nMr. Sutherland pondered. \"Possibly; I do not remember. Frederick was\\nseated at the table with me, and my housekeeper was pouring out the\\ncoffee, but it was early for Miss Page. She has been putting on great\\nairs of late.\"\\n\\n\"Can it be possible he is trying to blind himself to the fact that his\\nson Frederick wishes to marry this girl?\" muttered the clergyman into\\nthe constable\\'s ear.\\n\\nThe constable shook his head. Mr. Sutherland was one of those debonair\\nmen, whose very mildness makes them impenetrable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nA SPOT ON THE LAWN\\n\\n\\nThe coroner, on leaving the house, was followed by Mr. Sutherland. As\\nthe fine figures of the two men appeared on the doorstep, a faint cheer\\nwas heard from the two or three favoured persons who were allowed to\\nlook through the gate. But to this token of welcome neither gentleman\\nresponded by so much as a look, all their attention being engrossed by\\nthe sight of the solitary figure of Miss Page, who still held her stand\\nupon the lawn. Motionless as a statue, but with her eyes fixed upon\\ntheir faces, she awaited their approach. When they were near her she\\nthrust one hand from under her cloak, and pointing to the grass at her\\nfeet, said quietly:\\n\\n\"See this?\"\\n\\nThey hastened towards her and bent down to examine the spot she\\nindicated.\\n\\n\"What do you find there?\" cried Mr. Sutherland, whose eyesight was not\\ngood.\\n\\n\"Blood,\" responded the coroner, plucking up a blade of grass and\\nsurveying it closely.\\n\\n\"Blood,\" echoed Miss Page, with so suggestive a glance that Mr.\\nSutherland stared at her in amazement, not understanding his own\\nemotion.\\n\\n\"How were you able to discern a stain so nearly imperceptible?\" asked\\nthe coroner.\\n\\n\"Imperceptible? It is the only thing I see in the whole yard,\" she\\nretorted, and with a slight bow, which was not without its element of\\nmockery, she turned toward the gate.\\n\\n\"A most unaccountable girl,\" commented the doctor. \"But she is right\\nabout these stains. Abel,\" he called to the man at the gate, \"bring a\\nbox or barrel here and cover up this spot. I don\\'t want it disturbed by\\ntrampling feet.\"\\n\\nAbel started to obey, just as the young girl laid her hand on the gate\\nto open it.\\n\\n\"Won\\'t you help me?\" she asked. \"The crowd is so great they won\\'t let me\\nthrough.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t they?\" The words came from without. \"Just slip out as I slip in,\\nand you\\'ll find a place made for you.\"\\n\\nNot recognising the voice, she hesitated for a moment, but seeing the\\ngate swaying, she pushed against it just as a young man stepped through\\nthe gap. Necessarily they came face to face.\\n\\n\"Ah, it\\'s you,\" he muttered, giving her a sharp glance.\\n\\n\"I do not know you,\" she haughtily declared, and slipped by him with\\nsuch dexterity she was out of the gate before he could respond.\\n\\nBut he only snapped his finger and thumb mockingly at her, and smiled\\nknowingly at Abel, who had lingered to watch the end of this encounter.\\n\\n\"Supple as a willow twig, eh?\" he laughed. \"Well, I have made whistles\\nout of willows before now, and hallo! where did you get that?\"\\n\\nHe was pointing to a rare flower that hung limp and faded from Abel\\'s\\nbuttonhole.\\n\\n\"This? Oh, I found it in the house yonder. It was lying on the floor of\\nthe inner room, almost under Batsy\\'s skirts. Curious sort of flower. I\\nwonder where she got it?\"\\n\\nThe intruder betrayed at once an unaccountable emotion. There was a\\nstrange glitter in his light green eyes that made Abel shift rather\\nuneasily on his feet. \"Was that before this pretty minx you have just\\nlet out came in here with Mr. Sutherland?\"\\n\\n\"O yes; before anyone had started for the hill at all. Why, what has\\nthis young lady got to do with a flower dropped by Batsy?\"\\n\\n\"She? Nothing. Only--and I have never given you bad advice, Abel--don\\'t\\nlet that thing hang any longer from your buttonhole. Put it into an\\nenvelope and keep it, and if you don\\'t hear from me again in regard to\\nit, write me out a fool and forget we were ever chums when little\\nshavers.\"\\n\\nThe man called Abel smiled, took out the flower, and went to cover up\\nthe grass as Dr. Talbot had requested. The stranger took his place at\\nthe gate, toward which the coroner and Mr. Sutherland were now\\nadvancing, with an air that showed his great anxiety to speak with them.\\nHe was the musician whom we saw secretly entering the last-mentioned\\ngentleman\\'s house after the departure of the servants.\\n\\nAs the coroner paused before him he spoke. \"Dr. Talbot,\" said he,\\ndropping his eyes, which were apt to betray his thoughts too plainly,\\n\"you have often promised that you would give me a job if any matter came\\nup where any nice detective work was wanted. Don\\'t you think the time\\nhas come to remember me?\"\\n\\n\"You, Sweetwater? I\\'m afraid the affair is too deep for an inexperienced\\nman\\'s first effort. I shall have to send to Boston for an expert.\\nAnother time, Sweetwater, when the complications are less serious.\"\\n\\nThe young fellow, with a face white as milk, was turning away.\\n\\n\"But you\\'ll let me stay around here?\" he pleaded, pausing and giving the\\nother an imploring look.\\n\\n\"O yes,\" answered the good-natured coroner. \"Fenton will have work\\nenough for you and half a dozen others. Go and tell him I sent you.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" returned the other, his face suddenly losing its aspect of\\nacute disappointment. \"Now I shall see where that flower fell,\" he\\nmurmured.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\n\"BREAKFAST IS SERVED, GENTLEMEN!\"\\n\\n\\nMr. Sutherland returned home. As he entered the broad hall he met his\\nson, Frederick. There was a look on the young man\\'s face such as he had\\nnot seen there in years.\\n\\n\"Father,\" faltered the youth, \"may I have a few words with you?\"\\n\\nThe father nodded kindly, though it is likely he would have much\\npreferred his breakfast; and the young man led him into a little\\nsitting-room littered with the faded garlands and other tokens of the\\npreceding night\\'s festivities.\\n\\n\"I have an apology to make,\" Frederick began, \"or rather, I have your\\nforgiveness to ask. For years\" he went on, stumbling over his words,\\nthough he gave no evidence of a wish to restrain them--\"for years I have\\ngone contrariwise to your wishes and caused my mother\\'s heart to ache\\nand you to wish I had never been born to be a curse to you and her.\"\\n\\nHe had emphasised the word mother, and spoke altogether with force and\\ndeep intensity. Mr. Sutherland stood petrified; he had long ago given up\\nthis lad as lost.\\n\\n\"I--I wish to change. I wish to be as great a pride to you as I have\\nbeen a shame and a dishonour. I may not succeed at once; but I am in\\nearnest, and if you will give me your hand--\"\\n\\nThe old man\\'s arms were round the young man\\'s shoulders at once.\\n\\n\"Frederick!\" he cried, \"my Frederick!\"\\n\\n\"Do not make me too much ashamed,\" murmured the youth, very pale and\\nstrangely discomposed. \"With no excuse for my past, I suffer intolerable\\napprehension in regard to my future, lest my good intentions should fail\\nor my self-control not hold out. But the knowledge that you are\\nacquainted with my resolve, and regard it with an undeserved sympathy,\\nmay suffice to sustain me, and I should certainly be a base poltroon if\\nI should disappoint you or her twice.\"\\n\\nHe paused, drew himself from his father\\'s arms, and glanced almost\\nsolemnly out of the window. \"I swear that I will henceforth act as if\\nshe were still alive and watching me.\"\\n\\nThere was strange intensity in his manner. Mr. Sutherland regarded him\\nwith amazement. He had seen him in every mood natural to a reckless man,\\nbut never in so serious a one, never with a look of awe or purpose in\\nhis face. It gave him quite a new idea of Frederick.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" the young man went on, raising his right hand, but not removing\\nhis eyes from the distant prospect on which they were fixed, \"I swear\\nthat I will henceforth do nothing to discredit her memory. Outwardly and\\ninwardly, I will act as though her eye were still upon me and she could\\nagain suffer grief at my failures or thrill with pleasure at my\\nsuccess.\"\\n\\nA portrait of Mrs. Sutherland, painted when Frederick was a lad of ten,\\nhung within a few feet of him as he spoke. He did not glance at it, but\\nMr. Sutherland did, and with a look as if he expected to behold a\\nresponsive light beam from those pathetic features.\\n\\n\"She loved you very dearly,\" was his slow and earnest comment. \"We have\\nboth loved you much more deeply than you have ever seemed to realise,\\nFrederick.\"\\n\\n\"I believe it,\" responded the young man, turning with an expression of\\ncalm resolve to meet his father\\'s eye. \"As proof that I am no longer\\ninsensible to your affection, I have made up my mind to forego for your\\nsake one of the dearest wishes of my heart. Father\" he hesitated before\\nhe spoke the word, but he spoke it firmly at last,--\"am I right in\\nthinking you would not like Miss Page for a daughter?\"\\n\\n\"Like my housekeeper\\'s niece to take the place in this house once\\noccupied by Marietta Sutherland? Frederick, I have always thought too\\nwell of you to believe you would carry your forgetfulness of me so far\\nas that, even when I saw that you were influenced by her attractions.\"\\n\\n\"You did not do justice to my selfishness, father. I did mean to marry\\nher, but I have given up living solely for myself, and she could never\\nhelp me to live for others. Father, Amabel Page must not remain in this\\nhouse to cause division between you and me.\"\\n\\n\"I have already intimated to her the desirability of her quitting a home\\nwhere she is no longer respected,\" the old gentleman declared. \"She\\nleaves on the 10.45 train. Her conduct this morning at the house of Mrs.\\nWebb--who perhaps you do not know was most cruelly and foully murdered\\nlast night--was such as to cause comment and make her an undesirable\\nadjunct to any gentleman\\'s family.\"\\n\\nFrederick paled. Something in these words had caused him a great shock.\\nMr. Sutherland was fond enough to believe that it was the news of this\\nextraordinary woman\\'s death. But his son\\'s words, as soon as he could\\nfind any, showed that his mind was running on Amabel, whom he perhaps\\nhad found it difficult to connect even in the remotest way with crime.\\n\\n\"She at this place of death? How could that be? Who would take a young\\ngirl there?\"\\n\\nThe father, experiencing, perhaps, more compassion for this\\nsoon-to-be-disillusioned lover than he thought it incumbent upon him to\\nshow, answered shortly, but without any compromise of the unhappy truth:\\n\\n\"She went; she was not taken. No one, not even myself, could keep her\\nback after she had heard that a murder had been committed in the town.\\nShe even intruded into the house; and when ordered out of the room of\\ndeath took up her stand in the yard in front, where she remained until\\nshe had the opportunity of pointing out to us a stain of blood on the\\ngrass, which might otherwise have escaped our attention.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible!\" Frederick\\'s eye was staring; he looked like a man struck\\ndumb by surprise or fear. \"Amabel do this? You are mocking me, sir, or I\\nmay be dreaming, which may the good God grant.\"\\n\\nHis father, who had not looked for so much emotion, eyed his son in\\nsurprise, which rapidly changed to alarm as the young man faltered and\\nfell back against the wall.\\n\\n\"You are ill, Frederick; you are really ill. Let me call down Mrs.\\nHarcourt. But no, I cannot summon her. She is this girl\\'s aunt.\"\\n\\nFrederick made an effort and stood up.\\n\\n\"Do not call anybody,\" he entreated. \"I expect to suffer some in casting\\nthis fascinating girl out of my heart. Ultimately I will conquer the\\nweakness; indeed I will. As for her interest in Mrs. Webb\\'s death\"--how\\nlow his voice sank and how he trembled!\" she may have been better\\nfriends with her than we had any reason to suppose. I can think of no\\nother motive for her conduct. Admiration for Mrs. Webb and horror---\"\\n\\n\"Breakfast is served, gentlemen!\" cried a thrilling voice behind them.\\nAmabel Page stood smiling in the doorway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\n\"MARRY ME\"\\n\\n\\n\"Wait a moment, I must speak to you.\" It was Amabel who was holding\\nFrederick back. She had caught him by the arm as he was about leaving\\nthe room with his father, and he felt himself obliged to stop and\\nlisten.\\n\\n\"I start for Springfield to-day,\" she announced. \"I have another\\nrelative there living at the house. When shall I have the pleasure of\\nseeing you in my new home?\"\\n\\n\"Never.\" It was said regretfully, and yet with a certain brusqueness,\\noccasioned perhaps by over-excited feeling. \"Hard as it is for me to say\\nit, Amabel, it is but just for me to tell you that after our parting\\nhere to-day we will meet only as strangers. Friendship between us would\\nbe mockery, and any closer relationship has become impossible.\"\\n\\nIt had cost him an immense effort to say these words, and he expected,\\nfondly expected, I must admit, to see her colour change and her head\\ndroop. But instead of this she looked at him steadily for a moment, then\\nslipped her hand down his arm till she reached his palm, which she\\npressed with sudden warmth, drawing him into the room as she did so, and\\nshutting the door behind them. He was speechless, for she never had\\nlooked so handsome or so glowing. Instead of showing depression or\\nhumiliation even, she confronted him with a smile more dangerous than\\nany display of grief, for it contained what it had hitherto lacked,\\npositive and irresistible admiration. Her words were equally dangerous.\\n\\n\"I kiss your hand, as the Spaniards say.\" And she almost did so, with a\\nbend of her head, which just allowed him to catch a glimpse of two\\nstartling dimples.\\n\\nHe was astounded. He thought he knew this woman well, but at this moment\\nshe was as incomprehensible to him as if he had never made a study of\\nher caprices and sought an explanation for her ever-shifting\\nexpressions.\\n\\n\"I am sensible of the honour,\" said he, \"but hardly understand how I\\nhave earned it.\"\\n\\nStill that incomprehensible look of admiration continued to illumine her\\nface.\\n\\n\"I did not know I could ever think so well of you,\" she declared. \"If\\nyou do not take care, I shall end by loving you some day.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" he ejaculated, his face contracting with sudden pain; \"your love,\\nthen, is but a potentiality. Very well, Amabel, keep it so and you will\\nbe spared much misery. As for me, who have not been as wise as you---\"\\n\\n\"Frederick!\" She had come so near he did not have the strength to\\nfinish. Her face, with its indefinable charm, was raised to his, as she\\ndropped these words one by one from her lips in lingering cadence:\\n\"Frederick--do you love me, then, so very much?\"\\n\\nHe was angry; possibly because he felt his resolution failing him. \"You\\nknow!\" he hotly began, stepping back. Then with a sudden burst of\\nfeeling, that was almost like prayer, he resumed: \"Do not tempt me,\\nAmabel. I have trouble enough, without lamenting the failure of my first\\nsteadfast purpose.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" she said, stopping where she was, but drawing him toward her by\\nevery witchery of which her mobile features were capable; \"your generous\\nimpulse has strengthened into a purpose, has it? Well, I\\'m not worth it,\\nFrederick.\"\\n\\nMore and more astounded, understanding her less than ever, but charmed\\nby looks that would have moved an anchorite, he turned his head away in\\na vain attempt to escape an influence that was so rapidly undermining\\nhis determination.\\n\\nShe saw the movement, recognised the weakness it bespoke, and in the\\ntriumph of her heart allowed a low laugh to escape her.\\n\\nHer voice, as I have before said, was unmusical though effective; but\\nher laugh was deliciously sweet, especially when it was restrained to a\\nmere ripple, as now.\\n\\n\"You will come to Springfield soon,\" she avowed, slipping from before\\nhim so as to leave the way to the door open.\\n\\n\"Amabel!\" His voice was strangely husky, and the involuntary opening and\\nshutting of his hands revealed the emotion under which he was labouring.\\n\"Do you love me? You have acknowledged it now and then, but always as if\\nyou did not mean it. Now you acknowledge that you may some day, and this\\ntime as if you did mean it. What is the truth? Tell me, without coquetry\\nor dissembling, for I am in dead earnest, and---\" He paused, choked, and\\nturned toward the window where but a few minutes before he had taken\\nthat solemn oath. The remembrance of it seemed to come back with the\\nmovement. Flushing with a new agitation, he wheeled upon her sharply.\\n\"No, no,\" he prayed, \"say nothing. If you swore you did not love me I\\nshould not believe it, and if you swore that you did I should only find\\nit harder to repeat what must again be said, that a union between us can\\nnever take place. I have given my solemn promise to---\"\\n\\n\"Well, well. Why do you stop? Am I so hard to talk to that the words\\nwill not leave your lips?\"\\n\\n\"I have promised my father I will never marry you. He feels that he has\\ngrounds of complaint against you, and as I owe him everything---\"\\n\\nHe stopped amazed. She was looking at him intently, that same low laugh\\nstill on her lips.\\n\\n\"Tell the truth,\" she whispered. \"I know to what extent you consider\\nyour father\\'s wishes. You think you ought not to marry me after what\\ntook place last night. Frederick, I like you for this evidence of\\nconsideration on your part, but do not struggle too relentlessly with\\nyour conscience. I can forgive much more in you than you think, and if\\nyou really love me---\"\\n\\n\"Stop! Let us understand each other.\" He had turned mortally pale, and\\nmet her eyes with something akin to alarm. \"What do you allude to in\\nspeaking of last night? I did not know there was anything said by us in\\nour talk together---\"\\n\\n\"I do not allude to our talk.\"\\n\\n\"Or--or in the one dance we had---\"\\n\\n\"Frederick, a dance is innocent.\"\\n\\nThe word seemed to strike him with the force of a blow.\\n\\n\"Innocent,\" he repeated, \"innocent?\" becoming paler still as the full\\nweight of her meaning broke gradually upon him.\\n\\n\"I followed you into town,\" she whispered, coming closer, and breathing\\nthe words into his ear. \"But what I saw you do there will not prevent me\\nfrom obeying you if you say: \\'Follow me wherever I go, Amabel;\\nhenceforth our lives are one.\\'\"\\n\\n\"My God!\"\\n\\nIt was all he said, but it seemed to create a gulf between them. In the\\nsilence that followed, the evil spirit latent beneath her beauty began\\nto make itself evident even in the smile which no longer called into\\nview the dimples which belong to guileless mirth, while upon his face,\\nafter the first paralysing effect of her words had passed, there\\nappeared an expression of manly resistance that betrayed a virtue which\\nas yet had never appeared in his selfish and altogether reckless life.\\n\\nThat this was more than a passing impulse he presently made evident by\\nlifting his hand and pushing her slowly back.\\n\\n\"I do not know what you saw me do,\" said he; \"but whatever it was, it\\ncan make no difference in our relations.\"\\n\\nHer whisper, which had been but a breath before, became scarcely\\naudible.\\n\\n\"I did not pause at the gate you entered,\" said she. \"I went in after\\nyou.\"\\n\\nA gasp of irresistible feeling escaped him, but he did not take his eyes\\nfrom her face.\\n\\n\"It was a long time before you came out,\" she went on, \"but previous to\\nthat time the shade of a certain window was thrust aside, and---\"\\n\\n\"Hush!\" he commanded, in uncontrollable passion, pressing his hand with\\nimpulsive energy against her mouth. \"Not another word of that, or I\\nshall forget you are a woman or that I have ever loved you.\"\\n\\nHer eyes, which were all she had remaining to plead with, took on a\\npeculiar look of quiet satisfaction, and power. Seeing it, he let his\\nhand fall and for the first time began to regard her with anything but a\\nlover\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"I was the only person in sight at that time,\" she continued. \"You have\\nnothing to fear from the world at large.\"\\n\\n\"Fear?\"\\n\\nThe word made its own echo; she had no need to emphasise it even by a\\nsmile. But she watched him as it sunk into his consciousness with an\\nintentness it took all his strength to sustain. Suddenly her bearing and\\nexpression changed. The few remains of sweetness in her face vanished,\\nand even the allurement which often lasts when the sweetness is gone,\\ndisappeared in the energy which now took possession of her whole\\nthreatening and inflexible personality.\\n\\n\"Marry me,\" she cried, \"or I will proclaim you to be the murderer of\\nAgatha Webb.\"\\n\\nShe had seen the death of love in his eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\n\"A DEVIL THAT UNDERSTANDS MEN\"\\n\\n\\nFrederick Sutherland was a man of finer mental balance than he himself,\\nperhaps, had ever realised. After the first few moments of stupefaction\\nfollowing the astounding alternative which had been given him, he broke\\nout with the last sentence she probably expected to hear:\\n\\n\"What do you hope from a marriage with me, that to attain your wishes\\nyou thus sacrifice every womanly instinct?\"\\n\\nShe met him on his own ground.\\n\\n\"What do I hope?\" She actually glowed with the force of her secret\\ndesire. \"Can you ask a poor girl like me, born in a tenement house, but\\nwith tastes and ambitions such as are usually only given to those who\\ncan gratify them? I want to be the rich Mr. Sutherland\\'s daughter;\\nacknowledged or unacknowledged, the wife of one who can enter any house\\nin Boston as an equal. With a position like that I can rise to anything.\\nI feel that I have the natural power and aptitude. I have felt it since\\nI was a small child.\"\\n\\n\"And for that---\" he began.\\n\\n\"And for that,\" she broke in, \"I am quite willing to overlook a blot on\\nyour record. Confident that you will never repeat the risk of last\\nnight, I am ready to share the burden of your secret through life. If\\nyou treat me well, I am sure I can make that burden light for you.\"\\n\\nWith a quick flush and an increase of self-assertion, probably not\\nanticipated by her, he faced the daring girl with a desperate resolution\\nthat showed how handsome he could be if his soul once got control of his\\nbody.\\n\\n\"Woman,\" he cried, \"they were right; you are little less than a devil.\"\\n\\nDid she regard it as a compliment? Her smile would seem to say so.\\n\\n\"A devil that understands men,\" she answered, with that slow dip of her\\ndimples that made her smile so dangerous. \"You will not hesitate long\\nover this matter; a week, perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not hesitate at all. Seeing you as you are, makes my course\\neasy. You will never share any burden with me as my wife.\"\\n\\nStill she was not abashed.\\n\\n\"It is a pity,\" she whispered; \"it would have saved you such unnecessary\\nstruggle. But a week is not long to wait. I am certain of you then. This\\nday week at twelve o\\'clock, Frederick.\"\\n\\nHe seized her by the arm, and lost to everything but his rage, shook her\\nwith a desperate hand.\\n\\n\"Do you mean it?\" he cried, a sudden horror showing itself in his face,\\nnotwithstanding his efforts to conceal it.\\n\\n\"I mean it so much,\" she assured him, \"that before I came home just now\\nI paid a visit to the copse over the way. A certain hollow tree, where\\nyou and I have held more than one tryst, conceals within its depths a\\npackage containing over one thousand dollars. Frederick, I hold your\\nlife in my hands.\"\\n\\nThe grasp with which he held her relaxed; a mortal despair settled upon\\nhis features, and recognising the impossibility of further concealing\\nthe effect of her words upon him, he sank into a chair and covered his\\nface with his hands. She viewed him with an air of triumph, which\\nbrought back some of her beauty. When she spoke it was to say:\\n\\n\"If you wish to join me in Springfield before the time I have set, well\\nand good. I am willing that the time of our separation should be\\nshortened, but it must not be lengthened by so much as a day. Now, if\\nyou will excuse me, I will go and pack my trunks.\"\\n\\nHe shuddered; her voice penetrated him to the quick.\\n\\nDrawing herself up, she looked down on him with a strange mixture of\\npassion and elation.\\n\\n\"You need fear no indiscretion on my part, so long as our armistice\\nlasts,\" said she. \"No one can drag the truth from me while any hope\\nremains of your doing your duty by me in the way I have suggested.\"\\n\\nAnd still he did not move.\\n\\n\"Frederick?\"\\n\\nWas it her voice that was thus murmuring his name? Can the tiger snarl\\none moment and fawn the next?\\n\\n\"Frederick, I have a final word to say--a last farewell. Up to this hour\\nI have endured your attentions, or, let us say, accepted them, for I\\nalways found you handsome and agreeable, if not the master of my heart.\\nBut now it is love that I feel, love; and love with me is no fancy, but\\na passion--do you hear?--a passion which will make life a heaven or hell\\nfor the man who has inspired it. You should have thought of this when\\nyou opposed me.\"\\n\\nAnd with a look in which love and hatred contended for mastery, she bent\\nand imprinted a kiss upon his forehead. Next moment she was gone.\\n\\nOr so he thought. But when, after an interval of nameless recoil, he\\nrose and attempted to stagger from the place, he discovered that she had\\nbeen detained in the hall by two or three men who had just come in by\\nthe front door.\\n\\n\"Is this Miss Page?\" they were asking.\\n\\n\"Yes, I am Miss Page--Amabel Page\" she replied with suave politeness.\\n\"If you have any business with me, state it quickly, for I am about to\\nleave town.\"\\n\\n\"That is what we wish to prevent,\" declared a tall, thin young man who\\nseemed to take the lead. \"Till the inquest has been held over the\\nremains of Mrs. Webb, Coroner Talbot wishes you to regard yourself as a\\npossible witness.\"\\n\\n\"Me?\" she cried, with an admirable gesture of surprise and a wide\\nopening of her brown eyes that made her look like an astonished child.\\n\"What have I got to do with it?\"\\n\\n\"You pointed out a certain spot of blood on the grass, and--well, the\\ncoroner\\'s orders have to be obeyed, miss. You cannot leave the town\\nwithout running the risk of arrest\"\\n\\n\"Then I will stay in it,\" she smiled. \"I have no liking for arrests,\"\\nand the glint of her eye rested for a moment on Frederick. \"Mr.\\nSutherland,\" she continued, as that gentleman appeared at the\\ndining-room door, \"I shall have to impose upon your hospitality for a\\nfew days longer. These men here inform me that my innocent interest in\\npointing out to you that spot of blood on Mrs. Webb\\'s lawn has awakened\\nsome curiosity, and that I am wanted as a witness by the coroner.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland, with a quick stride, lessened the distance between\\nhimself and these unwelcome intruders. \"The coroner\\'s wishes are\\nparamount just now,\" said he, but the look he gave his son was not soon\\nforgotten by the spectators.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\nA GRAND WOMAN\\n\\n\\nThere was but one topic discussed in the country-side that day, and that\\nwas the life and character of Agatha Webb.\\n\\nHer history had not been a happy one. She and Philemon had come from\\nPortchester some twenty or more years before to escape the sorrows\\nassociated with their native town. They had left behind them six small\\ngraves in Portchester churchyard; but though evidences of their\\naffliction were always to be seen in the countenances of either, they\\nhad entered with so much purpose into the life of their adopted town\\nthat they had become persons of note there till Philemon\\'s health began\\nto fail, when Agatha quit all outside work and devoted herself\\nexclusively to him. Of her character and winsome personality we can\\ngather some idea from the various conversations carried on that day from\\nPortchester Green to the shipyards in Sutherlandtown.\\n\\nIn Deacon Brainerd\\'s cottage, the discussion was concerning Agatha\\'s\\nlack of vanity; a virtue not very common at that time among the women of\\nthis busy seaport.\\n\\n\"For a woman so handsome,\" the good deacon was saying \"(and I think I\\ncan safely call her the finest-featured woman who ever trod these\\nstreets), she showed as little interest in dress as anyone I ever knew.\\nCalico at home and calico at church, yet she looked as much of a lady in\\nher dark-sprigged gowns as Mrs. Webster in her silks or Mrs. Parsons in\\nher thousand-dollar sealskin.\"\\n\\nAs this was a topic within the scope of his eldest daughter\\'s\\nintelligence she at once spoke up: \"I never thought she needed to dress\\nso plainly. I don\\'t believe in such a show of poverty myself. If one is\\ntoo poor to go decent, all right; but they say she had more money than\\nmost anyone in town. I wonder who is going to get the benefit of it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, Philemon, of course; that is, as long as he lives. He doubtless\\nhad the making of it.\"\\n\\n\"Is it true that he\\'s gone clean out of his head since her death?\"\\ninterposed a neighbour who had happened in.\\n\\n\"So they say. I believe widow Jones has taken him into her house.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think,\" asked a second daughter with becoming hesitation, \"that\\nhe had anything to do with her death? Some of the neighbours say he\\nstruck her while in one of his crazy fits, while others declare she was\\nkilled by some stranger, equally old and almost as infirm.\"\\n\\n\"We won\\'t discuss the subject,\" objected the deacon. \"Time will show who\\nrobbed us of the greatest-hearted and most capable woman in these\\nparts.\"\\n\\n\"And will time show who killed Batsy?\" It was a morsel of a girl who\\nspoke; the least one of the family, but the brightest. \"I\\'m sorry for\\nBatsy; she always gave me cookies when I went to see Mrs. Webb.\"\\n\\n\"Batsy was a good girl for a Swede,\" allowed the deacon\\'s wife, who had\\nnot spoken till now. \"When she first came into town on the spars of that\\nwrecked ship we all remember, there was some struggle between Agatha and\\nme as to which of us should have her. But I didn\\'t like the task of\\nteaching her the name of every pot and pan she had to use in the\\nkitchen, so I gave her up to Agatha; and it was fortunate I did, for\\nI\\'ve never been able to understand her talk to this day.\"\\n\\n\"I could talk with her right well,\" lisped the little one. \"She never\\ncalled things by their Swedish names unless she was worried; and I never\\nworried her.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder if she would have worshipped the ground under your feet, as\\nshe did that under Agatha\\'s?\" asked the deacon, eying his wife with just\\nthe suspicion of a malicious twinkle in his eye.\\n\\n\"I am not the greatest-hearted and most capable woman in town,\" retorted\\nhis wife, clicking her needles as she went on knitting.\\n\\nIn Mr. Sprague\\'s house on the opposite side of the road, Squire Fisher\\nwas relating some old tales of bygone Portchester days. \"I knew Agatha\\nwhen she was a girl,\" he avowed. \"She had the grandest manners and the\\nmost enchanting smile of any rich or poor man\\'s daughter between the\\ncoast and Springfield. She did not dress in calico then. She wore the\\ngayest clothes her father could buy. her, and old Jacob was not without\\nmeans to make his daughter the leading figure in town. How we young\\nfellows did adore her, and what lengths we went to win one of her\\nglorious smiles! Two of us, John and James Zabel, have lived bachelors\\nfor her sake to this very day; but I hadn\\'t courage enough for that; I\\nmarried and\"--something between a sigh and a chuckle filled out the\\nsentence.\\n\\n\"What made Philemon carry off the prize? His good looks?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, or his good luck. It wasn\\'t his snap; of that you may be sure.\\nJames Zabel had the snap, and he was her first choice, too, but he got\\ninto some difficulty--I never knew just what it was, but it was regarded\\nas serious at the time--and that match was broken off. Afterwards she\\nmarried Philemon. You see, I was out of it altogether; had never been in\\nit, perhaps; but there were three good years of my life in which I\\nthought of little else than Agatha. I admired her spirit, you see. There\\nwas something more taking in her ways than in her beauty, wonderful as\\nthat was. She ruled us with a rod of iron, and yet we worshipped her. I\\nhave wondered to see her so meek of late. I never thought she would be\\nsatisfied with a brick-floored cottage and a husband of failing wits.\\nBut no one, to my knowledge, has ever heard a complaint from her lips;\\nand the dignity of her afflicted wife-hood has far transcended the\\nhaughtiness of those days when she had but to smile to have all the\\nyouth of Portchester at her feet.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose it was the loss of so many children that reconciled her to a\\nquiet life. A woman cannot close the eyes of six children, one after the\\nother, without some modification taking place in her character.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she and Philemon have been unfortunate; but she was a splendid\\nlooking girl, boys. I never see such grand-looking women now.\"\\n\\nIn a little one-storied cottage on the hillside a woman was nursing a\\nbaby and talking at the same time of Agatha Webb.\\n\\n\"I shall never forget the night my first baby fell sick,\" she faltered;\\n\"I was just out of bed myself, and having no nearer neighbours then than\\nnow, I was all alone on the hillside, Alec being away at sea. I was too\\nyoung to know much about sickness, but something told me that I must\\nhave help before morning or my baby would die. Though I could just walk\\nacross the floor, I threw a shawl around me, took my baby in my arms,\\nand opened the door. A blinding gust of rain blew in. A terrible storm\\nwas raging and I had not noticed it, I was so taken up with the child.\\n\\n\"I could not face that gale. Indeed, I was so weak I fell on my knees as\\nit struck me and became dripping wet before I could drag myself inside.\\nThe baby began to moan and everything was turning dark before me, when I\\nheard a strong, sweet voice cry out in the roadway:\\n\\n\"\\'Is there room in this house for me till the storm has blown by? I\\ncannot see my way down the hillside.\\'\\n\\n\"With a bursting heart I looked up. A woman was standing in the doorway,\\nwith the look of an angel in her eyes. I did not know her, but her face\\nwas one to bring comfort to the saddest heart. Holding up my baby, I\\ncried:\\n\\n\"\\'My baby is dying; I tried to go for the doctor, but my knees bent\\nunder me. Help me, as you are a mother--I--- \\'\\n\\n\"I must have fallen again, for the next thing I remember I was lying by\\nthe hearth, looking up into her face, which was bending over me. She was\\nwhite as the rag I had tied about my baby\\'s throat, and by the way her\\nbreast heaved she was either very much frightened or very sorry.\\n\\n\"\\'I wish you had the help of anyone else,\\' said she. \\'Babies perish in\\nmy arms and wither at my breast. I cannot touch it, much as I yearn to.\\nBut let me see its face; perhaps I can tell you what is the matter with\\nit.\\'\\n\\n\"I showed her the baby\\'s face, and she bent over it, trembling very\\nmuch, almost as much indeed as myself.\\n\\n\"\\'It is very sick,\\' she said, \\'but if you will use the remedies I\\nadvise, I think you can save it.\\' And she told me what to do, and helped\\nme all she could; but she did not lay a finger on the little darling,\\nthough from the way she watched it I saw that her heart was set on his\\ngetting better. And he did; in an hour he was sleeping peacefully, and\\nthe terrible weight was gone from my heart and from hers. When the storm\\nstopped, and she could leave the house, she gave me a kiss; but the look\\nshe gave him meant more than kisses. God must have forgotten her\\ngoodness to me that night when He let her die so pitiable a death.\"\\n\\nAt the minister\\'s house they were commenting upon the look of serenity\\nobservable in her dead face.\\n\\n\"I have known her for thirty years,\" her pastor declared, \"and never\\nbefore have I seen her wear a look of real peace. It is wonderful,\\nconsidering the circumstances. Do you think she was so weary of her\\nlife\\'s long struggle that she hailed any release from it, even that of\\nviolence?\"\\n\\nA young man, a lawyer, visiting them from New York, was the only one to\\nanswer.\\n\\n\"I never saw the woman you are talking about,\" said he, \"and know\\nnothing of the circumstances of her death beyond what you have told me.\\nBut from the very incongruity between her expression and the violent\\nnature of her death, I argue that there are depths to this crime which\\nhave not yet been sounded.\"\\n\\n\"What depths? It is a simple case of murder followed by theft. To be\\nsure we do not yet know the criminal, but money was his motive; that is\\nclear enough.\"\\n\\n\"Are you ready to wager that that is all there is to it?\"\\n\\nThis was a startling proposition to the minister.\\n\\n\"You forget my cloth,\" said he.\\n\\nThe young man smiled. \"That is true. Pardon me. I was only anxious to\\nshow how strong my conviction was against any such easy explanation of a\\ncrime marked by such contradictory features.\"\\n\\nTwo children on the Portchester road were exchanging boyish confidences.\\n\\n\"Do you know what I think about it?\" asked one.\\n\\n\"Naw! How should I?\"\\n\\n\"Wall, I think old Mrs. Webb got the likes of what she sent. Don\\'t you\\nknow she had six children once, and that she killed every one of them?\"\\n\\n\"Killed\\'em--she?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I heard her tell granny once all about it. She said there was a\\nblight on her house--I don\\'t know what that is; but I guess it\\'s\\nsomething big and heavy--and that it fell on every one of her children,\\nas fast as they came, and killed \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'m glad I ben\\'t her child.\"\\n\\nVery different were the recollections interchanged between two\\nmiddle-aged Portchester women.\\n\\n\"She was drinking tea at my house when her sister Sairey came running in\\nwith the news that the baby she had left at home wasn\\'t quite right.\\nThat was her first child, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, for I was with her when that baby came,\" broke in the other,\\n\"and such joy as she showed when they told her it was alive and well I\\nnever saw. I do not know why she didn\\'t expect it to be alive, but she\\ndidn\\'t, and her happiness was just wonderful to see.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she didn\\'t enjoy it long. The poor little fellow died young. But\\nI was telling you of the night when she first heard he was ailing.\\nPhilemon had been telling a good story, and we were all laughing, when\\nSairey came in. I can see Agatha now. She always had the most brilliant\\neyes in the county, but that day they were superbly dazzling. They\\nchanged, though, at the sight of Sairey\\'s face, and she jumped to meet\\nher just as if she knew what Sairey was going to say before ever a word\\nleft her lips. \\'My baby!\\' (I can hear her yet.) \\'Something is the matter\\nwith the baby!\\' And though Sairey made haste to tell her that he was\\nonly ailing and not at all ill, she turned upon Philemon with a look\\nnone of us ever quite understood; he changed so completely under it,\\njust as she had under Sairey\\'s; and to neither did the old happiness\\never return, for the child died within a week, and when the next came it\\ndied also, and the next, till six small innocents lay buried in yonder\\nold graveyard.\"\\n\\n\"I know; and sad enough it was too, especially as she and Philemon were\\nboth fond of children. Well, well, the ways of Providence are past\\nrinding out! And now she is gone and Philemon---\"\\n\\n\"Ah, he\\'ll follow her soon; he can\\'t live without Agatha.\"\\n\\nNearer home, the old sexton was chattering about the six gravestones\\nraised in Portchester churchyard to these six dead infants. He had been\\nsent there to choose a spot in which to lay the mother, and was full of\\nthe shock it gave him to see that line of little stones, telling of a\\npast with which the good people of Sutherlandtown found it hard to\\nassociate Philemon and Agatha Webb.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a digger of graves,\" he mused, half to himself and half to his old\\nwife watching him from the other side of the hearthstone. \"I spend a\\ngood quarter of my time in the churchyard; but when I saw those six\\nlittle mounds, and read the inscriptions over them, I couldn\\'t help\\nfeeling queer. Think of this! On the first tiny headstone I read these\\nwords:\"\\n\\n  STEPHEN,\\n\\n  Son of Philemon and Agatha Webb,\\n\\n  Died, Aged Six Weeks.\\n\\n  God be merciful to me a sinner!\\n\\n\"Now what does that mean? Did you ever hear anyone say?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" was his old wife\\'s answer. \"Perhaps she was one of those Calvinist\\nfolks who believe babies go to hell if they are not baptised.\"\\n\\n\"But her children were all baptised. I\\'ve been told so; some of them\\nbefore she was well out of her bed. \\'God be merciful to me a sinner!\\'\\nAnd the chick not six weeks old! Something queer about that, dame, if it\\ndid happen more than thirty years ago.\"\\n\\n\"What did you see over the grave of the child who was killed in her arms\\nby lightning?\"\\n\\n\"This:\\n\\n\"\\'And he was not, for God took him.\\'\"\\n\\nFarmer Waite had but one word to say:\\n\\n\"She came to me when my Sissy had the smallpox; the only person in town\\nwho would enter my doors. More than that; when Sissy was up and I went\\nto pay the doctor\\'s bill I found it had been settled. I did not know\\nthen who had enough money and compassion to do this for me; now I do.\"\\n\\nMany an act of kindness which had been secretly performed in that town\\nduring the last twenty years came to light on that day, the most notable\\nof which was the sending of a certain young lad to school and his\\nsubsequent education as a minister.\\n\\nBut other memories of a sweeter and more secret nature still came up\\nlikewise, among them the following:\\n\\nA young girl, who was of a very timid but deeply sensitive nature, had\\nbeen urged into an engagement with a man she did not like. Though the\\nconflict this occasioned her and the misery which accompanied it were\\napparent to everybody, nobody stirred in her behalf but Agatha. She went\\nto see her, and, though it was within a fortnight of the wedding, she\\ndid not hesitate to advise the girl to give him up, and when the poor\\nchild said she lacked the courage, Agatha herself went to the man and\\nurged him into a display of generosity which saved the poor, timid thing\\nfrom a life of misery. They say this was no easy task for Agatha, and\\nthat the man was sullen for a year. But the girl\\'s gratitude was\\nboundless.\\n\\nOf her daring, which was always on the side of right and justice, the\\nstories were numerous; so were the accounts, mostly among the women, of\\nher rare tenderness and sympathy for the weak and the erring. Never was\\na man talked to as she talked to Jake Cobleigh the evening after he\\nstruck his mother, and if she had been in town on the day when Clarissa\\nMayhew ran away with that Philadelphia adventurer many said it would\\nnever have happened, for no girl could stand the admonition, or resist\\nthe pleading, of this childless mother.\\n\\nIt was reserved for Mr. Halliday and Mr. Sutherland to talk of her\\nmental qualities. Her character was so marked and her manner so simple\\nthat few gave attention to the intellect that was the real basis of her\\npower. The two mentioned gentlemen, however, appreciated her to the\\nfull, and it was while listening to their remarks that Frederick was\\nsuddenly startled by some one saying to him:\\n\\n\"You are the only person in town who have nothing to say about Agatha\\nWebb. Didn\\'t you ever exchange any words with her?--for I can hardly\\nbelieve you could have met her eye to eye without having some remark to\\nmake about her beauty or her influence.\"\\n\\nThe speaker was Agnes Halliday, who had come in with her father for a\\nsocial chat. She was one of Frederick\\'s earliest playmates, but one with\\nwhom he had never assimilated and who did not like him. He knew this, as\\ndid everyone else in town, and it was with some hesitation he turned to\\nanswer her.\\n\\n\"I have but one recollection,\" he began, and for the moment got no\\nfarther, for in turning his head to address his young guest he had\\nallowed his gaze to wander through the open window by which she sat,\\ninto the garden beyond, where Amabel could be seen picking flowers. As\\nhe spoke, Amabel lifted her face with one of her suggestive looks. She\\nhad doubtless heard Miss Halliday\\'s remark.\\n\\nRecovering himself with an effort, he repeated his words: \"I have but\\none recollection of Mrs. Webb that I can give you. Years ago when I was\\na lad I was playing on the green with several other boys. We had had\\nsome dispute about a lost ball, and I was swearing angrily and loud when\\nI suddenly perceived before me the tall form and compassionate face of\\nMrs. Webb. She was dressed in her usual simple way, and had a basket on\\nher arm, but she looked so superior to any other woman I had ever met\\nthat I did not know whether to hide my face in her skirts or to follow\\nmy first impulse and run away. She saw the emotion she had aroused, and\\nlifting up my face by the chin, she said: \\'Little boy, I have buried six\\nchildren, all of them younger than you, and now my husband and myself\\nlive alone. Often and often have I wished that one at least of these\\ndarling infants might have been spared us. But had God given me the\\nchoice of having them die young and innocent, or of growing up to swear\\nas I have heard you to-day, I should have prayed God to take them, as He\\ndid. You have a mother. Do not break her heart by taking in vain the\\nname of the God she reveres.\\' And with that she kissed me, and, strange\\nas it may seem to you, in whatever folly or wickedness I have indulged,\\nI have never made use of an oath from that day to this--and I thank God\\nfor it.\"\\n\\nThere was such unusual feeling in his voice, a feeling that none had\\never suspected him capable of before, that Miss Halliday regarded him\\nwith astonishment and quite forgot to indulge in her usual banter. Even\\nthe gentlemen sat still, and there was a momentary silence, through\\nwhich there presently broke the incongruous sound of a shrill and\\nmocking laugh.\\n\\nIt came from Amabel, who had just finished gathering her bouquet in the\\ngarden outside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\nDETECTIVE KNAPP ARRIVES\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, in a small room at the court-house, a still more serious\\nconversation was in progress. Dr. Talbot, Mr. Fenton, and a certain able\\nlawyer in town by the name of Harvey, were in close discussion. The last\\nhad broken the silence of years, and was telling what he knew of Mrs.\\nWebb\\'s affairs.\\n\\nHe was a shrewd man, of unblemished reputation. When called upon to\\ntalk, he talked well, but he much preferred listening, and was, as now\\nappeared, the safest repository of secrets to be found in all that\\nregion. He had been married three times, and could still count thirteen\\nchildren around his board, one reason, perhaps, why he had learned to\\ncultivate silence to such a degree. Happily, the time had come for him\\nto talk, and he talked. This is what he said:\\n\\n\"Some fifteen years ago Philemon Webb came to me with a small sum of\\nmoney, which he said he wished to have me invest for his wife. It was\\nthe fruit of a small speculation of his and he wanted it given\\nunconditionally to her without her knowledge or that of the neighbours.\\nI accordingly made out a deed of gift, which he signed with joyful\\nalacrity, and then after due thought and careful investigation, I put\\nthe money into a new enterprise then being started in Boston. It was the\\nbest stroke of business I ever did in my life. At the end of a year it\\npaid double, and after five had rolled away the accumulated interest had\\nreached such a sum that both Philemon and myself thought it wisest to\\nlet her know what she was worth and what was being done with the money.\\nI was in hopes it would lead her to make some change in her mode of\\nliving, which seemed to me out of keeping with her appearance and mental\\nqualifications; while he, I imagine, looked for something more important\\nstill--a smile on the face which had somehow lost the trick of\\nmerriment, though it had never acquired that of ill nature. But we did\\nnot know Agatha; at least I did not. When she learned that she was rich,\\nshe looked at first awestruck and then heart-pierced. Forgetting me, or\\nignoring me, it makes no matter which, she threw herself into Philemon\\'s\\narms and wept, while he, poor faithful fellow, looked as distressed as\\nif he had brought news of failure instead of triumphant success. I\\nsuppose she thought of her buried children, and what the money would\\nhave been to her if they had lived; but she did not speak of them, nor\\nam I quite sure they were in her thoughts when, after the first\\nexcitement was over, she drew back and said quietly, but in a tone of\\nstrong feeling, to Philemon: \\'You meant me a happy surprise, and you\\nmust not be disappointed. This is heart money; we will use it to make\\nour townsfolk happy.\\' I saw him glance at her dress, which was a purple\\ncalico. I remember it because of that look and because of the sad smile\\nwith which she followed his glance. \\'Can we not afford now,\\' he\\nventured, \\'a little show of luxury, or at least a ribbon or so for this\\nbeautiful throat of yours?\\' She did not answer him; but her look had a\\nrare compassion in it, a compassion, strange to say, that seemed to be\\nexpended upon him rather than upon herself. Philemon swallowed his\\ndisappointment. \\'Agatha is right,\\' he said to me. \\'We do not need\\nluxury. I do not know how I so far forgot myself as to mention it.\\' That\\nwas ten years ago, and every day since then her property has increased.\\nI did not know then, and I do not know now, why they were both so\\nanxious that all knowledge of their good fortune should be kept from\\nthose about them; but that it was to be so kept was made very evident to\\nme; and, notwithstanding all temptations to the contrary, I have\\nrefrained from uttering a word likely to give away their secret. The\\nmoney, which to all appearance was the cause of her tragic and untimely\\ndeath, was interest money which I was delegated to deliver her. I took\\nit to her day before yesterday, and it was all in crisp new notes, some\\nof them twenties, but most of them tens and fives. I am free to say\\nthere was not such another roll of fresh money in town.\"\\n\\n\"Warn all shopkeepers to keep a sharp lookout for new bills in the money\\nthey receive,\" was Dr. Talbot\\'s comment to the constable. \"Fresh ten-and\\ntwenty-dollar bills are none too common in this town. And now about her\\nwill. Did you draw that up, Harvey?\"\\n\\n\"No. I did not know she had made one. I often spoke to her about the\\nadvisability of her doing so, but she always put me off. And now it\\nseems that she had it drawn up in Boston. Could not trust her old friend\\nwith too many secrets, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"So you don\\'t know how her money has been left?\"\\n\\n\"No more than you do.\"\\n\\nHere an interruption occurred. The door opened and a slim young man,\\nwearing spectacles, came in. At sight of him they all rose.\\n\\n\"Well?\" eagerly inquired Dr. Talbot.\\n\\n\"Nothing new,\" answered the young man, with a consequential air. \"The\\nelder woman died from loss of blood consequent upon a blow given by a\\nsmall, three-sided, slender blade; the younger from a stroke of\\napoplexy, induced by fright.\"\\n\\n\"Good! I am glad to hear my instincts were not at fault. Loss of blood,\\neh? Death, then, was not instantaneous?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Strange!\" fell from the lips of his two listeners. \"She lived, yet gave\\nno alarm.\"\\n\\n\"None that was heard,\" suggested the young doctor, who was from another\\ntown.\\n\\n\"Or, if heard, reached no ears but Philemon\\'s,\" observed the constable.\\n\"Something must have taken him up-stairs.\"\\n\\n\"I am not so sure,\" said the coroner, \"that Philemon is not answerable\\nfor the whole crime, notwithstanding our failure to find the missing\\nmoney anywhere in the house. How else account for the resignation with\\nwhich she evidently met her death? Had a stranger struck her, Agatha\\nWebb would have struggled. There is no sign of struggle in the room.\"\\n\\n\"She would have struggled against Philemon had she had strength to\\nstruggle. I think she was asleep when she was struck.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! And was not standing by the table? How about the blood there,\\nthen?\"\\n\\n\"Shaken from the murderer\\'s fingers in fright or disgust.\"\\n\\n\"There was no blood on Philemon\\'s fingers.\"\\n\\n\"No; he wiped them on his sleeve.\"\\n\\n\"If he was the one to use the dagger against her, where is the dagger?\\nShould we not be able to find it somewhere about the premises?\"\\n\\n\"He may have buried it outside. Crazy men are supernaturally cunning.\"\\n\\n\"When you can produce it from any place inside that board fence, I will\\nconsider your theory. At present I limit my suspicions of Philemon to\\nthe half-unconscious attentions which a man of disordered intellect\\nmight give a wife bleeding and dying under his eyes. My idea on the\\nsubject is---\"\\n\\n\"Would you be so kind as not to give utterance to your ideas until I\\nhave been able to form some for myself?\" interrupted a voice from the\\ndoorway.\\n\\nAs this voice was unexpected, they all turned. A small man with sleek\\ndark hair and expressionless features stood before them. Behind him was\\nAbel, carrying a hand-bag and umbrella.\\n\\n\"The detective from Boston,\" announced the latter. Coroner Talbot rose.\\n\\n\"You are in good time,\" he remarked. \"We have work of no ordinary nature\\nfor you.\"\\n\\nThe man failed to look interested. But then his countenance was not one\\nto show emotion.\\n\\n\"My name is Knapp,\" said he. \"I have had my supper, and am ready to go\\nto work. I have read the newspapers; all I want now is any additional\\nfacts that have come to light since the telegraphic dispatches were sent\\nto Boston. Facts, mind you; not theories. I never allow myself to be\\nhampered by other persons\\' theories.\"\\n\\nNot liking his manner, which was brusque and too self-important for a\\nman of such insignificant appearance, Coroner Talbot referred him to Mr.\\nFenton, who immediately proceeded to give him the result of such\\ninvestigations as he and his men had been able to make; which done, Mr.\\nKnapp put on his hat and turned toward the door.\\n\\n\"I will go to the house and see for myself what is to be learned there,\"\\nsaid he. \"May I ask the privilege of going alone?\" he added, as Mr.\\nFenton moved. \"Abel will see that I am given admittance.\"\\n\\n\"Show me your credentials,\" said the coroner. He did so. \"They seem all\\nright, and you should be a man who understands his business. Go alone,\\nif you prefer, but bring your conclusions here. They may need some\\ncorrecting.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I will return,\" Knapp nonchalantly remarked, and went out, having\\nmade anything but a favourable impression upon the assembled gentlemen.\\n\\n\"I wish we had shown more grit and tried to handle this thing\\nourselves,\" observed Mr. Fenton. \"I cannot bear to think of that cold,\\nbloodless creature hovering over our beloved Agatha.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder at Carson. Why should he send us such a man? Could he not see\\nthe matter demanded extraordinary skill and judgment?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, this fellow may have skill. But he is so unpleasant. I hate to deal\\nwith folks of such fish-like characteristics. But who is this?\" he asked\\nas a gentle tap was heard at the door. \"Why, it\\'s Loton. What can he\\nwant here?\"\\n\\nThe man whose presence in the doorway had called out this exclamation\\nstarted at the sound of the doctor\\'s heavy voice, and came very\\nhesitatingly forward. He was of a weak, irritable type, and seemed to be\\nin a state of great excitement.\\n\\n\"I beg pardon,\" said he, \"for showing myself. I don\\'t like to intrude\\ninto such company, but I have something to tell you which may be of use,\\nsirs, though it isn\\'t any great thing, either.\"\\n\\n\"Something about the murder which has taken place?\" asked the coroner,\\nin a milder tone. He knew Loton well, and realised the advisability of\\nencouragement in his case.\\n\\n\"The murder! Oh, I wouldn\\'t presume to say anything about the murder.\\nI\\'m not the man to stir up any such subject as that. It\\'s about the\\nmoney--or some money--more money than usually falls into my till. It--it\\nwas rather queer, sirs, and I have felt the flutter of it all day. Shall\\nI tell you about it? It happened last night, late last night, sirs, so\\nlate that I was in bed with my wife, and had been snoring, she said,\\nfour hours.\"\\n\\n\"What money? New money? Crisp, fresh bills, Loton?\" eagerly questioned\\nMr. Fenton.\\n\\nLoton, who was the keeper of a small confectionery and bakery store on\\none of the side streets leading up the hill, shifted uneasily between\\nhis two interrogators, and finally addressed himself to the coroner:\\n\\n\"It was new money. I thought it felt so at night, but I was sure of it\\nin the morning. A brand-new bill, sir, a--But that isn\\'t the queerest\\nthing about it. I was asleep, sir, sound asleep, and dreaming of my\\ncourting days (for I asked Sally at the circus, sirs, and the band\\nplaying on the hill made me think of it), when I was suddenly shook\\nawake by Sally herself, who says she hadn\\'t slept a wink for listening\\nto the music and wishing she was a girl again. \\'There\\'s a man at the\\nshop door,\\' cries she. \\'He\\'s a-calling of you; go and see what he\\nwants.\\' I was mad at being wakened. Dreaming is pleasant, specially when\\nclowns and kissing get mixed up in it, but duty is duty, and so into the\\nshop I stumbled, swearing a bit perhaps, for I hadn\\'t stopped for a\\nlight and it was as dark as double shutters could make it. The hammering\\nhad become deafening. No let up till I reached the door, when it\\nsuddenly ceased.\\n\\n\"\\'What is it?\\' I cried. \\'Who\\'s there and what do you want?\\'\\n\\n\"A trembling voice answered me. \\'Let me in,\\' it said. \\'I want to buy\\nsomething to eat. For God\\'s sake, open the door!\\'\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know why I obeyed, for it was late, and I did not know the\\nvoice, but something in the impatient rattling of the door which\\naccompanied the words affected me in spite of myself, and I slowly\\nopened my shop to this midnight customer.\\n\\n\"\\'You must be hungry,\\' I began. But the person who had crowded in as\\nsoon as the opening was large enough wouldn\\'t let me finish.\\n\\n\"\\'Bread! I want bread, or crackers, or anything that you can find\\neasiest,\\' he gasped, like a man who had been running. \\'Here\\'s money\\';\\nand he poked into my hand a bill so stiff that it rattled. \\'It\\'s more\\nthan enough,\\' he hastened to say, as I hesitated over it, \\'but never\\nmind that; I\\'ll come for the change in the morning.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Who are you? I cried. \\'You are not Blind Willy, I\\'m sure.\\'\\n\\n\"But his only answer was \\'Bread!\\' while he leaned so hard against the\\ncounter I felt it shake.\\n\\n\"I could not stand that cry of \\'Bread!\\' so I groped about in the dark,\\nand found him a stale loaf, which I put into his arms, with a short,\\n\\'There! Now tell me what your name is.\\'\\n\\n\"But at this he seemed to shrink into himself; and muttering something\\nthat might pass for thanks, he stumbled towards the door and rushed\\nhastily out. Running after him, I listened eagerly to his steps. They\\nwent up the hill.\"\\n\\n\"And the money? What about the money?\" asked the coroner. \"Didn\\'t he\\ncome back for the change?\"\\n\\n\"No. I put it in the till, thinking it was a dollar bill. But when I\\ncame to look at it in the morning, it was a twenty; yes, sirs, a\\ntwenty!\"\\n\\nThis was startling. The coroner and the constable looked at each other\\nbefore looking again at him.\\n\\n\"And where is that bill now?\" asked the former. \"Have you brought it\\nwith you?\"\\n\\n\"I have, sir. It\\'s been in and out of the till twenty times to-day. I\\nhaven\\'t known what to do with it. I don\\'t like to think wrong of\\nanybody, but when I heard that Mrs. Webb (God bless her!) was murdered\\nlast night for money, I couldn\\'t rest for the weight of this thing on my\\nconscience. Here\\'s the bill, sir. I wish I had let the old man rap on my\\ndoor till morning before I had taken it from him.\"\\n\\nThey did not share this feeling. A distinct and valuable clew seemed to\\nbe afforded them by the fresh, crisp bill they saw in his hand. Silently\\nDr. Talbot took it, while Mr. Fenton, with a shrewd look, asked:\\n\\n\"What reasons have you for calling this mysterious customer old? I\\nthought it was so dark you could not see him.\"\\n\\nThe man, who looked relieved since he had rid himself of the bill, eyed\\nthe constable in some perplexity.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t see a feature of his face,\" said he, \"and yet I\\'m sure he was\\nold. I never thought of him as being anything else.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we will see. And is that all you have to tell us?\"\\n\\nHis nod was expressive, and they let him go.\\n\\nAn hour or so later Detective Knapp made his reappearance.\\n\\n\"Well,\" asked the coroner, as he came quietly in and closed the door\\nbehind him, \"what\\'s your opinion?\"\\n\\n\"Simple case, sir. Murdered for money. Find the man with a flowing\\nbeard.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\nTHE MAN WITH A BEARD\\n\\n\\nThere were but few men in town who wore long beards. A list was made of\\nthese and handed to the coroner, who regarded it with a grim smile.\\n\\n\"Not a man whose name is here would be guilty of a misdemeanour, let\\nalone a crime. You must look outside of our village population for the\\nmurderer of Agatha Webb.\"\\n\\n\"Very likely, but tell me something first about these persons,\" urged\\nKnapp. \"Who is Edward Hope?\"\\n\\n\"A watch repairer; a man of estimable character.\"\\n\\n\"And Sylvester Chubb?\"\\n\\n\"A farmer who, to support his mother, wife, and seven children, works\\nfrom morning till sundown on his farm, and from sundown till 11 o\\'clock\\nat night on little fancy articles he cuts out from wood and sells in\\nBoston.\"\\n\\n\"John Barker, Thomas Elder, Timothy Sinn?\"\\n\\n\"All good men; I can vouch for every one of them.\"\\n\\n\"And John Zabel, James Zabel?\"\\n\\n\"Irreproachable, both of them. Famous ship--builders once, but the change\\nto iron ship-building has thrown them out of business. Pity, too, for\\nthey were remarkable builders. By the by, Fenton, we don\\'t see them at\\nchurch or on the docks any more.\"\\n\\n\"No, they keep very much to themselves; getting old, like ourselves,\\nTalbot.\"\\n\\n\"Lively boys once. We must hunt them up, Fenton. Can\\'t bear to see old\\nfriends drop away from good company. But this isn\\'t business. You need\\nnot pause over their names, Knapp.\"\\n\\nBut Knapp had slipped out.\\n\\nWe will follow him.\\n\\nWalking briskly down the street, he went up the steps of a certain house\\nand rang the bell. A gentleman with a face not entirely unknown to us\\ncame to the door.\\n\\nThe detective did not pause for preliminaries.\\n\\n\"Are you Mr. Crane?\" he asked,--\"the gentleman who ran against a man\\ncoming out of Mrs. Webb\\'s house last night?\"\\n\\n\"I am Mr. Crane,\" was the slightly surprised rejoinder, \"and I was run\\nagainst by a man there, yes.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" remarked the detective, quietly, \"my name is Knapp. I have\\nbeen sent from Boston to look into this matter, and I have an idea that\\nyou can help me more than any other man here in Sutherlandtown. Who was\\nthis person who came in contact with you so violently? You know, even if\\nyou have been careful not to mention any names.\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken. I don\\'t know; I can\\'t know. He wore a sweeping beard,\\nand walked and acted like a man no longer young, but beyond that---\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Crane, excuse me, but I know men. If you had no suspicion as to\\nwhom that person was you would not look so embarrassed. You suspect, or,\\nat least, associate in your own mind a name with the man you met. Was it\\neither of these you see written here?\"\\n\\nMr. Crane glanced at the card on which the other had scribbled a couple\\nof names, and started perceptibly.\\n\\n\"You have me,\" said he; \"you must be a man of remarkable perspicacity.\"\\n\\nThe detective smiled and pocketed his card. The names he thus concealed\\nwere John Zabel, James Zabel.\\n\\n\"You have not said which of the two it was,\" Knapp quietly suggested.\\n\\n\"No,\" returned the minister, \"and I have not even thought. Indeed, I am\\nnot sure that I have not made a dreadful mistake in thinking it was\\neither. A glimpse such as I had is far from satisfactory; and they are\\nboth such excellent men---\"\\n\\n\"Eight! You did make a mistake, of course, I have not the least doubt of\\nit. So don\\'t think of the matter again. I will find out who the real man\\nwas; rest easy.\"\\n\\nAnd with the lightest of bows, Knapp drew off and passed as quickly as\\nhe could, without attracting attention, round the corner to the\\nconfectioner\\'s.\\n\\nHere his attack was warier. Sally Loton was behind the counter with her\\nhusband, and they had evidently been talking the matter over very\\nconfidentially. But Knapp was not to be awed by her small, keen eye or\\nstrident voice, and presently succeeded in surprising a knowing look on\\nthe lady\\'s face, which convinced him that in the confidences between\\nhusband and wife a name had been used which she appeared to be less\\nunwilling to impart than he. Knapp, consequently, turned his full\\nattention towards her, using in his attack that oldest and subtlest\\nweapon against the sex--flattery.\\n\\n\"My dear madam,\" said he, \"your good heart is apparent; your husband has\\nconfided to you a name which you, out of fear of some mistake, hesitate\\nto repeat. A neighbourly spirit, ma\\'am, a very neighbourly spirit; but\\nyou should not allow your goodness to defeat the ends of justice. If you\\nsimply told us whom this man resembled we would be able to get some idea\\nof his appearance.\"\\n\\n\"He didn\\'t resemble anyone I know,\" growled Loton. \"It was too dark for\\nme to see how he looked.\"\\n\\n\"His voice, then? People are traced by their voices.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t recognise his voice.\"\\n\\nKnapp smiled, his eye still on the woman.\\n\\n\"Yet you have thought of someone he reminded you of?\"\\n\\nThe man was silent, but the wife tossed her head ever so lightly.\\n\\n\"Now, you must have had your reasons for that. No one thinks of a good\\nand respectable neighbour in connection with the buying of a loaf of\\nbread at midnight with a twenty-dollar bill, without some positive\\nreason.\"\\n\\n\"The man wore a beard. I felt it brush my hand as he took the loaf.\"\\n\\n\"Good! That is a point.\"\\n\\n\"Which made me think of other men who wore beards.\"\\n\\n\"As, for instance---\"\\n\\nThe detective had taken from his pocket the card which he had used with\\nsuch effect at the minister\\'s, and as he said these words twirled it so\\nthat the two names written upon it fell under Sally Loton\\'s inquisitive\\neyes. The look with which she read them was enough. John Zabel, James\\nZabel.\\n\\n\"Who told you it was either of these men?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"You did,\" he retorted, pocketing the card with a smile.\\n\\n\"La, now! Samuel, I never spoke a word,\" she insisted, in anxious\\nprotest to her husband, as the detective slid quietly from the store.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII\\n\\nWATTLES COMES\\n\\n\\nThe Hallidays lived but a few rods from the Sutherlands. Yet as it was\\ndusk when Miss Halliday rose to depart, Frederick naturally offered his\\nservices as her escort.\\n\\nShe accepted them with a slight blush, the first he had ever seen on her\\nface, or at least had ever noted there. It caused him such surprise that\\nhe forgot Amabel\\'s presence in the garden till they came upon her at the\\ngate.\\n\\n\"A pleasant evening,\" observed that young girl in her high, unmusical\\nvoice.\\n\\n\"Very,\" was Miss Halliday\\'s short reply; and for a moment the two faces\\nwere in line as he held open the gate before his departing guest.\\n\\nThey were very different faces in feature and expression, and till that\\nnight he had never thought of comparing them. Indeed, the fascination\\nwhich beamed from Amabel Page\\'s far from regular features had put all\\nothers out of his mind, but now, as he surveyed the two girls, the\\ncandour and purity which marked Agnes\\'s countenance came out so strongly\\nunder his glance that Amabel lost all attraction for him, and he drew\\nhis young neighbour hastily away.\\n\\nAmabel noted the movement and smiled. Her contempt for Agnes Halliday\\'s\\ncharms amounted to disdain.\\n\\nShe might have felt less confidence in her own had she been in a\\nposition to note the frequent glances Frederick cast at his old playmate\\nas they proceeded slowly up the road. Not that there was any passion in\\nthem--he was too full of care for that; but the curiosity which could\\nprompt him to turn his head a dozen times in the course of so short a\\nwalk, to see why Agnes Halliday held her face so persistently away from\\nhim, had an element of feeling in it that was more or less significant.\\nAs for Agnes, she was so unlike her accustomed self as to astonish even\\nherself. Whereas she had never before walked a dozen steps with him\\nwithout indulging in some sharp saying, she found herself disinclined to\\nspeak at all, much less to speak lightly. In mutual silence, then, they\\nreached the gateway leading into the Halliday grounds. But Agnes having\\npassed in, they both stopped and for the first time looked squarely at\\neach other. Her eyes fell first, perhaps because his had changed in his\\ncontemplation of her. He smiled as he saw this, and in a half-careless,\\nhalf-wistful tone, said quietly:\\n\\n\"Agnes, what would you think of a man who, after having committed little\\nelse but folly all his life, suddenly made up his mind to turn\\nabsolutely toward the right and to pursue it in face of every obstacle\\nand every discouragement?\"\\n\\n\"I should think,\" she slowly replied, with one quick lift of her eyes\\ntoward his face, \"that he had entered upon the noblest effort of which\\nman is capable, and the hardest. I should have great sympathy for that\\nman, Frederick.\"\\n\\n\"Would you?\" he said, recalling Amabel\\'s face with bitter aversion as he\\ngazed into the womanly countenance he had hitherto slighted as\\nuninteresting. \"It is the first kind word you have ever given me, Agnes.\\nPossibly it is the first I have ever deserved.\"\\n\\nAnd without another word he doffed his hat, saluted her, and vanished\\ndown the hillside.\\n\\nShe remained; remained so long that it was nearly nine when she entered\\nthe family parlour. As she came in her mother looked up and was startled\\nat her unaccustomed pallor.\\n\\n\"Why, Agnes,\" cried her mother, \"what is the matter?\"\\n\\nHer answer was inaudible. What was the matter? She dreaded, even feared,\\nto ask herself.\\n\\nMeantime a strange scene was taking place in the woods toward which she\\nhad seen Frederick go. The moon, which was particularly bright that\\nnight, shone upon a certain hollow where a huge tree lay. Around it the\\nunderbrush was thick and the shadow dark, but in this especial place the\\nopening was large enough for the rays to enter freely. Into this circlet\\nof light Frederick Sutherland had come. Alone and without the restraint\\nimposed upon him by watching eyes, he showed a countenance so wan and\\nfull of trouble that it was well it could not be seen by either of the\\ntwo women whose thoughts were at that moment fixed upon him. To Amabel\\nit would have given a throb of selfish hope, while to Agnes it would\\nhave brought a pang of despair which might have somewhat too suddenly\\ninterpreted to her the mystery of her own sensations.\\n\\nHe had bent at once to the hollow space made by the outspreading roots\\njust mentioned, and was feeling with an air of confidence along the\\nground for something he had every reason to expect to find, when the\\nshock of a sudden distrust seized him, and he flung himself down in\\nterror, feeling and feeling again among the fallen leaves and broken\\ntwigs, till a full realisation of his misfortune reached him, and he was\\nobliged to acknowledge that the place was empty.\\n\\nOverwhelmed at his loss, aghast at the consequences it must entail upon\\nhim, he rose in a trembling sweat, crying out in his anger and dismay:\\n\\n\"She has been here! She has taken it!\" And realising for the first time\\nthe subtlety and strength of the antagonist pitted against him, he\\nforgot his new resolutions and even that old promise made in his\\nchildhood to Agatha Webb, and uttered oath after oath, cursing himself,\\nthe woman, and what she had done, till a casual glance at the heavens\\noverhead, in which the liquid moon hung calm and beautiful, recalled him\\nto himself. With a sense of shame, the keener that it was a new\\nsensation in his breast, he ceased his vain repinings, and turning from\\nthe unhallowed spot, made his way with deeper and deeper misgivings\\ntoward a home made hateful to him now by the presence of the woman who\\nwas thus bent upon his ruin.\\n\\nHe understood her now. He rated at its full value both her determination\\nand her power, and had she been so unfortunate as to have carried her\\nimprudence to the point of surprising him by her presence, it would have\\ntaken more than the memory of that day\\'s solemn resolves to have kept\\nhim from using his strength against her. But she was wise, and did not\\nintrude upon him in his hour of anger, though who could say she was not\\nnear enough to hear the sigh which broke irresistibly from his lips as\\nhe emerged from the wood and approached his father\\'s house?\\n\\nA lamp was still burning in Mr. Sutherland\\'s study over the front door,\\nand the sight of it seemed to change for a moment the current of\\nFrederick\\'s thoughts. Pausing at the gate, he considered with himself,\\nand then with a freer countenance and a lighter step was about to\\nproceed inward, when he heard the sound of a heavy breather coming up\\nthe hill, and hesitated--why he hardly knew, except that every advancing\\nstep occasioned him more or less apprehension.\\n\\nThe person, whoever it was, stopped before reaching the brow of the\\nhill, and, panting heavily, muttered an oath which Frederick heard.\\nThough it was no more profane than those which had just escaped his own\\nlips in the forest, it produced an effect upon him which was only second\\nin intensity to the terror of the discovery that the money he had so\\nsafely hidden was gone.\\n\\nTrembling in every limb, he dashed down the hill and confronted the\\nperson standing there.\\n\\n\"You!\" he cried, \"you!\" And for a moment he looked as if he would like\\nto fell to the ground the man before him.\\n\\nBut this man was a heavyweight of no ordinary physical strength and\\nadroitness, and only smiled at Frederick\\'s heat and threatening\\nattitude.\\n\\n\"I thought I would be made welcome,\" he smiled, with just the hint of\\nsinister meaning in his tone. Then, before Frederick could speak: \"I\\nhave merely saved you a trip to Boston; why so much anger, friend? You\\nhave the money; of that I am positive.\"\\n\\n\"Hush! We can\\'t talk here,\" whispered Frederick. \"Come into the grounds,\\nor, what would be better, into the woods over there.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t go into any woods with you,\" laughed the other; \"not after last\\nnight, my friend. But I will talk low; that\\'s no more than fair; I don\\'t\\nwant to put you into any other man\\'s power, especially if you have the\\nmoney.\"\\n\\n\"Wattles,\"--Frederick\\'s tone was broken, almost unintelligible,--\"what\\ndo you mean by your allusion to last night? Have you dared to connect\\nme---\"\\n\\n\"Pooh! Pooh!\" interrupted the other, good-humouredly. \"Don\\'t let us\\nwaste words over a chance expression I may have dropped. I don\\'t care\\nanything about last night\\'s work, or who was concerned in it. That\\'s\\nnothing to me. All I want, my boy, is the money, and that I want\\ndevilish bad, or I would not have run up here from Boston, when I might\\nhave made half a hundred off a countryman Lewis brought in from the\\nCanada wilds this morning.\"\\n\\n\"Wattles, I swear---\"\\n\\nBut the hand he had raised was quickly drawn down by the other.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t,\" said the older man, shortly. \"It won\\'t pay, Sutherland.\\nStage-talk never passed for anything with me. Besides, your white face\\ntells a truer story than your lips, and time is precious. I want to take\\nthe 11 o\\'clock train back. So down with the cash. Nine hundred and\\nfifty-five it is, but, being friends, we will let the odd five go.\"\\n\\n\"Wattles, I was to bring it to you to-morrow, or was it the next day? I\\ndo not want to give it to you to-night; indeed, I cannot, but--Wattles,\\nwait, stop! Where are you going?\"\\n\\n\"To see your father. I want to tell him that his son owes me a debt;\\nthat this debt was incurred in a way that lays him liable to arrest for\\nforgery; that, bad as he thinks you, there are facts which can be picked\\nup in Boston which would render Frederick Sutherland\\'s continued\\nresidence under the parental roof impossible; that, in fact, you are a\\nscamp of the first water, and that only my friendship for you has kept\\nyou out of prison so long. Won\\'t that make a nice story for the old\\ngentleman\\'s ears!\"\\n\\n\"Wattles--I--oh, my God! Wattles, stop a minute and listen to me. I have\\nnot got the money. I had enough this morning to pay you, had it\\nlegitimately, Wattles, but it has been stolen from me and---\"\\n\\n\"I will also tell him,\" the other broke in, as quietly as if Frederick\\nhad not uttered a word, \"that in a certain visit to Boston you lost five\\nhundred dollars on one hand; that you lost it unfairly, not having a\\ndollar to pay with; that to prevent scandal I became your security,\\nwith the understanding that I was to be paid at the end of ten days from\\nthat night; that you thereupon played again and lost four hundred and\\nodd more, so that your debt amounted to nine hundred and fifty-five\\ndollars; that the ten days passed without payment; that, wanting money,\\nI pressed you and even resorted to a threat or two; and that, seeing me\\nin earnest, you swore that the dollars should be mine within five days;\\nthat instead of remaining in Boston to get them, you came here; and that\\nthis morning at a very early hour you telegraphed that the funds were to\\nhand and that you would bring them down to me to-morrow. The old\\ngentleman may draw conclusions from this, Sutherland, which may make his\\nposition as your father anything but grateful to him. He may even--Ah,\\nyou would try that game, would you?\"\\n\\nThe young man had flung himself at the older man\\'s throat as if he would\\nchoke off the words he saw trembling on his lips. But the struggle thus\\nbegun was short. In a moment both stood panting, and Frederick, with\\nlowered head, was saying humbly:\\n\\n\"I beg pardon, Wattles, but you drive me mad with your suggestions and\\nconclusions. I have not got the money, but I will try and get it. Wait\\nhere.\"\\n\\n\"For ten minutes, Sutherland; no longer! The moon is bright, and I can\\nsee the hands of my watch distinctly. At a quarter to ten, you will\\nreturn here with the amount I have mentioned, or I will seek it at your\\nfather\\'s hands in his own study.\"\\n\\nFrederick made a hurried gesture and vanished up the walk. Next moment\\nhe was at his father\\'s study door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII\\n\\nWATTLES GOES\\n\\n\\nMr. Sutherland was busily engaged with a law paper when his son entered\\nhis presence, but at sight of that son\\'s face, he dropped the paper with\\nan alacrity which Frederick was too much engaged with his own thoughts\\nto notice.\\n\\n\"Father,\" he began without preamble or excuse, \"I am in serious and\\nimmediate need of nine hundred and fifty dollars. I want it so much that\\nI ask you to make me a check for that amount to-night, conscious though\\nI am that you have every right to deny me this request, and that my debt\\nto you already passes the bound of presumption on my part and indulgence\\non yours. I cannot tell you why I want it or for what. That belongs to\\nmy past life, the consequences of which I have not yet escaped, but I\\nfeel bound to state that you will not be the loser by this material\\nproof of confidence in me, as I shall soon be in a position to repay all\\nmy debts, among which this will necessarily stand foremost.\"\\n\\nThe old gentleman looked startled and nervously fingered the paper he\\nhad let fall. \"Why do you say you will soon be in a position to repay\\nme? What do you mean by that?\"\\n\\nThe flash, which had not yet subsided from the young man\\'s face, ebbed\\nslowly away as he encountered his father\\'s eye.\\n\\n\"I mean to work,\" he murmured. \"I mean to make a man of myself as soon\\nas possible.\"\\n\\nThe look which Mr. Sutherland gave him was more inquiring than\\nsympathetic.\\n\\n\"And you need this money for a start?\" said he.\\n\\nFrederick bowed; he seemed to be losing the faculty of speech. The clock\\nover the mantel had told off five of the precious moments.\\n\\n\"I will give it to you,\" said his father, and drew out his check-book.\\nBut he did not hasten to open it; his eyes still rested on his son.\\n\\n\"Now,\" murmured the young man. \"There is a train leaving soon. I wish to\\nget it away on that train.\"\\n\\nHis father frowned with natural distrust.\\n\\n\"I wish you would confide in me,\" said he.\\n\\nFrederick did not answer. The hands of the clock were moving on.\\n\\n\"I will give it to you; but I should like to know what for.\"\\n\\n\"It is impossible for me to tell you,\" groaned the young man, starting\\nas he heard a step on the walk without.\\n\\n\"Your need has become strangely imperative,\" proceeded the other. \"Has\\nMiss Page---\"\\n\\nFrederick took a step forward and laid his hand on his father\\'s arm.\\n\\n\"It is not for her,\" he whispered. \"It goes into other hands.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland, who had turned over the document as his son approached,\\nbreathed more easily. Taking up his pen, he dipped it in the ink.\\nFrederick watched him with constantly whitening cheek. The step on the\\nwalk had mounted to the front door.\\n\\n\"Nine hundred and fifty?\" inquired the father.\\n\\n\"Nine hundred and fifty,\" answered the son.\\n\\nThe judge, with a last look, stooped over the book. The hands of the\\nclock pointed to a quarter to ten.\\n\\n\"Father, I have my whole future in which to thank you,\" cried Frederick,\\nseizing the check his father held out to him and making rapidly for the\\ndoor. \"I will be back before midnight.\" And he flung himself down-stairs\\njust as the front door opened and Wattles stepped in.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" exclaimed the latter, as his eye fell on the paper fluttering in\\nthe other\\'s hand, \"I expected money, not paper.\"\\n\\n\"The paper is good,\" answered Frederick, drawing him swiftly out of the\\nhouse. \"It has my father\\'s signature upon it.\"\\n\\n\"Your father\\'s signature?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nWattles gave it a look, then slowly shook his head at Frederick.\\n\\n\"Is it as well done as the one you tried to pass off on Brady?\"\\n\\nFrederick cringed, and for a moment looked as if the struggle was too\\nmuch for him. Then he rallied and eying Wattles firmly, said:\\n\\n\"You have a right to distrust me, but you are on the wrong track,\\nWattles. What I did once, I can never do again; and I hope I may live to\\nprove myself a changed man. As for that check, I will soon prove its\\nvalue in your eyes. Follow me up-stairs to my father.\"\\n\\nHis energy--the energy of despair, no doubt seemed to make an impression\\non the other.\\n\\n\"You might as well proclaim yourself a forger outright, as to force your\\nfather to declare this to be his signature,\" he observed.\\n\\n\"I know it,\" said Frederick.\\n\\n\"Yet you will run that risk?\"\\n\\n\"If you oblige me.\"\\n\\nWattles shrugged his shoulders. He was a magnificent-looking man and\\ntowered in that old colonial hall like a youthful giant.\\n\\n\"I bear you no ill will,\" said he. \"If this represents money, I am\\nsatisfied, and I begin to think it does. But listen, Sutherland.\\nSomething has happened to you. A week ago you would have put a bullet\\nthrough my head before you would have been willing to have so\\ncompromised yourself. I think I know what that something is. To save\\nyourself from being thought guilty of a big crime you are willing to\\nincur suspicion of a small one. It\\'s a wise move, my boy, but look out!\\nNo tricks with me or my friendship may not hold. Meantime, I cash this\\ncheck to-morrow.\" And he swung away through the night with a grand-opera\\nselection on his lips.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV\\n\\nA FINAL TEMPTATION\\n\\n\\nFrederick looked like a man thoroughly exhausted when the final echo of\\nthis hateful voice died away on the hillside. For the last twenty hours\\nhe had been the prey of one harrowing emotion after another, and human\\nnature could endure no more without rest.\\n\\nBut rest would not come. The position in which he found himself, between\\nAmabel and the man who had just left, was of too threatening a nature\\nfor him to ignore. But one means of escape presented itself. It was a\\ncowardly one; but anything was better than to make an attempt to stand\\nhis ground against two such merciless antagonists; so he resolved upon\\nflight.\\n\\nPacking up a few necessaries and leaving a letter behind him for his\\nfather, he made his way down the stairs of the now darkened house to a\\ndoor opening upon the garden. To his astonishment he found it unlocked,\\nbut, giving little heed to this in his excitement, he opened it with\\ncaution, and, with a parting sigh for the sheltering home he was about\\nto leave forever, stepped from the house he no longer felt worthy to\\ninhabit.\\n\\nHis intention was to take the train at Portchester, and that he might\\nreach that place without inconvenient encounters, he decided to proceed\\nby a short cut through the fields. This led him north along the ridge\\nthat overlooks the road running around the base of the hill. He did not\\nthink of this road, however, or of anything, in fact, but the necessity\\nof taking the very earliest train out of Portchester. As this left at\\n3.30 A.M., he realised that he must hasten in order to reach it. But he\\nwas not destined to take it or any other train out of Portchester that\\nnight, for when he reached the fence dividing Mr. Sutherland\\'s grounds\\nfrom those of his adjoining neighbour, he saw, drawn up in the moonlight\\njust at the point where he had intended to leap the fence, the form of a\\nwoman with one hand held out to stop him.\\n\\nIt was Amabel.\\n\\nConfounded by this check and filled with an anger that was nigh to\\ndangerous, he fell back and then immediately sprang forward.\\n\\n\"What are you doing here?\" he cried. \"Don\\'t you know that it is eleven\\no\\'clock and that my father requires the house to be closed at that\\nhour?\"\\n\\n\"And you?\" was her sole retort; \"what are you doing here? Are you\\nsearching for flowers in the woods, and is that valise you carry the\\nreceptacle in which you hope to put your botanical specimens?\"\\n\\nWith a savage gesture he dropped the valise and took her fiercely by the\\nshoulders.\\n\\n\"Where have you hidden my money?\" he hissed. \"Tell me, or---\"\\n\\n\"Or what?\" she asked, smiling into his face in a way that made him lose\\nhis grip.\\n\\n\"Or--or I cannot answer for myself,\" he proceeded, stammering. \"Do you.\\nthink I can endure everything from you because you are a woman? No; I\\nwill have those bills, every one of them, or show myself your master.\\nWhere are they, you incarnate fiend?\"\\n\\nIt was an unwise word to use, but she did not seem to heed it.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" she said softly, and with a lingering accent, as if his grasp of\\nher had been a caress to which she was not entirely averse. \"I did not\\nthink you would discover its loss so soon. When did you go to the woods,\\nFrederick? And was Miss Halliday with you?\"\\n\\nHe had a disposition to strike her, but controlled himself. Blows would\\nnot avail against the softness of this suave, yet merciless, being. Only\\na will as strong as her own could hope to cope with this smiling fury;\\nand this he was determined to show, though, alas! he had everything to\\nlose in a struggle that robbed her of nothing but a hope which was but a\\nbaseless fabric at best; for he was more than ever determined never to\\nmarry her.\\n\\n\"A man does not need to wait long to miss his own,\" said he. \"And if you\\nhave taken this money, which, you do not deny, you have shown yourself\\nvery short-sighted, for danger lies closer to the person holding this\\nmoney than to the one you vilify by your threats. This you will find,\\nAmabel, when you come to make use of the weapon with which you have\\nthought to arm yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Tut, tut!\" was her contemptuous reply. \"Do you consider me a child? Do\\nI look like a babbling infant, Frederick?\"\\n\\nHer face, which had been lifted to his in saying this, was so illumined,\\nboth by her smile, which was strangely enchanting for one so evil, and\\nby the moonlight, which so etherialises all that it touches, that he\\nfound himself forced to recall that other purer, truer face he had left\\nat the honeysuckle porch to keep down a last wild impulse toward her,\\nwhich would have been his undoing, both in this world and the next, as\\nhe knew.\\n\\n\"Or do I look simply like a woman?\" she went on, seeing the impression\\nshe had made, and playing upon it. \"A woman who understands herself and\\nyou and all the secret perils of the game we are both playing? If I am a\\nchild, treat me as a child; but if I am a woman---\"\\n\\n\"Stand out of my way!\" he cried, catching up his valise and striding\\nfuriously by her. \"Woman or child, know that I will not be your\\nplaything to be damned in this world and in the next.\"\\n\\n\"Are you bound for the city of destruction?\" she laughed, not moving,\\nbut showing such confidence in her power to hold him back that he\\nstopped in spite of himself. \"If so, you are taking the direct road\\nthere and have only to hasten. But you had better remain in your\\nfather\\'s house; even if you are something of a prisoner there, like my\\nvery insignificant self. The outcome will be more satisfactory, even if\\nyou have to share your future with me.\"\\n\\n\"And what course will you take,\" he asked, pausing with his hand on the\\nfence, \"if I decide to choose destruction without you, rather than\\nperdition with you?\"\\n\\n\"What course? Why, I shall tell Dr. Talbot just enough to show you to be\\nas desirable a witness in the impending inquest as myself. The result I\\nleave to your judgment. But you will not drive me to this extremity. You\\nwill come back and--\"\\n\\n\"Woman, I will never come back. I shall have to dare your worst in a\\nweek and will begin by daring you now. I--\"\\n\\nBut he did not leap the fence, though he made a move to do so, for at\\nthat moment a party of men came hurrying by on the lower road, one of\\nwhom was heard to say:\\n\\n\"I will bet my head that we will put our hand on Agatha Webb\\'s murderer\\nto-night. The man who shoves twenty-dollar bills around so heedlessly\\nshould not wear a beard so long it leads to detection.\"\\n\\nIt was the coroner, the constable, Knapp, and Abel on their way to the\\nforest road on which lived John and James Zabel.\\n\\nFrederick and Amabel confronted each other, and after a moment\\'s silence\\nreturned as if by a common impulse towards the house.\\n\\n\"What have they got in their heads?\" queried she. \"Whatever it is, it\\nmay serve to occupy them till the week of your probation is over.\"\\n\\nHe did not answer. A new and overwhelming complication had been added to\\nthe difficulties of his situation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXV\\n\\nTHE ZABELS VISITED\\n\\n\\nLet us follow the party now winding up the hillside.\\n\\nIn a deeply wooded spot on a side road stood the little house to which\\nJohn and James Zabel had removed when their business on the docks had\\nterminated. There was no other dwelling of greater or lesser pretension\\non the road, which may account for the fact that none of the persons now\\napproaching it had been in that neighbourhood for years, though it was\\nby no means a long walk from the village in which they all led such busy\\nlives.\\n\\nThe heavy shadows cast by the woods through which the road meandered\\nwere not without their effect upon the spirits of the four men passing\\nthrough them, so that long before they reached the opening in which the\\nZabel cottage stood, silence had fallen upon the whole party. Dr. Talbot\\nespecially looked as if he little relished this late visit to his old\\nfriends, and not till they caught a glimpse of the long sloping roof and\\nheavy chimney of the Zabel cottage did he shake off the gloom incident\\nto the nature of his errand.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, coming to a sudden halt, \"let us understand each\\nother. We are about to make a call on two of our oldest and most\\nrespectable townsfolk. If in the course of that call I choose to make\\nmention of the twenty-dollar bill left with Loton, well and good, but if\\nnot, you are to take my reticence as proof of my own belief that they\\nhad nothing to do with it.\"\\n\\nTwo of the party bowed; Knapp, only, made no sign.\\n\\n\"There is no light in the window,\" observed Abel. \"What if we find them\\ngone to bed?\"\\n\\n\"We will wake them,\" said the constable. \"I cannot go back without being\\nmyself assured that no more money like that given to Loton remains in\\nthe house.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" remarked Knapp, and going up to the door before him, he\\nstruck a resounding knock sufficiently startling in that place of\\nsilence.\\n\\nBut loud as the summons was it brought no answer. Not only the\\nmoon-lighted door, but the little windows on each side of it remained\\nshut, and there was no evidence that the knock had been heard.\\n\\n\"Zabel! John Zabel!\" shouted the constable, stepping around the side of\\nthe house. \"Get up, my good friends, and let an old crony in. James!\\nJohn! Late as it is, we have business with you. Open the door; don\\'t\\nstop to dress.\"\\n\\nBut this appeal received no more recognition than the first, and after\\nrapping on the window against which he had flung the words, he came back\\nand looked up and down the front of the house.\\n\\nIt had a solitary aspect and was much less comfortable-looking than he\\nhad expected. Indeed, there were signs of poverty, or at least of\\nneglect, about the place that astonished him. Not only had the weeds\\nbeen allowed to grow over the doorstep, but from the unpainted front\\nitself bits of boards had rotted away, leaving great gaps about the\\nwindow-ledges and at the base of the sunken and well-nigh toppling\\nchimney. The moon flooding the roof showed up all these imperfections\\nwith pitiless insistence, and the torn edges of the green paper shades\\nthat half concealed the rooms within were plainly to be seen, as well as\\nthe dismantled knocker which hung by one nail to the old cracked door.\\nThe vision of Knapp with his ear laid against this door added to the\\nforlorn and sinister aspect of the scene, and gave to the constable, who\\nremembered the brothers in their palmy days when they were the life and\\npride of the town, a by no means agreeable sensation, as he advanced\\ntoward the detective and asked him what they should do now.\\n\\n\"Break down the door!\" was the uncompromising reply. \"Or, wait! The\\nwindows of country houses are seldom fastened; let me see if I cannot\\nenter by some one of them.\"\\n\\n\"Better not,\" said the coroner, with considerable feeling. \"Let us\\nexhaust all other means first.\" And he took hold of the knob of the door\\nto shake it, when to his surprise it turned and the door opened. It had\\nnot been locked.\\n\\nRather taken aback by this, he hesitated. But Knapp showed less scruple.\\nWithout waiting for any man\\'s permission, he glided in and stepped\\ncautiously, but without any delay, into a room the door of which stood\\nwide open before him. The constable was about to follow when he saw\\nKnapp come stumbling back.\\n\\n\"Devilish work,\" he muttered, and drew the others in to see.\\n\\nNever will any of these men forget the sight that there met their eyes.\\n\\nOn the floor near the entrance lay one brother, in a streak of\\nmoonlight, which showed every feature of his worn and lifeless face, and\\nat a table drawn up in the centre of the room sat the other, rigid in\\ndeath, with a book clutched in his hand.\\n\\nBoth, had been dead some time, and on the faces and in the aspects of\\nboth was visible a misery that added its own gloom to the pitiable and\\ngruesome scene, and made the shining of the great white moon, which\\nfilled every corner of the bare room, seem a mockery well-nigh\\nunendurable to those who contemplated it. John, dead in his chair!\\nJames, dead on the floor!\\n\\nKnapp, who of all present was least likely to feel the awesome nature of\\nthe tragedy, was naturally the first to speak.\\n\\n\"Both wear long beards,\" said he, \"but the one lying on the floor was\\ndoubtless Loton\\'s customer. Ah!\" he cried, pointing at the table, as he\\ncarefully crossed the floor. \"Here is the bread, and--\" Even he had his\\nmoments of feeling. The appearance of that loaf had stunned him; one\\ncorner of it had been gnawed off.\\n\\n\"A light! let us have a light!\" cried Mr. Fenton, speaking for the first\\ntime since his entrance. \"These moonbeams are horrible; see how they\\ncling to the bodies as if they delighted in lighting up these wasted and\\nshrunken forms.\"\\n\\n\"Could it have been hunger?\" began Abel, tremblingly following Knapp\\'s\\nevery movement as he struck a match and lit a lantern which he had\\nbrought in his pocket.\\n\\n\"God help us all if it was!\" said Fenton, in a secret remorse no one but\\nDr. Talbot understood. \"But who could have believed it of men who were\\nonce so prosperous? Are you sure that one of them has gnawed this bread?\\nCould it not have been--\"\\n\\n\"These are the marks of human teeth,\" observed Knapp, who was examining\\nthe loaf carefully. \"I declare, it makes me very uncomfortable,\\nnotwithstanding it\\'s in the line of regular experiences.\" And he laid\\nthe bread down hurriedly.\\n\\nMeantime, Mr. Fenton, who had been bending over another portion of the\\ntable, turned and walked away to the window.\\n\\n\"I am glad they are dead,\" he muttered. \"They have at least shared the\\nfate of their victims. Take a look under that old handkerchief lying\\nbeside the newspaper, Knapp.\"\\n\\nThe detective did so. A three-edged dagger, with a curiously wrought\\nhandle, met his eye. It had blood dried on its point, and was, as all\\ncould see, the weapon with which Agatha Webb had been killed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXYI\\n\\nLOCAL TALENT AT WORK\\n\\n\\n\"Gentlemen, we have reached the conclusion of this business sooner than\\nI expected,\" announced Knapp. \"If you will give me just ten minutes I\\nwill endeavour to find that large remainder of money we have every\\nreason to think is hidden away in this house.\"\\n\\n\"Stop a minute,\" said the coroner. \"Let me see what book John is holding\\nso tightly. Why,\" he exclaimed, drawing it out and giving it one glance,\\n\"it is a Bible.\"\\n\\nLaying it reverently down he met the detective\\'s astonished glance and\\nseriously remarked:\\n\\n\"There is some incongruity between the presence of this book and the\\ndeed we believe to have been performed down yonder.\"\\n\\n\"None at all,\" quoth the detective. \"It was not the man in the chair,\\nbut the one on the floor, who made use of that dagger. But I wish you\\nhad left it to me to remove that book, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You? and why? What difference would it have made?\"\\n\\n\"I would have noticed between what pages his finger was inserted.\\nNothing like making yourself acquainted with every detail in a case like\\nthis.\"\\n\\nDr. Talbot gazed wistfully at the book. He would have liked to know\\nhimself on what especial passage his friend\\'s eyes had last rested.\\n\\n\"I will stand aside,\" said he, \"and hear your report when you are done.\"\\n\\nThe detective had already begun his investigations.\\n\\n\"Here is a spot of blood,\" said he. \"See! on the right trouser leg of\\nthe one you call James. This connects him indisputably with the crime in\\nwhich this dagger was used. No signs of violence on his body. She was\\nthe only one to receive a blow. His death is the result of God\\'s\\nprovidence.\"\\n\\n\"Or man\\'s neglect,\" muttered the constable.\\n\\n\"There is no money in any of their pockets, or on either wasted figure,\"\\nthe detective continued, after a few minutes of silent search. \"It must\\nbe hidden in the room, or--look through that Bible, sirs.\"\\n\\nThe coroner, glad of an opportunity to do something, took up the book,\\nand ran hurriedly through its leaves, then turned it and shook it out\\nover the table. Nothing fell out; the bills must be looked for\\nelsewhere.\\n\\n\"The furniture is scanty,\" Abel observed, with an inquiring look about\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Very, very scanty,\" assented the constable, still with that biting\\nremorse at his heart.\\n\\n\"There is nothing in this cupboard,\" pursued the detective, swinging\\nopen a door in the wall, \"but a set of old china more or less nicked.\"\\n\\nAbel started. An old recollection had come up. Some weeks before, he had\\nbeen present when James had made an effort to sell this set. They were\\nall in Warner\\'s store, and James Zabel (he could see his easy attitude\\nyet, and hear the off-hand tones with which he tried to carry the affair\\noff) had said, quite as if he had never thought of it before: \"By the\\nby, I have a set of china at the house which came over in the Mayflower.\\nJohn likes it, but it has grown to be an eyesore to me, and if you hear\\nof anybody who has a fancy for such things, send him up to the cottage.\\nI will let it go for a song.\" Nobody answered, and James disappeared. It\\nwas the last time, Abel remembered, that he had been seen about town.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t stand it,\" cried the lad. \"I can\\'t stand it. If they died of\\nhunger I must know it. I am going to take a look at their larder.\" And\\nbefore anyone could stop him he dashed to the rear of the house.\\n\\nThe constable would have liked to follow him, but he looked about the\\nwalls of the room instead. John and James had been fond of pictures and\\nhad once indulged their fancy to the verge of extravagance, but there\\nwere no pictures on the walls now, nor was there so much as a\\ncandlestick on the empty and dust-covered mantel. Only on a bracket in\\none corner there was a worthless trinket made out of cloves and beads\\nwhich had doubtless been given them by some country damsel in their\\nyoung bachelor days. But nothing of any value anywhere, and Mr. Fenton\\nfelt that he now knew why they had made so many visits to Boston at one\\ntime, and why they always returned with a thinner valise than they took\\naway. He was still dwelling on the thought of the depths of misery to\\nwhich highly respectable folks can sink without the knowledge of the\\nnearest neighbours, when Abel came back looking greatly troubled.\\n\\n\"It is the saddest thing I ever heard of,\" said he. \"These men must have\\nbeen driven wild by misery. This room is sumptuous in comparison to the\\nones at the back; and as for the pantry, there is not even a scrap there\\na mouse could eat. I struck a match and glanced into the flour barrel.\\nIt looked as if it had been licked. I declare, it makes a fellow feel\\nsick.\"\\n\\nThe constable, with a shudder, withdrew towards the door.\\n\\n\"The atmosphere here is stifling,\" said he. \"I must have a breath of\\nout-door air.\"\\n\\nBut he was not destined to any such immediate relief. As he moved down\\nthe hall the form of a man darkened the doorway and he heard an anxious\\nvoice exclaim:\\n\\n\"Ah, Mr. Fenton, is that you? I have been looking for you everywhere.\"\\n\\nIt was Sweetwater, the young man who had previously shown so much\\nanxiety to be of service to the coroner.\\n\\nMr. Fenton looked displeased.\\n\\n\"And how came you to find me here?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Oh, some men saw you take this road, and I guessed the rest.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, ah, very good. And what do you want, Sweetwater?\"\\n\\nThe young man, who was glowing with pride and all alive with an\\nenthusiasm which he had kept suppressed for hours, slipped up to the\\nconstable and whispered in his ear: \"I have made a discovery, sir. I\\nknow you will excuse the presumption, but I couldn\\'t bring myself to\\nkeep quiet and follow in that other fellow\\'s wake. I had to make\\ninvestigations on my own account, and--and\"--stammering in his eagerness\\n\"they have been successful, sir. I have found out who was the murderer\\nof Agatha Webb.\"\\n\\nThe constable, compassionating the disappointment in store for him,\\nshook his head, with a solemn look toward the room from which he had\\njust emerged. \"You are late, Sweetwater,\" said he. \"We have found him\\nout ourselves, and he lies there, dead.\"\\n\\nIt was dark where they stood and Sweetwater\\'s back was to the moonlight,\\nso that the blank look which must have crossed his face at this\\nannouncement was lost upon the constable. But his consternation was\\nevident from the way he thrust out either hand to steady himself against\\nthe walls of the narrow passageway, and Mr. Fenton was not at all\\nsurprised to hear him stammer out:\\n\\n\"Dead! He! Whom do you mean by he, Mr. Fenton?\"\\n\\n\"The man in whose house we now are,\" returned the other. \"Is there\\nanyone else who can be suspected of this crime?\"\\n\\nSweetwater gave a gulp that seemed to restore him to himself.\\n\\n\"There are two men living here, both very good men, I have heard. Which\\nof them do you mean, and why do you think that either John or James\\nZabel killed Agatha Webb?\"\\n\\nFor reply Mr. Fenton drew him toward the room in which such a great\\nheart-tragedy had taken place.\\n\\n\"Look,\" said he, \"and see what can happen in a Christian land, in the\\nmidst of Christian people living not fifty rods away. These men are\\ndead, Sweetwater, dead from hunger. The loaf of bread you see there came\\ntoo late. It was bought with a twenty-dollar bill, taken from Agatha\\nWebb\\'s cupboard drawer.\"\\n\\nSweetwater, to whom the whole scene seemed like some horrible nightmare,\\nstared at the figure of James lying on the floor, and then at the figure\\nof John seated at the table, as if his mind had failed to take in the\\nconstable\\'s words.\\n\\n\"Dead!\" he murmured. \"Dead! John and James Zabel. What will happen next?\\nIs the town under a curse?\" And he fell on his knees before the\\nprostrate form of James, only to start up again as he saw the eyes of\\nKnapp resting on him.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" he muttered, \"the detective!\" And after giving the man from Boston\\na close look he turned toward Mr. Fenton.\\n\\n\"You said something about this good old man having killed Agatha Webb.\\nWhat was it? I was too dazed to take it in.\"\\n\\nMr. Fenton, not understanding the young man\\'s eagerness, but willing\\nenough to enlighten him as to the situation, told him what reasons there\\nwere for ascribing the crime in the Webb cottage to the mad need of\\nthese starving men. Sweetwater listened with open eyes and confused\\nbearing, only controlling himself when his eyes by chance fell upon the\\nquiet figure of the detective, now moving softly to and fro through the\\nroom.\\n\\n\"But why murder when he could have had his loaf for the asking?\"\\nremonstrated Sweetwater. \"Agatha Webb would have gone without a meal any\\ntime to feed a wandering tramp; how much more to supply the necessities\\nof two of her oldest and dearest friends!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" remarked Fenton, \"but you forget or perhaps never knew that the\\nmaster passion of these men was pride. James Zabel ask for bread! I can\\nmuch sooner imagine him stealing it; yes, or striking a blow for it, so\\nthat the blow shut forever the eyes that saw him do it.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t believe your own words, Mr. Fenton. How can you?\"\\nSweetwater\\'s hand was on the breast of the accused man as he spoke, and\\nhis manner was almost solemn. \"You must not take it for granted,\" he\\nwent on, his green eyes twinkling with a curious light, \"that all wisdom\\ncomes from Boston. We in Sutherlandtown have some sparks of it, if they\\nhave not yet been recognised. You are satisfied\"--here he addressed\\nhimself to Knapp--\"that the blow which killed Agatha Webb was struck by\\nthis respectable old man?\"\\n\\nKnapp smiled as if a child had asked him this question; but he answered\\nhim good-humouredly enough.\\n\\n\"You see the dagger lying here with which the deed was done, and you see\\nthe bread that was bought from Loton with a twenty-dollar bill of Agatha\\nWebb\\'s money. In these you can read my answer.\"\\n\\n\"Good evidence,\" acknowledged Sweetwater--\"very good evidence,\\nespecially when we remember that Mr. Crane met an old man rushing from\\nher gateway with something glittering in his hand. I never was so beat\\nin my life, and yet--and yet--if I could have a few minutes of quiet\\nthought all by myself I am certain I could show you that there is more\\nto this matter than you think. Indeed, I know that there is, but I do\\nnot like to give my reasons till I have conquered the difficulties\\npresented by these men having had the twenty-dollar bill.\"\\n\\n\"What fellow is this?\" suddenly broke in Knapp.\\n\\n\"A fiddler, a nobody,\" quietly whispered Mr. Fenton in his ear.\\n\\nSweetwater heard him and changed in a twinkling from the uncertain,\\nhalf-baffled, wholly humble person they had just seen, to a man with a\\npurpose strong enough to make him hold up his head with the best.\\n\\n\"I am a musician,\" he admitted, \"and I play on the violin for money\\nwhenever the occasion offers, something which you will yet congratulate\\nyourselves upon if you wish to reach the root of this mysterious and\\ndastardly crime. But that I am a nobody I deny, and I even dare to hope\\nthat you will agree with me in this estimate of myself before this very\\nnight is over. Only give me an opportunity for considering this subject,\\nand the permission to walk for a few minutes about this house.\"\\n\\n\"That is my prerogative,\" protested the detective firmly, but without\\nany display of feeling. \"I am the man employed to pick up whatever clews\\nthe place may present.\"\\n\\n\"Have you picked up all that are to be found in this room?\" asked\\nSweetwater calmly.\\n\\nKnapp shrugged his shoulders. He was very well satisfied with himself.\\n\\n\"Then give me a chance,\" prayed Sweetwater. \"Mr. Fenton,\" he urged more\\nearnestly, \"I am not the fool you take me for. I feel, I know, I have a\\ngenius for this kind of thing, and though I am not prepossessing to look\\nat, and though I do play the fiddle, I swear there are depths to this\\naffair which none of you have as yet sounded. Sirs, where are the nine\\nhundred and eighty dollars in bills which go to make up the clean\\nthousand that was taken from the small drawer at the back of Agatha\\nWebb\\'s cupboard?\"\\n\\n\"They are in some secret hiding-place, no doubt, which we will presently\\ncome upon as we go through the house,\" answered Knapp.\\n\\n\"Umph! Then I advise you to put your hand on them as soon as possible,\"\\nretorted Sweetwater. \"I will confine myself to going over the ground you\\nhave already investigated.\" And with a sudden ignoring of the others\\'\\npresence, which could only have sprung from an intense egotism or from\\nan overwhelming belief in his own theory, he began an investigation of\\nthe room that threw the other\\'s more commonplace efforts entirely in the\\nshade.\\n\\nKnapp, with a slight compression of his lips, which was the sole\\nexpression of anger he ever allowed himself, took up his hat and made\\nhis bow to Mr. Fenton.\\n\\n\"I see,\" said he, \"that the sympathy of those present is with local\\ntalent. Let local talent work, then, sir, and when you feel the need of\\na man of training and experience, send to the tavern on the docks, where\\nI will be found till I am notified that my services are no longer\\nrequired.\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" protested Mr. Fenton. \"This boy\\'s enthusiasm will soon\\nevaporate. Let him fuss away if he will. His petty business need not\\ninterrupt us.\"\\n\\n\"But he understands himself,\" whispered Knapp. \"I should think he had\\nbeen on our own force for years.\"\\n\\n\"All the more reason to see what he\\'s up to. Wait, if only to satisfy\\nyour curiosity. I shan\\'t let many minutes go by before I pull him up.\"\\n\\nKnapp, who was really of a cold and unimpressionable temperament,\\nrefrained from further argument, and confined himself to watching the\\nyoung man, whose movements seemed to fascinate him.\\n\\n\"Astonishing!\" Mr. Fenton heard him mutter to himself. \"He\\'s more like\\nan eel than a man.\" And indeed the way Sweetwater wound himself out and\\nin through that room, seeing everything that came under his eye, was a\\nsight well worth any professional\\'s attention. Pausing before the dead\\nman on the floor, he held the lantern close to the white, worn face.\\n\"Ha!\" said he, picking something from the long beard, \"here\\'s a crumb of\\nthat same bread. Did you see that, Mr. Knapp?\"\\n\\nThe question was so sudden and so sharp that the detective came near\\nreplying to it; but he bethought himself, and said nothing.\\n\\n\"That settles which of the two gnawed the loaf,\" continued Sweetwater.\\n\\nThe next minute he was hovering over the still more pathetic figure of\\nJohn, sitting in the chair.\\n\\n\"Sad! Sad!\" he murmured.\\n\\nSuddenly he laid his finger on a small rent in the old man\\'s faded vest.\\n\"You saw this, of course,\" said he, with a quick glance over his\\nshoulder at the silent detective.\\n\\nNo answer, as before.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a new slit,\" declared the officious youth, looking closer,\\n\"and--yes--there\\'s blood on its edges. Here, take the lantern, Mr.\\nFenton, I must see how the skin looks underneath. Oh, gentlemen, no\\nshirt! The poorest dockhand has a shirt! Brocaded vest and no shirt; but\\nhe\\'s past our pity now. Ah, only a bruise over the heart. Sirs, what did\\nyou make out of this?\"\\n\\nAs none of them had even seen it, Knapp was not the only one to remain\\nsilent.\\n\\n\"Shall I tell you what I make out of it?\" said the lad, rising hurriedly\\nfrom the floor, which he had as hurriedly examined. \"This old man has\\ntried to take his life with the dagger already wet with the blood of\\nAgatha Webb. But his arm was too feeble. The point only pierced the\\nvest, wiping off a little blood in its passage, then the weapon fell\\nfrom his hand and struck the floor, as you will see by the fresh dent in\\nthe old board I am standing on. Have you anything to say against these\\nsimple deductions?\"\\n\\nAgain the detective opened his lips and might have spoken, but\\nSweetwater gave him no chance.\\n\\n\"Where is the letter he was writing?\" he demanded. \"Have any of you seen\\nany paper lying about here?\"\\n\\n\"He was not writing,\" objected Knapp; \"he was reading; reading in that\\nold Bible you see there.\"\\n\\nSweetwater caught up the book, looked it over, and laid it down, with\\nthat same curious twinkle of his eye they had noted in him before.\\n\\n\"He was writing,\" he insisted. \"See, here is his pencil.\" And he showed\\nthem the battered end of a small lead-pencil lying on the edge of his\\nchair.\\n\\n\"Writing at some time,\" admitted Knapp.\\n\\n\"Writing just before the deed,\" insisted Sweetwater. \"Look at the\\nfingers of his right hand. They have not moved since the pencil fell out\\nof them.\"\\n\\n\"The letter, or whatever it was, shall be looked for,\" declared the\\nconstable.\\n\\nSweetwater bowed, his eyes roving restlessly into every nook and corner\\nof the room.\\n\\n\"James was the stronger of the two,\" he remarked; \"yet there is no\\nevidence that he made any attempt at suicide.\"\\n\\n\"How do you know that it was suicide John attempted?\" asked someone.\\n\"Why might not the dagger have fallen from James\\'s hand in an effort to\\nkill his brother?\"\\n\\n\"Because the dent in the floor would have been to the right of the chair\\ninstead of to the left,\" he returned. \"Besides, James\\'s hand would not\\nhave failed so utterly, since he had strength to pick up the weapon\\nafterward and lay it where you found it.\"\\n\\n\"True, we found it lying on the table,\" observed Abel, scratching his\\nhead in forced admiration of his old schoolmate.\\n\\n\"All easy, very easy,\" Sweetwater remarked, seeing the wonder in every\\neye. \"Matters like those are for a child\\'s reading, but what is\\ndifficult, and what I find hard to come by, is how the twenty-dollar\\nbill got into the old man\\'s hand. He found it here, but how--\"\\n\\n\"Found it here? How do you know that?\"\\n\\n\"Gentlemen, that is a point I will make clear to you later, when I have\\nlaid my hand on a certain clew I am anxiously seeking. You know this is\\nnew work for me and I have to advance warily. Did any of you gentlemen,\\nwhen you came into this room, detect the faintest odour of any kind of\\nperfume?\"\\n\\n\"Perfume?\" echoed Abel, with a glance about the musty apartment. \"Rats,\\nrather.\"\\n\\nSweetwater shook his head with a discouraged air, but suddenly\\nbrightened, and stepping quickly across the floor, paused at one of the\\nwindows. It was that one in which the shade had been drawn.\\n\\nPeering at this shade he gave a grunt.\\n\\n\"You must excuse me for a minute,\" said he; \"I have not found what I\\nwanted in this room and now must look outside for it. Will someone bring\\nthe lantern?\"\\n\\n\"I will,\" volunteered Knapp, with grim good humour. Indeed, the\\nsituation was almost ludicrous to him.\\n\\n\"Bring it round the house, then, to the ground under this window,\"\\nordered Sweetwater, without giving any sign that he noticed or even\\nrecognised the other\\'s air of condescension. \"And, gentlemen, please\\ndon\\'t follow. It\\'s footsteps I am after, and the fewer we make\\nourselves, the easier will it be for me to establish the clew I am\\nafter.\"\\n\\nMr. Fenton stared. What had got into the fellow?\\n\\nThe lantern gone, the room resumed its former appearance.\\n\\nAbel, who had been much struck by Sweetwater\\'s mysterious manoeuvres,\\ndrew near Dr. Talbot and whispered in his ear: \"We might have done\\nwithout that fellow from Boston.\"\\n\\nTo which the coroner replied:\\n\\n\"Perhaps so, and perhaps not. Sweetwater has not yet proved his case;\\nlet us wait till he explains himself.\" Then, turning to the constable,\\nhe showed him an old-fashioned miniature, which he had found lying on\\nJames\\'s breast, when he made his first examination. It was set with\\npearls and backed with gold and was worth many meals, for the lack of\\nwhich its devoted owner had perished.\\n\\n\"Agatha Webb\\'s portrait,\" explained Talbot, \"or rather Agatha\\nGilchrist\\'s; for I presume this was painted when she and James were\\nlovers.\"\\n\\n\"She was certainly a beauty,\" commented Fenton, as he bent over the\\nminiature in the moonlight. \"I do not wonder she queened it over the\\nwhole country.\"\\n\\n\"He must have worn it where I found it for the last forty years,\" mused\\nthe doctor. \"And yet men say that love is a fleeting passion. Well,\\nafter coming upon this proof of devotion, I find it impossible to\\nbelieve James Zabel accountable for the death of one so fondly\\nremembered. Sweetwater\\'s instinct was truer than Knapp\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Or ours,\" muttered Fenton.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" interposed Abel, pointing to a bright spot that just then\\nmade its appearance in the dark outline of the shade before alluded to,\\n\"do you see that hole? It was the sight of that prick in the shade which\\nsent Sweetwater outside looking for footprints. See! Now his eye is to\\nit\" (as the bright spot became suddenly eclipsed). \"We are under\\nexamination, sirs, and the next thing we will hear is that he\\'s not the\\nonly person who\\'s been peering into this room through that hole.\"\\n\\nHe was so far right that the first words of Sweetwater on his\\nre-entrance were: \"It\\'s all O. K., sirs. I have found my missing clew.\\nJames Zabel was not the only person who came up here from the Webb\\ncottage last night.\" And turning to Knapp, who was losing some of his\\nsupercilious manner, he asked, with significant emphasis: \"If, of the\\nfull amount stolen from Agatha Webb, you found twenty dollars in the\\npossession of one man and nine hundred and eighty dollars in the\\npossession of another, upon which of the two would you fix as the\\nprobable murderer of the good woman?\"\\n\\n\"Upon him who held the lion\\'s share, of course.\"\\n\\n\"Very good; then it is not in this cottage you will find the person most\\nwanted. You must look--But there! first let me give you a glimpse of the\\nmoney. Is there anyone here ready to accompany me in search of it? I\\nshall have to take him a quarter of a mile farther up-hill.\"\\n\\n\"You have seen the money? You know where it is?\" asked Dr. Talbot and\\nMr. Fenton in one breath.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen, I can put my hand on it in ten minutes.\"\\n\\nAt this unexpected and somewhat startling statement Knapp looked at Dr.\\nTalbot and Dr. Talbot looked at the constable, but only the last spoke.\\n\\n\"That is saying a good deal. But no matter. I am willing to credit the\\nassertion. Lead on, Sweetwater; I\\'ll go with you.\"\\n\\nSweetwater seemed to grow an inch taller in his satisfied vanity. \"And\\nDr. Talbot?\" he suggested.\\n\\nBut the coroner\\'s duty held him to the house and he decided not to\\naccompany them. Knapp and Abel, however, yielded to the curiosity which\\nhad been aroused by these extraordinary promises, and presently the four\\nmen mentioned started on their small expedition up the hill.\\n\\nSweetwater headed the procession. He had admonished silence, and his\\nwish in this regard was so well carried out that they looked more like a\\ngroup of spectres moving up the moon-lighted road, than a party of eager\\nand impatient men. Not till they turned into the main thoroughfare did\\nanyone speak. Then Abel could no longer restrain himself and he cried\\nout:\\n\\n\"We are going to Mr. Sutherland\\'s.\"\\n\\nBut Sweetwater quickly undeceived him.\\n\\n\"No,\" said he, \"only into the woods opposite his house.\"\\n\\nBut at this Mr. Fenton drew him back.\\n\\n\"Are you sure of yourself?\" he said. \"Have you really seen this money\\nand is it concealed in this forest?\"\\n\\n\"I have seen the money,\" Sweetwater solemnly declared, \"and it is hidden\\nin these woods.\"\\n\\nMr. Fenton dropped his arm, and they moved on till their way was blocked\\nby the huge trunk of a fallen tree.\\n\\n\"It is here we are to look,\" cried Sweetwater, pausing and motioning\\nKnapp to turn his lantern on the spot where the shadows lay thickest.\\n\"Now, what do you see?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"The upturned roots of a great tree,\" said Mr. Fenton.\\n\\n\"And under them?\"\\n\\n\"A hole, or, rather, the entrance to one.\"\\n\\n\"Very good; the money is in that hole. Pull it out, Mr. Fenton.\"\\n\\nThe assurance with which Sweetwater spoke was such that Mr. Fenton at\\nonce stooped and plunged his hand into the hole. But when, after a\\nhurried search, he drew it out again, there was nothing in it; the place\\nwas empty. Sweetwater stared at Mr. Fenton amazed.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you find anything?\" he asked. \"Isn\\'t there a roll of bills in\\nthat hole?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" was the gloomy answer, after a renewed attempt and a second\\ndisappointment. \"There is nothing to be found here. You are labouring\\nunder some misapprehension, Sweetwater.\"\\n\\n\"But I can\\'t be. I saw the money; saw it in the hand of the person who\\nhid it there. Let me look for it, constable. I will not give up the\\nsearch till I have turned the place topsy-turvy.\"\\n\\nKneeling down in Mr. Fenton\\'s place, he thrust his hand into the hole.\\nOn either side of him peered the faces of Mr. Fenton and Knapp. (Abel\\nhad slipped away at a whisper from Sweetwater.) They were lit with a\\nsimilar expression of anxious interest and growing doubt. His own\\ncountenance was a study of conflicting and by no means cheerful\\nemotions. Suddenly his aspect changed. With a quick twist of his lithe,\\nif awkward, body, he threw himself lengthwise on the ground, and began\\ntearing at the earth inside the hole, like a burrowing animal.\\n\\n\"I cannot be mistaken. Nothing will make me believe it is not here. It\\nhas simply been buried deeper than I thought. Ah! What did I tell you?\\nSee here! And see here!\"\\n\\nBringing his hands into the full blaze of the light, he showed two rolls\\nof new, crisp bills.\\n\\n\"They were lying under half a foot of earth,\" said he, \"but if they had\\nbeen buried as deep as Grannie Fuller\\'s well, I\\'d have unearthed them.\"\\n\\nMeantime Mr. Fenton was rapidly counting one roll and Knapp the other.\\nThe result was an aggregate sum of nine hundred and eighty dollars, just\\nthe amount Sweetwater had promised to show them.\\n\\n\"A good stroke of business,\" cried Mr. Fenton. \"And now, Sweetwater,\\nwhose is the hand that buried this treasure? Nothing is to be gained by\\npreserving silence on this point any longer.\"\\n\\nInstantly the young man became very grave. With a quick glance around\\nwhich seemed to embrace the secret recesses of the forest rather than\\nthe eager faces bending towards him, he lowered his voice and quietly\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"The hand that buried this money under the roots of this old tree is the\\nsame which you saw pointing downward at the spot of blood in Agatha\\nWebb\\'s front yard.\"\\n\\n\"You do not mean Amabel Page!\" cried Mr. Fenton, with natural surprise.\\n\\n\"Yes, I do; and I am glad it is you who have named her.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVII\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERS, THE FLOWER, AND WHAT SWEETWATER MADE OF THEM\\n\\n\\nA half-hour later these men were all closeted with Dr. Talbot in the\\nZabel kitchen. Abel had rejoined them, and Sweetwater was telling his\\nstory with great earnestness and no little show of pride.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen, when I charge a young woman of respectable appearance and\\nconnections with such a revolting crime as murder, I do so with good\\nreason, as I hope presently to make plain to you all.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen, on the night and at the hour Agatha Webb was killed, I was\\nplaying with four other musicians in Mr. Sutherland\\'s hallway. From the\\nplace where I sat I could see what went on in the parlour and also have\\na clear view of the passageway leading down to the garden door. As the\\ndancing was going on in the parlour I naturally looked that way most,\\nand this is how I came to note the eagerness with which, during the\\nfirst part of the evening, Frederick Sutherland and Amabel Page came\\ntogether in the quadrilles and country dances. Sometimes she spoke as\\nshe passed him, and sometimes he answered, but not always, although he\\nnever failed to show he was pleased with her or would have been if\\nsomething--perhaps it was his lack of confidence in her, sirs--had not\\nstood in the way of a perfect understanding. She seemed to notice that\\nhe did not always respond, and after a while showed less inclination to\\nspeak herself, though she did not fail to watch him, and that intently.\\nBut she did not watch him any more closely than I did her, though I\\nlittle thought at the time what would come of my espionage. She wore a\\nwhite dress and white shoes, and was as coquettish and seductive as the\\nevil one makes them. Suddenly I missed her. She was in the middle of the\\ndance one minute and entirely out of it the next. Naturally I supposed\\nher to have slipped aside with Frederick Sutherland, but he was still in\\nsight, looking so pale and so abstracted, however, I was sure the young\\nmiss was up to some sort of mischief. But what mischief? Watching and\\nwaiting, but no longer confining my attention to the parlour, I\\npresently espied her stealing along the passageway I have mentioned,\\ncarrying a long cloak which she rolled up and hid behind the open door.\\nThen she came back humming a gay little song which didn\\'t deceive me for\\na moment. \\'Good!\\' thought I, \\'she and that cloak will soon join\\ncompany.\\' And they did. As we were playing the Harebell mazurka I again\\ncaught sight of her stealthy white figure in that distant doorway.\\nSeizing the cloak, she wrapped it round her, and with just one furtive\\nlook backwards, seen, I warrant, by no one but myself, she vanished in\\nthe outside dark. \\'Now to note who follows her!\\' But nobody followed\\nher. This struck me as strange, and having a natural love for detective\\nwork, in spite of my devotion to the arts, I consulted the clock at the\\nfoot of the stairs, and noting that it was half-past eleven, scribbled\\nthe hour on the margin of my music, with the intention of seeing how\\nlong my lady would linger outside alone. Gentlemen, it was two hours\\nbefore I saw her face again. How she got back into the house I do not\\nknow. It was not by the garden door, for my eye seldom left it; yet at\\nor near half-past one I heard her voice on the stair above me and saw\\nher descend and melt into the crowd as if she had not been absent from\\nit for more than five minutes. A half-hour later I saw her with\\nFrederick again. They were dancing, but not with the same spirit as\\nbefore, and even while I watched them they separated. Now where was Miss\\nPage during those two long hours? I think I know, and it is time I\\nunburdened myself to the police.\\n\\n\"But first I must inform you of a small discovery I made while the dance\\nwas still in progress. Miss Page had descended the stairs, as I have\\nsaid, from what I now know to have been her own room. Her dress was, in\\nall respects, the same as before, with one exception--her white slippers\\nhad been exchanged for blue ones. This seemed to show that they had been\\nrendered unserviceable, or at least unsightly, by the walk she had\\ntaken. This in itself was not remarkable nor would her peculiar escapade\\nhave made more than a temporary impression upon my curiosity if she had\\nnot afterward shown in my presence such an unaccountable and\\nextraordinary interest in the murder which had taken place in the town\\nbelow during the very hours of her absence from Mr. Sutherland\\'s ball.\\nThis, in consideration of her sex, and her being a stranger to the\\nperson attacked, was remarkable, and, though perhaps I had no business\\nto do what I did, I no sooner saw the house emptied of master and\\nservants than I stole softly back, and climbed the stairs to her room.\\nHad no good followed this intrusion, which, I am quite ready to\\nacknowledge, was a trifle presumptuous, I would have held my peace in\\nregard to it; but as I did make a discovery there, which has, as I\\nbelieve, an important bearing on this affair, I have forced myself to\\nmention it. The lights in the house having been left burning, I had no\\ndifficulty in finding her apartment. I knew it by the folderols\\nscattered about. But I did not stop to look at them. I was on a search\\nfor her slippers, and presently came upon them, thrust behind an old\\npicture in the dimmest corner of the room. Taking them down, I examined\\nthem closely. They were not only soiled, gentlemen, but dreadfully cut\\nand rubbed. In short, they were ruined, and, thinking that the young\\nlady herself would be glad to be rid of them, I quietly put them into my\\npocket, and carried them to my own home. Abel has just been for them, so\\nyou can see them for yourselves, and if your judgment coincides with\\nmine, you will discover something more on them than mud.\"\\n\\nDr. Talbot, though he stared a little at the young man\\'s confessed\\ntheft, took the slippers Abel was holding out and carefully turned them\\nover. They were, as Sweetwater had said, grievously torn and soiled, and\\nshowed, beside several deep earth-stains, a mark or two of a bright red\\ncolour, quite unmistakable in its character.\\n\\n\"Blood,\" declared the coroner. \"There is no doubt about it. Miss Page\\nwas where blood was spilled last night.\"\\n\\n\"I have another proof against her,\" Sweetwater went on, in full\\nenjoyment of his prominence amongst these men, who, up to now, had\\nbarely recognised his existence. \"When, full of the suspicion that Miss\\nPage had had a hand in the theft which had taken place at Mrs. Webb\\'s\\nhouse, if not in the murder that accompanied it, I hastened down to the\\nscene of the tragedy, I met this young woman issuing from the front\\ngate. She had just been making herself conspicuous by pointing out a\\ntrail of blood on the grass plot. Dr. Talbot, who was there, will\\nremember how she looked on that occasion; but I doubt if he noticed how\\nAbel here looked, or so much as remarked the faded flower the silly boy\\nhad stuck in his buttonhole.\"\\n\\n\"--me if I did!\" ejaculated the coroner.\\n\\n\"Yet that flower has a very important bearing on this case. He had found\\nit, as he will tell you, on the floor near Batsy\\'s skirts, and as soon\\nas I saw it in his coat, I bade him take it out and keep it, for,\\ngentlemen, it was a very uncommon flower, the like of which can only be\\nfound in this town in Mr. Sutherland\\'s conservatory. I remember seeing\\nsuch a one in Miss Page\\'s hair, early in the evening. Have you that\\nflower about you, Abel?\"\\n\\nAbel had, and being filled with importance too, showed it to the doctor\\nand to Mr. Fenton. It was withered and faded in hue, but it was\\nunmistakably an orchid of the rarest description.\\n\\n\"It was lying near Batsy,\" explained Abel. \"I drew Mr. Fenton\\'s\\nattention to it at the time, but he scarcely noticed it.\"\\n\\n\"I will make up for my indifference now,\" said that gentleman.\\n\\n\"I should have been shown that flower,\" put in Knapp.\\n\\n\"So you should,\" acknowledged Sweetwater, \"but when the detective\\ninstinct is aroused it is hard for a man to be just to his rivals;\\nbesides, I was otherwise occupied. I had Miss Page to watch. Happily for\\nme, you had decided that she should not be allowed to leave town till\\nafter the inquest, and so my task became easy. This whole day I have\\nspent in sight of Mr. Sutherland\\'s house, and at nightfall I was\\nrewarded by detecting her end a prolonged walk in the garden by a\\nhurried dash into the woods opposite. I followed her and noted carefully\\nall that she did. As she had just seen Frederick Sutherland and Miss\\nHalliday disappear up the road together, she probably felt free to do as\\nshe liked, for she walked very directly to the old tree we have just\\ncome from, and kneeling down beside it pulled from the hole underneath\\nsomething which rattled in her hand with that peculiar sound we\\nassociate with fresh bank-notes. I had approached her as near as I\\ndared, and was peering around a tree trunk, when she stooped down again\\nand plunged both hands into the hole. She remained in this position so\\nlong that I did not know what to make of it. But she rose at last and\\nturned toward home, laughing to herself in a wicked but pleased way that\\ndid not tend to make me think any more of her. The moon was shining very\\nbrightly by this time and I could readily perceive every detail of her\\nperson. She held her hands out before her and shook them more than once\\nas she trod by me, so I was sure there was nothing in them, and this is\\nwhy I was so confident we should find the money still in the hole.\\n\\n\"When I saw her enter the house, I set out to find you, but the\\ncourt-house room was empty, and it was a long time before I learned\\nwhere to look for you. But at last a fellow at Brighton\\'s corner said he\\nsaw four men go by on their way to Zabel\\'s cottage, and on the chance of\\nfinding you amongst them, I turned down here. The shock you gave me in\\nannouncing that you had discovered the murderer of Agatha Webb knocked\\nme over for a moment, but now I hope you realise, as I do, that this\\nwretched man could never have had an active hand in her death,\\nnotwithstanding the fact that one of the stolen bills has been found in\\nhis possession. For, and here is my great point, the proof is not\\nwanting that Miss Page visited this house as well as Mrs. Webb\\'s during\\nher famous escapade; or at least stood under the window beneath which I\\nhave just been searching. A footprint can be seen there, sirs, a very\\nplain footprint, and if Dr. Talbot will take the trouble to compare it\\nwith the slipper he holds in his hand, he will find it to have been made\\nby the foot that wore that slipper.\"\\n\\nThe coroner, with a quick glance from the slipper in his hand up to\\nSweetwater\\'s eager face, showed a decided disposition to make the\\nexperiment thus suggested. But Mr. Fenton, whose mind was full of the\\nZabel tragedy, interrupted them with the question:\\n\\n\"But how do you explain by this hypothesis the fact of James Zabel\\ntrying to pass one of the twenty-dollar bills stolen from Mrs. Webb\\'s\\ncupboard? Do you consider Miss Page generous enough to give him that\\nmoney?\"\\n\\n\"You ask ME that, Mr. Fenton. Do you wish to know what _I_ think of the\\nconnection between these two great tragedies?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; you have earned a voice in this matter; speak, Sweetwater.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, I think Miss Page has made an effort to throw the blame of\\nher own misdoing on one or both of these unfortunate old men. She is\\nsufficiently cold-blooded and calculating to do so; and circumstances\\ncertainly favoured her. Shall I show how?\"\\n\\nMr. Fenton consulted Knapp, who nodded his head. The Boston detective\\nwas not without curiosity as to how Sweetwater would prove the case.\\n\\n\"Old James Zabel had seen his brother sinking rapidly from inanition;\\nthis their condition amply shows. He was weak himself, but John was\\nweaker, and in a moment of desperation he rushed out to ask a crumb of\\nbread from Agatha Webb, or possibly--for I have heard some whispers of\\nan old custom of theirs to join Philemon at his yearly merry-making and\\nso obtain in a natural way the bite for himself and brother he perhaps\\nhad not the courage to ask for outright. But death had been in the Webb\\ncottage before him, which awful circumstance, acting on his already\\nweakened nerves, drove him half insane from the house and sent him\\nwandering blindly about the streets for a good half-hour before he\\nreappeared in his own house. How do I know this? From a very simple\\nfact. Abel here has been to inquire, among other things, if Mr. Crane\\nremembers the tune we were playing at the great house when he came down\\nthe main street from visiting old widow Walker. Fortunately he does, for\\nthe trip, trip, trip in it struck his fancy, and he has found himself\\nhumming it over more than once since. Well, that waltz was played by us\\nat a quarter after midnight, which fixes the time of the encounter at\\nMrs. Webb\\'s gateway pretty accurately. But, as you will soon see, it was\\nten minutes to one before James Zabel knocked at Loton\\'s door. How do I\\nknow this? By the same method of reasoning by which I determined the\\ntime of Mr. Crane\\'s encounter. Mrs. Loton was greatly pleased with the\\nmusic played that night, and had all her windows open in order to hear\\nit, and she says we were playing \\'Money Musk\\' when that knocking came to\\ndisturb her. Now, gentlemen, we played \\'Money Musk\\' just before we were\\ncalled out to supper, and as we went to supper promptly at one, you can\\nsee just how my calculation was made. Thirty-five minutes, then, passed\\nbetween the moment James Zabel was seen rushing from Mrs. Webb\\'s gateway\\nand that in which he appeared at Loton\\'s bakery, demanding a loaf of\\nbread, and offering in exchange one of the bills which had been stolen\\nfrom the murdered woman\\'s drawer. Thirty-five minutes! And he and his\\nbrother were starving. Does it look, then, as if that money was in his\\npossession when he left Mrs. Webb\\'s house? Would any man who felt the\\npangs of hunger as he did, or who saw a brother perishing for food\\nbefore his eyes, allow thirty-five minutes to elapse before he made use\\nof the money that rightfully or wrongfully had come into his hand? No;\\nand so I say that he did not have it when Mr. Crane met him. That,\\ninstead of committing crime to obtain it, he found it in his own home,\\nlying on his table, when, after his frenzied absence, he returned to\\ntell his dreadful news to the brother he had left behind him. But how\\ndid it come there? you ask. Gentlemen, remember the footprints under the\\nwindow. Amabel Page brought it. Having seen or perhaps met this old man\\nroaming in or near the Webb cottage during the time she was there\\nherself, she conceived the plan of throwing upon him the onus of the\\ncrime she had herself committed, and with a slyness to be expected from\\none so crafty, stole up to his home, made a hole in the shade hanging\\nover an open window, looked into the room where John sat, saw that he\\nwas there alone and asleep, and, creeping in by the front door, laid on\\nthe table beside him the twenty-dollar bill and the bloody dagger with\\nwhich she had just slain Agatha Webb. Then she stole out again, and in\\ntwenty minutes more was leading the dance in Mr. Sutherland\\'s parlour.\"\\n\\n\"Well reasoned!\" murmured Abel, expecting the others to echo him. But,\\nthough Mr. Fenton and Dr. Talbot looked almost convinced, they said\\nnothing, while Knapp, of course, was quiet as an oyster.\\n\\nSweetwater, with an easy smile calculated to hide his disappointment,\\nwent on as if perfectly satisfied.\\n\\n\"Meanwhile John awakes, sees the dagger, and thinks to end his misery\\nwith it, but finds himself too feeble. The cut in his vest, the dent in\\nthe floor, prove this, but if you call for further proof, a little fact,\\nwhich some, if not all, of you seem to have overlooked, will amply\\nsatisfy you that this one at least of my conclusions is correct. Open\\nthe Bible, Abel; open it, not to shake it for what will never fall from\\nbetween its leaves, but to find in the Bible itself the lines I have\\ndeclared to you he wrote as a dying legacy with that tightly clutched\\npencil. Have you found them?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" was Abel\\'s perplexed retort; \"I cannot see any sign of writing on\\nflyleaf or margin.\"\\n\\n\"Are those the only blank places in the sacred book? Search the leaves\\ndevoted to the family record. Now! what do you find there?\"\\n\\nKnapp, who was losing some of his indifference, drew nearer and read for\\nhimself the scrawl which now appeared to every eye on the discoloured\\npage which Abel here turned uppermost.\\n\\n\"Almost illegible,\" he said; \"one can just make out these words:\\n\\'Forgive me, James--tried to use dagger--found lying--but hand\\nwouldn\\'t--dying without--don\\'t grieve--true men--haven\\'t disgraced\\nourselves--God bless--\\' That is all.\"\\n\\n\"The effort must have overcome him,\" resumed Sweetwater in a voice from\\nwhich he carefully excluded all signs of secret triumph, \"and when James\\nreturned, as he did a few minutes later, he was evidently unable to ask\\nquestions, even if John was in a condition to answer them. But the\\nfallen dagger told its own story, for James picked it up and put it back\\non the table, and it was at this minute he saw, what John had not, the\\ntwenty-dollar bill lying there with its promise of life and comfort.\\nHope revives; he catches up the bill, flies down to Loton\\'s, procures a\\nloaf of bread, and comes frantically back, gnawing it as he runs; for\\nhis own hunger is more than he can endure. Re-entering his brother\\'s\\npresence, he rushes forward with the bread. But the relief has come too\\nlate; John has died in his absence; and James, dizzy with the shock,\\nreels back and succumbs to his own misery. Gentlemen, have you anything\\nto say in contradiction to these various suppositions?\"\\n\\nFor a moment Dr. Talbot, Mr. Fenton, and even Knapp stood silent; then\\nthe last remarked, with pardonable dryness:\\n\\n\"All this is ingenious, but, unfortunately, it is up set by a little\\nfact which you yourself have overlooked. Have you examined attentively\\nthe dagger of which you have so often spoken, Mr. Sweetwater?\"\\n\\n\"Not as I would like to, but I noticed it had blood on its edge, and was\\nof the shape and size necessary to inflict the wound from which Mrs.\\nWebb died.\"\\n\\n\"Very good, but there is something else of interest to be observed on\\nit. Fetch it, Abel.\"\\n\\nAbel, hurrying from the room, soon brought back the weapon in question.\\nSweetwater, with a vague sense of disappointment disturbing him, took it\\neagerly and studied it very closely. But he only shook his head.\\n\\n\"Bring it nearer to the light,\" suggested Knapp, \"and examine the little\\nscroll near the top of the handle.\"\\n\\nSweetwater did so, and at once changed colour. In the midst of the\\nscroll were two very small but yet perfectly distinct letters; they were\\nJ. Z.\\n\\n\"How did Amabel Page come by a dagger marked with the Zabel initials?\"\\nquestioned Knapp. \"Do you think her foresight went so far as to provide\\nherself with a dagger ostensibly belonging to one of these brothers? And\\nthen, have you forgotten that when Mr. Crane met the old man at Mrs.\\nWebb\\'s gateway he saw in his hand something that glistened? Now what was\\nthat, if not this dagger?\"\\n\\nSweetwater was more disturbed than he cared to acknowledge.\\n\\n\"That just shows my lack of experience,\" he grumbled. \"I thought I had\\nturned this subject so thoroughly over in my mind that no one could\\nbring an objection against it.\"\\n\\nKnapp shook his head and smiled. \"Young enthusiasts like yourself are\\ngreat at forming theories which well-seasoned men like myself must\\nregard as fantastical. However,\" he went on, \"there is no doubt that\\nMiss Page was a witness to, even if she has not profited by, the murder\\nwe have been considering. But, with this palpable proof of the Zabels\\'\\ndirect connection with the affair, I would not recommend her arrest as\\nyet.\"\\n\\n\"She should be under surveillance, though,\" intimated the coroner.\\n\\n\"Most certainly,\" acquiesced Knapp.\\n\\nAs for Sweetwater, he remained silent till the opportunity came for him\\nto whisper apart to Dr. Talbot, when he said:\\n\\n\"For all the palpable proof of which Mr. Knapp speaks--the J. Z. on the\\ndagger, and the possibility of this being the object he was seen\\ncarrying out of Philemon Webb\\'s gate--I maintain that this old man in\\nhis moribund condition never struck the blow that killed Agatha Webb. He\\nhadn\\'t strength enough, even if his lifelong love for her had not been\\nsufficient to prevent him.\"\\n\\nThe coroner looked thoughtful.\\n\\n\"You are right,\" said he; \"he hadn\\'t strength enough. But don\\'t expend\\ntoo much energy in talk. Wait and see what a few direct questions will\\nelicit from Miss Page.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVIII\\n\\nSOME LEADING QUESTIONS\\n\\n\\nFrederick rose early. He had slept but little. The words he had\\noverheard at the end of the lot the night before were still ringing in\\nhis ears. Going down the back stairs, in his anxiety to avoid Amabel, he\\ncame upon one of the stablemen.\\n\\n\"Been to the village this morning?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"No, sir, but Lem has. There\\'s great news there. I wonder if anyone has\\ntold Mr. Sutherland.\"\\n\\n\"What news, Jake? I don\\'t think my father is up yet.\"\\n\\n\"Why, sir, there were two more deaths in town last night--the brothers\\nZabel; and folks do say (Lem heard it a dozen times between the grocery\\nand the fish market) that it was one of these old men who killed Mrs.\\nWebb. The dagger has been found in their house, and most of the money.\\nWhy, sir, what\\'s the matter? Are you sick?\"\\n\\nFrederick made an effort and stood upright. He had nearly fallen.\\n\\n\"No; that is, I am not quite myself. So many horrors, Jake. What did\\nthey die of? You say they are both dead--both?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, and it\\'s dreadful to think of, but it was hunger, sir. Bread\\ncame too late. Both men are mere skeletons to look at. They have kept\\nthemselves close for weeks now, and nobody knew how bad off they were. I\\ndon\\'t wonder it upset you, sir. We all feel it a bit, and I just dread\\nto tell Mr. Sutherland.\"\\n\\nFrederick staggered away. He had never in his life been so near mental\\nand physical collapse. At the threshold of the sitting-room door he met\\nhis father. Mr. Sutherland was looking both troubled and anxious; more\\nso, Frederick thought, than when he signed the check for him on the\\nprevious night. As their eyes met, both showed embarrassment, but\\nFrederick, whose nerves had been highly strung by what he had just\\nheard, soon controlled himself, and surveying his father with forced\\ncalmness, began:\\n\\n\"This is dreadful news, sir.\"\\n\\nBut his father, intent on his own thought, hurriedly interrupted him.\\n\\n\"You told me yesterday that everything was broken off between you and\\nMiss Page. Yet I saw you reenter the house together last night a little\\nwhile after I gave you the money you asked for.\"\\n\\n\"I know, and it must have had a bad appearance. I entreat you, however,\\nto believe that this meeting between Miss Page and myself was against my\\nwish, and that the relations between us have not been affected by\\nanything that passed between us.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad to hear it, my son. You could not do worse by yourself than\\nto return to your old devotion.\"\\n\\n\"I agree with you, sir.\" And then, because he could not help it,\\nFrederick inquired if he had heard the news.\\n\\nMr. Sutherland, evidently startled, asked what news; to which Frederick\\nreplied:\\n\\n\"The news about the Zabels. They are both dead, sir,--dead from hunger.\\nCan you imagine it!\"\\n\\nThis was something so different from what his father had expected to\\nhear, that he did not take it in at first. When he did, his surprise and\\ngrief were even greater than Frederick had anticipated. Seeing him so\\naffected, Frederick, who thought that the whole truth would be no harder\\nto bear than the half, added the suspicion which had been attached to\\nthe younger one\\'s name, and then stood back, scarcely daring to be a\\nwitness to the outraged feelings which such a communication could not\\nfail to awaken in one of his father\\'s temperament.\\n\\nBut though he thus escaped the shocked look which crossed his father\\'s\\ncountenance, he could not fail to hear the indignant exclamation which\\nburst from his lips, nor help perceiving that it would take more than\\nthe most complete circumstantial evidence to convince his father of the\\nguilt of men he had known and respected for so many years.\\n\\nFor some reason Frederick experienced great relief at this, and was\\nbracing himself to meet the fire of questions which his statement must\\nnecessarily call forth, when the sound of approaching steps drew the\\nattention of both towards a party of men coming up the hillside.\\n\\nAmong them was Mr. Courtney, Prosecuting Attorney for the district, and\\nas Mr. Sutherland recognised him he sprang forward, saying, \"There\\'s\\nCourtney; he will explain this.\"\\n\\nFrederick followed, anxious and bewildered, and soon had the doubtful\\npleasure of seeing his father enter his study in company with the four\\nmen considered to be most interested in the elucidation of the Webb\\nmystery.\\n\\nAs he was lingering in an undecided mood in the small passageway leading\\nup-stairs he felt the pressure of a finger on his shoulder. Looking up,\\nhe met the eyes of Amabel, who was leaning toward him over the\\nbanisters. She was smiling, and, though her face was not without\\nevidences of physical languor, there was a charm about her person which\\nwould have been sufficiently enthralling to him twenty-four hours\\nbefore, but which now caused him such a physical repulsion that he\\nstarted back in the effort to rid his shoulder from her disturbing\\ntouch.\\n\\nShe frowned. It was an instantaneous expression of displeasure which was\\nsoon lost in one of her gurgling laughs.\\n\\n\"Is my touch so burdensome?\" she demanded. \"If the pressure of one\\nfinger is so unbearable to your sensitive nerves, how will you relish\\nthe weight of my whole hand?\"\\n\\nThere was a fierceness in her tone, a purpose in her look, that for the\\nfirst time in his struggle with her revealed the full depth of her dark\\nnature. Shrinking from her appalled, he put up his hand in protest, at\\nwhich she changed again in a twinkling, and with a cautious gesture\\ntoward the room into which Mr. Sutherland and his friends had\\ndisappeared, she whispered significantly:\\n\\n\"We may not have another chance to confer together. Understand, then,\\nthat it will not be necessary for you to tell me, in so many words, that\\nyou are ready to link your fortunes to mine; the taking off of the ring\\nyou wear and your slow putting of it on again, in my presence, will be\\nunderstood by me as a token that you have reconsidered your present\\nattitude and desire my silence and--myself.\"\\n\\nFrederick could not repress a shudder.\\n\\nFor an instant he was tempted to succumb on the spot and have the long\\nagony over. Then his horror of the woman rose to such a pitch that he\\nuttered an execration, and, turning away from her face, which was\\nrapidly growing loathsome to him, he ran out of the passageway into the\\ngarden, seeing as he ran a persistent vision of himself pulling off the\\nring and putting it back again, under the spell of a look he rebelled\\nagainst even while he yielded to its influence.\\n\\n\"I will not wear a ring, I will not subject myself to the possibility of\\nobeying her behest under a sudden stress of fear or fascination,\" he\\nexclaimed, pausing by the well-curb and looking over it at his\\nreflection in the water beneath. \"If I drop it here I at least lose the\\nhorror of doing what she suggests, under some involuntary impulse.\" But\\nthe thought that the mere absence of the ring from his finger would not\\nstand in the way of his going through the motions to which she had just\\ngiven such significance, deterred him from the sacrifice of a valuable\\nfamily jewel, and he left the spot with an air of frenzy such as a man\\ndisplays when he feels himself on the verge of a doom he can neither\\nmeet nor avert.\\n\\nAs he re-entered the house, he felt himself enveloped in the atmosphere\\nof a coming crisis. He could hear voices in the upper hall, and amongst\\nthem he caught the accents of her he had learned so lately to fear.\\nImpelled by something deeper than curiosity and more potent even than\\ndread, he hastened toward the stairs. When half-way up, he caught sight\\nof Amabel. She was leaning back against the balustrade that ran across\\nthe upper hall, with her hands gripping the rail on either side of her\\nand her face turned toward the five men who had evidently issued from\\nMr. Sutherland\\'s study to interview her.\\n\\nAs her back was to Frederick he could not judge of the expression of\\nthat face save by the effect it had upon the different men confronting\\nher. But to see them was enough. From their looks he could perceive that\\nthis young girl was in one of her baffling moods, and that from his\\nfather down, not one of the men present knew what to make of her.\\n\\nAt the sound his feet made, a relaxation took place in her body and she\\nlost something of the defiant attitude she had before maintained.\\nPresently he heard her voice:\\n\\n\"I am willing to answer any questions you may choose to put to me here;\\nbut I cannot consent to shut myself in with you in that small study; I\\nshould suffocate.\"\\n\\nFrederick could perceive the looks which passed between the five men\\nassembled before her, and was astonished to note that the insignificant\\nfellow they called Sweetwater was the first to answer.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said he; \"if you enjoy the publicity of the open hall, no\\none here will object. Is not that so, gentlemen?\"\\n\\nHer two little fingers, which were turned towards Frederick, ran up and\\ndown the rail, making a peculiar rasping noise, which for a moment was\\nthe only sound to be heard. Then Mr. Courtney said:\\n\\n\"How came you to have the handling of the money taken from Agatha Webb\\'s\\nprivate drawer?\"\\n\\nIt was a startling question, but it seemed to affect Amabel less than it\\ndid Frederick. It made him start, but she only turned her head a trifle\\naside, so that the peculiar smile with which she prepared to answer\\ncould be seen by anyone standing below.\\n\\n\"Suppose you ask something less leading than that, to begin with,\" she\\nsuggested, in her high, unmusical voice. \"From the searching nature of\\nthis inquiry, you evidently believe I have information of an important\\ncharacter to give you concerning Mrs. Webb\\'s unhappy death. Ask me about\\nthat; the other question I will answer later.\"\\n\\nThe aplomb with which this was said, mixed as it was with a feminine\\nallurement of more than ordinary subtlety, made Mr. Sutherland frown and\\nDr. Talbot look perplexed, but it did not embarrass Mr. Courtney, who\\nmade haste to respond in his dryest accents:\\n\\n\"Very well, I am not particular as to what you answer first. A flower\\nworn by you at the dance was found near Batsy\\'s skirts, before she was\\nlifted up that morning. Can you explain this, or, rather, will you?\"\\n\\n\"You are not obliged to, you know,\" put in Mr. Sutherland, with his\\ninexorable sense of justice. \"Still, if you would, it might rob these\\ngentlemen of suspicions you certainly cannot wish them to entertain.\"\\n\\n\"What I say,\" she remarked slowly, \"will be as true to the facts as if I\\nstood here on my oath. I can explain how a flower from my hair came to\\nbe in Mrs. Webb\\'s house, but not how it came to be found under Batsy\\'s\\nfeet. That someone else must clear up.\" Her little finger, lifted from\\nthe rail, pointed toward Frederick, but no one saw this, unless it was\\nthat gentleman himself. \"I wore a purple orchid in my hair that night,\\nand there would be nothing strange in its being afterward picked up in\\nMrs. Webb\\'s house, because I was in that house at or near the time she\\nwas murdered.\"\\n\\n\"You in that house?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, as far as the ground floor; no farther.\" Here the little finger\\nstopped pointing. \"I am ready to tell you about it, sirs, and only\\nregret I have delayed doing so so long, but I wished to be sure it was\\nnecessary. Your presence here and your first question show that it is.\"\\n\\nThere was suavity in her tone now, not unmixed with candour. Sweetwater\\ndid not seem to relish this, for he moved uneasily and lost a shade of\\nhis self-satisfied attitude. He had still to be made acquainted with all\\nthe ins and outs of this woman\\'s remarkable nature.\\n\\n\"We are waiting,\" suggested Dr. Talbot.\\n\\nShe turned to face this new speaker, and Frederick was relieved from the\\nsight of her tantalising smile.\\n\\n\"I will tell my story simply,\" said she, \"with the simple suggestion\\nthat you believe me; otherwise you will make a mistake. While I was\\nresting from a dance the other night, I heard two of the young people\\ntalking about the Zabels. One of them was laughing at the old men, and\\nthe other was trying to relate some half-forgotten story of early love\\nwhich had been the cause, she thought, of their strange and melancholy\\nlives. I was listening to them, but I did not take in much of what they\\nwere saying till I heard behind me an irascible voice exclaiming: \\'You\\nlaugh, do you? I wonder if you would laugh so easily if you knew that\\nthese two poor old men haven\\'t had a decent meal in a fortnight?\\' I\\ndidn\\'t know the speaker, but I was thrilled by his words. Not had a good\\nmeal, these men, for a fortnight! I felt as if personally guilty of\\ntheir suffering, and, happening to raise my eyes at this minute and\\nseeing through an open door the bountiful refreshments prepared for us\\nin the supper room, I felt guiltier than ever. Suddenly I took a\\nresolution. It was a queer one, and may serve to show you some of the\\noddities of my nature. Though I was engaged for the next dance, and\\nthough I was dressed in the flimsy garments suitable to the occasion, I\\ndecided to leave the ball and carry some sandwiches down to these old\\nmen. Procuring a bit of paper, I made up a bundle and stole out of the\\nhouse without having said a word to anybody of my intention. Not wishing\\nto be seen, I went out by the garden door, which is at the end of the\\ndark hall--\"\\n\\n\"Just as the band was playing the Harebell mazurka,\" interpolated\\nSweetwater.\\n\\nStartled for the first time from her careless composure by an\\ninterruption of which it was impossible for her at that time to measure\\neither the motive or the meaning, she ceased to play with her fingers on\\nthe baluster rail and let her eyes rest for a moment on the man who had\\nthus spoken, as if she hesitated between her desire to annihilate him\\nfor his impertinence and a fear of the cold hate she saw actuating his\\nevery word and look. Then she went on, as if no one had spoken:\\n\\n\"I ran down the hill recklessly. I was bent on my errand and not at all\\nafraid of the dark. When I reached that part of the road where the\\nstreets branch off, I heard footsteps in front of me. I had overtaken\\nsomeone. Slackening my pace, so that I should not pass this person, whom\\nI instinctively knew to be a man, I followed him till I came to a high\\nboard fence. It was that surrounding Agatha Webb\\'s house, and when I saw\\nit I could not help connecting the rather stealthy gait of the man in\\nfront of me with a story I had lately heard of the large sum of money\\nshe was known to keep in her house. Whether this was before or after\\nthis person disappeared round the corner I cannot say, but no sooner had\\nI become certain that he was bent upon entering this house than my\\nimpulse to follow him became greater than my precaution, and turning\\naside from the direct path to the Zabels\\', I hurried down High Street\\njust in time to see the man enter Mrs. Webb\\'s front gateway.\\n\\n\"It was a late hour for visiting, but as the house had lights in both\\nits lower and upper stories, I should by good rights have taken it for\\ngranted that he was an expected guest and gone on my way to the Zabels\\'.\\nBut I did not. The softness with which this person stepped and the\\nskulking way in which he hesitated at the front gate aroused my worst\\nfears, and after he had opened that gate and slid in, I was so pursued\\nby the idea that he was there for no good that I stepped inside the gate\\nmyself and took my stand in the deep shadow cast by the old pear tree on\\nthe right-hand side of the walk. Did anyone speak?\"\\n\\nThere was a unanimous denial from the five gentlemen before her, yet she\\ndid not look satisfied.\\n\\n\"I thought I heard someone make a remark,\" she repeated, and paused\\nagain for a half-minute, during which her smile was a study, it was so\\ncold and in such startling contrast to the vivid glances she threw\\neverywhere except behind her on the landing where Frederick stood\\nlistening to her every word.\\n\\n\"We are very much interested,\" remarked Mr. Courtney. \"Pray, go on.\"\\n\\nDrawing her left hand from the balustrade where it had rested, she\\nlooked at one of her fingers with an odd backward gesture.\\n\\n\"I will,\" she said, and her tone was hard and threatening. \"Five\\nminutes, no longer, passed, when I was startled by a loud and terrible\\ncry from the house, and looking up at the second-story window from which\\nthe sound proceeded, I saw a woman\\'s figure hanging out in a seemingly\\npulseless condition. Too terrified to move, I clung trembling to the\\ntree, hearing and not hearing the shouts and laughter of a dozen or more\\nmen, who at that minute passed by the corner on their way to the\\nwharves. I was dazed, I was choking, and only came to myself when,\\nsooner or later, I do not know how soon or how late, a fresh horror\\nhappened. The woman whom I had just seen fall almost from the window was\\na serving woman, but when I heard another scream I knew that the\\nmistress of the house was being attacked, and rivetting my eyes on those\\nwindows, I beheld the shade of one of them thrown back and a hand\\nappear, flinging out something which fell in the grass on the opposite\\nside of the lawn. Then the shade fell again, and hearing nothing\\nfurther, I ran to where the object flung out had fallen, and feeling for\\nit, found and picked up an old-fashioned dagger, dripping with blood.\\nHorrified beyond all expression, I dropped the weapon and retreated into\\nmy former place of concealment.\\n\\n\"But I was not satisfied to remain there. A curiosity, a determination\\neven, to see the man who had committed this dastardly deed, attacked me\\nwith such force that I was induced to leave my hiding-place and even to\\nenter the house where in all probability he was counting the gains he\\nhad just obtained at the price of so much precious blood. The door,\\nwhich he had not perfectly closed behind him, seemed to invite me in,\\nand before I had realised my own temerity, I was standing in the hall of\\nthis ill-fated house.\"\\n\\nThe interest, which up to this moment had been breathless, now expressed\\nitself in hurried ejaculations and broken words; and Mr. Sutherland, who\\nhad listened like one in a dream, exclaimed eagerly, and in a tone which\\nproved that he, for the moment at least, believed this more than\\nimprobable tale:\\n\\n\"Then you can tell us if Philemon was in the little room at the moment\\nwhen you entered the house?\"\\n\\nAs everyone there present realised the importance of this question, a\\ngeneral movement took place and each and all drew nearer as she met\\ntheir eyes and answered placidly:\\n\\n\"Yes; Mr. Webb was sitting in a chair asleep. He was the only person I\\nsaw.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I know he never committed this crime,\" gasped his old friend, in a\\nrelief so great that one and all seemed to share it.\\n\\n\"Now I have courage for the rest. Go on, Miss Page.\"\\n\\nBut Miss Page paused again to look at her finger, and give that sideways\\ntoss to her head that seemed so uncalled for by the situation to any who\\ndid not know of the compact between herself and the listening man below.\\n\\n\"I hate to go back to that moment,\" said she; \"for when I saw the\\ncandles burning on the table, and the husband of the woman who at that\\nvery instant was possibly breathing her last breath in the room\\noverhead, sitting there in unconscious apathy, I felt something rise in\\nmy throat that made me deathly sick for a moment. Then I went right in\\nwhere he was, and was about to shake his arm and wake him, when I\\ndetected a spot of blood on my finger from the dagger I had handled.\\nThat gave me another turn, and led me to wipe off my finger on his\\nsleeve.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity you did not wipe off your slippers too,\" murmured\\nSweetwater.\\n\\nAgain she looked at him, again her eyes opened in terror upon the face\\nof this man, once so plain and insignificant in her eyes, but now so\\nfilled with menace she inwardly quaked before it, for all her apparent\\nscorn.\\n\\n\"Slippers,\" she murmured.\\n\\n\"Did not your feet as well as your hands pass through the blood on the\\ngrass?\"\\n\\nShe disdained to answer him.\\n\\n\"I have accounted for the blood on my hand,\" she said, not looking at\\nhim, but at Mr. Courtney. \"If there is any on my slippers it can be\\naccounted for in the same way.\" And she rapidly resumed her narrative.\\n\"I had no sooner made my little finger clean I never thought of anyone\\nsuspecting the old gentleman when I heard steps on the stairs and knew\\nthat the murderer was coming down, and in another instant would pass the\\nopen door before which I stood.\\n\\n\"Though I had been courageous enough up to that minute, I was seized by\\na sudden panic at the prospect of meeting face to face one whose hands\\nwere perhaps dripping with the blood of his victim. To confront him\\nthere and then might mean death to me, and I did not want to die, but to\\nlive, for I am young, sirs, and not without a prospect of happiness\\nbefore me. So I sprang back, and seeing no other place of concealment in\\nthe whole bare room, crouched down in the shadow of the man you call\\nPhilemon. For one, two minutes, I knelt there in a state of mortal\\nterror, while the feet descended, paused, started to enter the room\\nwhere I was, hesitated, turned, and finally left the house.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Page, wait, wait,\" put in the coroner. \"You saw him; you can tell\\nwho this man was?\"\\n\\nThe eagerness of this appeal seemed to excite her. A slight colour\\nappeared in her cheeks and she took a step forward, but before the words\\nfor which they so anxiously waited could leave her lips, she gave a\\nstart and drew back with, an ejaculation which left a more or less\\nsinister echo in the ears of all who heard it.\\n\\nFrederick had just shown himself at the top of the staircase.\\n\\n\"Good-morning, gentlemen,\" said he, advancing into their midst with an\\nair whose unexpected manliness disguised his inward agitation. \"The few\\nwords I have just heard Miss Page say interest me so much, I find it\\nimpossible not to join you.\"\\n\\nAmabel, upon whose lips a faint complacent smile had appeared as he\\nstepped by her, glanced up at these words in secret astonishment at the\\nindifference they showed, and then dropped her eyes to his hands with an\\nintent gaze which seemed to affect him unpleasantly, for he thrust them\\nimmediately behind him, though he did not lower his head or lose his air\\nof determination.\\n\\n\"Is my presence here undesirable?\" he inquired, with a glance towards\\nhis father.\\n\\nSweetwater looked as if he thought it was, but he did not presume to say\\nanything, and the others being too interested in the developments of\\nMiss Page\\'s story to waste any time on lesser matters, Frederick\\nremained, greatly to Miss Page\\'s evident satisfaction.\\n\\n\"Did you see this man\\'s face?\" Mr. Courtney now broke in, in urgent\\ninquiry.\\n\\nHer answer came slowly, after another long look in Frederick\\'s\\ndirection.\\n\\n\"No, I did not dare to make the effort. I was obliged to crouch too\\nclose to the floor. I simply heard his footsteps.\"\\n\\n\"See, now!\" muttered Sweetwater, but in so low a tone she did not hear\\nhim. \"She condemns herself. There isn\\'t a woman living who would fail to\\nlook up under such circumstances, even at the risk of her life.\"\\n\\nKnapp seemed to agree with him, but Mr. Courtney, following his one\\nidea, pressed his former question, saying:\\n\\n\"Was it an old man\\'s step?\"\\n\\n\"It was not an agile one.\"\\n\\n\"And you did not catch the least glimpse of the man\\'s face or figure?\"\\n\\n\"Not a glimpse.\"\\n\\n\"So you are in no position to identify him?\"\\n\\n\"If by any chance I should hear those same footsteps coming down a\\nflight of stairs, I think I should be able to recognise them,\" she\\nallowed, in the sweetest tones at her command.\\n\\n\"She knows it is too late for her to hear those of the two dead Zabels,\"\\ngrowled the man from Boston.\\n\\n\"We are no nearer the solution of this mystery than we were in the\\nbeginning,\" remarked the coroner.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen, I have not yet finished my story,\" intimated Amabel,\\nsweetly. \"Perhaps what I have yet to tell may give you some clew to the\\nidentity of this man.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes; go on, go on. You have not yet explained how you came to be in\\npossession of Agatha\\'s money.\"\\n\\n\"Just so,\" she answered, with another quick look at Frederick, the last\\nshe gave him for some time. \"As soon, then, as I dared, I ran out of the\\nhouse into the yard. The moon, which had been under a cloud, was now\\nshining brightly, and by its light I saw that the space before me was\\nempty and that I might venture to enter the street. But before doing so\\nI looked about for the dagger I had thrown from me before going in, but\\nI could not find it. It had been picked up by the fugitive and carried\\naway. Annoyed at the cowardice which had led me to lose such a valuable\\npiece of evidence through a purely womanish emotion, I was about to\\nleave the yard, when my eyes fell on the little bundle of sandwiches\\nwhich I had brought down from the hill and which I had let fall under\\nthe pear tree, at the first scream I had heard from the house. It had\\nburst open and two or three of the sandwiches lay broken on the ground.\\nBut those that were intact I picked up, and being more than ever anxious\\nto cover up by some ostensible errand my absence from the party, I\\nrushed away toward the lonely road where these brothers lived, meaning\\nto leave such fragments as remained on the old doorstep, beyond which I\\nhad been told such suffering existed.\\n\\n\"It was now late, very late, for a girl like myself to be out, but,\\nunder the excitement of what I had just seen and heard, I became\\noblivious to fear, and rushed into those dismal shadows as into\\ntransparent daylight. Perhaps the shouts and stray sounds of laughter\\nthat came up from the wharves where a ship was getting under way gave me\\na certain sense of companionship. Perhaps--but it is folly for me to\\ndilate upon my feelings; it is my errand you are interested in, and what\\nhappened when I approached the Zabels\\' dreary dwelling.\"\\n\\nThe look with which she paused, ostensibly to take breath, but in\\nreality to weigh and criticise the looks of those about her, was one of\\nthose wholly indescribable ones with which she was accustomed to control\\nthe judgment of men who allowed themselves to watch too closely the\\never-changing expression of her weird yet charming face. But it fell\\nupon men steeled against her fascinations, and realising her inability\\nto move them, she proceeded with her story before even the most anxious\\nof her hearers could request her to do so.\\n\\n\"I had come along the road very quietly,\" said she, \"for my feet were\\nlightly shod, and the moonlight was too bright for me to make a misstep.\\nBut as I cleared the trees and came into the open place where the house\\nstands I stumbled with surprise at seeing a figure crouching on the\\ndoorstep I had anticipated finding as empty as the road. It was an old\\nman\\'s figure, and as I paused in my embarrassment he slowly and with\\ngreat feebleness rose to his feet and began to grope about for the door.\\nAs he did so, I heard a sharp tinkling sound, as of something metallic\\nfalling on the doorstone, and, taking a quick step forward, I looked\\nover his shoulder and espied in the moonlight at his feet a dagger so\\nlike the one I had lately handled in Mrs. Webb\\'s yard that I was\\noverwhelmed with astonishment, and surveyed the aged and feeble form of\\nthe man who had dropped it with a sensation difficult to describe. The\\nnext moment he was stooping for the weapon, with a startled air that has\\nimpressed itself distinctly upon my memory, and when, after many feeble\\nattempts, he succeeded in grasping it, he vanished into the house so\\nsuddenly that I could not be sure whether or not he had seen me standing\\nthere.\\n\\n\"All this was more than surprising to me, for I had never thought of\\nassociating an old man with this crime. Indeed, I was so astonished to\\nfind him in possession of this weapon that I forgot all about my errand\\nand only wondered how I could see and know more. Fearing detection, I\\nslid in amongst the bushes and soon found myself under one of the\\nwindows. The shade was down and I was about to push it aside when I\\nheard someone moving about inside and stopped. But I could not restrain\\nmy curiosity, so pulling a hairpin from my hair, I worked a little hole\\nin the shade and through this I looked into a room brightly illumined by\\nthe moon which shone in through an adjoining window. And what did I see\\nthere?\" Her eye turned on Frederick. His right hand had stolen toward\\nhis left, but it paused under her look and remained motionless. \"Only an\\nold man sitting at a table and--\" Why did she pause, and why did she\\ncover up that pause with a wholly inconsequential sentence? Perhaps\\nFrederick could have told, Frederick, whose hand had now fallen at his\\nside. But Frederick volunteered nothing, and no one, not even\\nSweetwater, guessed all that lay beyond that AND which was left hovering\\nin the air to be finished--- when? Alas! had she not set the day and the\\nhour?\\n\\nWhat she did say was in seeming explanation of her previous sentence.\\n\"It was not the same old man I had seen on the doorstep, and while I was\\nlooking at him I became aware of someone leaving the house and passing\\nme on the road up-hill. Of course this ended my interest in what went on\\nwithin, and turning as quickly as I could I hurried into the road and\\nfollowed the shadow I could just perceive disappearing in the woods\\nabove me. I was bound, gentlemen, as you see, to follow out my adventure\\nto the end. But my task now became very difficult, for the moon was high\\nand shone down upon the road so distinctly that I could not follow the\\nperson before me as closely as I wished without running the risk of\\nbeing discovered by him. I therefore trusted more to my ear than to my\\neye, and as long as I could hear his steps in front of me I was\\nsatisfied. But presently, as we turned up this very hill, I ceased to\\nhear these steps and so became confident that he had taken to the woods.\\nI was so sure of this that I did not hesitate to enter them myself, and,\\nknowing the paths well, as I have every opportunity of doing, living, as\\nwe do, directly opposite this forest, I easily found my way to the\\nlittle clearing that I have reason to think you gentlemen have since\\nbecome acquainted with. But though from the sounds I heard I was assured\\nthat the person I was following was not far in advance of me, I did not\\ndare to enter this brilliantly illumined space, especially as there was\\nevery indication of this person having completed whatever task he had\\nset for himself. Indeed, I was sure that I heard his steps coming back.\\nSo, for the second time, I crouched down in the darkest place I could\\nfind and let this mysterious person pass me. When he had quite\\ndisappeared, I made my own retreat, for it was late, and I was afraid of\\nbeing missed at the ball. But later, or rather the next day, I recrossed\\nthe road and began a search for the money which I was confident had been\\nleft in the woods opposite, by the person I had been following. I found\\nit, and when the man here present who, though a mere fiddler, has\\npresumed to take a leading part in this interview, came upon me with the\\nbills in my hand, I was but burying deeper the ill-gotten gains I had\\ncome upon.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, and so making them your own,\" quoth Sweetwater, stung by the\\nsarcasm in that word fiddler.\\n\\nBut with a suavity against which every attack fell powerless, she met\\nhis significant look with one fully as significant, and quietly said:\\n\\n\"If I had wanted the money for myself I would not have risked leaving it\\nwhere the murderer could find it by digging up a few handfuls of mould\\nand a bunch of sodden leaves. No, I had another motive for my action, a\\nmotive with which few, if any, of you will be willing to credit me. I\\nwished to save the murderer, whom I had some reason, as you see, for\\nthinking I knew, from the consequences of his own action.\"\\n\\nMr. Courtney, Dr. Talbot, and even Mr. Sutherland, who naturally\\nbelieved she referred to Zabel, and who, one and all, had a lingering\\ntenderness for this unfortunate old man, which not even this seeming act\\nof madness on his part could quite destroy, felt a species of reaction\\nat this, and surveyed the singular being before them with, perhaps, the\\nslightest shade of relenting in their severity. Sweetwater alone\\nbetrayed restlessness, Knapp showed no feeling at all, while Frederick\\nstood like one petrified, and moved neither hand nor foot.\\n\\n\"Crime is despicable when it results from cupidity only,\" she went on,\\nwith a deliberateness so hard that the more susceptible of her auditors\\nshuddered. \"But crime that springs from some imperative and overpowering\\nnecessity of the mind or body might well awaken sympathy, and I am not\\nashamed of having been sorry for this frenzied and suffering man. Weak\\nand impulsive as you may consider me, I did not want him to suffer on\\naccount of a moment\\'s madness, as he undoubtedly would if he were ever\\nfound with Agatha Webb\\'s money in his possession, so I plunged it deeper\\ninto the soil and trusted to the confusion which crime always awakens\\neven in the strongest mind, for him not to discover its hiding-place\\ntill the danger connected with it was over.\"\\n\\n\"Ha! wonderful! Devilish subtle, eh? Clever, too clever!\" were some of\\nthe whispered exclamations which this curious explanation on her part\\nbrought out. Yet only Sweetwater showed his open and entire disbelief of\\nthe story, the others possibly remembering that for such natures as hers\\nthere is no governing law and no commonplace interpretation.\\n\\nTo Sweetwater, however, this was but so much display of feminine\\nresource and subtlety. Though he felt he should keep still in the\\npresence of men so greatly his superiors, he could not resist saying:\\n\\n\"Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. I should never have\\nattributed any such motive as you mention to the young girl I saw\\nleaving this spot with many a backward glance at the hole from which we\\nafterwards extracted the large sum of money in question. But say that\\nthis reburying of stolen funds was out of consideration for the feeble\\nold man you describe as having carried them there, do you not see that\\nby this act you can be held as an accessory after the fact?\"\\n\\nHer eyebrows went up and the delicate curve of her lips was not without\\nmenace as she said:\\n\\n\"You hate me, Mr. Sweetwater. Do you wish me to tell these gentlemen\\nwhy?\"\\n\\nThe flush which, notwithstanding this peculiar young man\\'s nerve,\\ninstantly crimsoned his features, was a surprise to Frederick. So was it\\nto the others, who saw in it a possible hint as to the real cause of his\\npersistent pursuit of this young girl, which they had hitherto ascribed\\nentirely to his love of justice. Slighted love makes some hearts\\nvenomous. Could this ungainly fellow have once loved and been disdained\\nby this bewitching piece of unreliability?\\n\\nIt was a very possible assumption, though Sweetwater\\'s blush was the\\nonly answer he gave to her question, which nevertheless had amply served\\nits turn.\\n\\nTo fill the gap caused by his silence, Mr. Sutherland made an effort and\\naddressed her himself.\\n\\n\"Your conduct,\" said he, \"has not been that of a strictly honourable\\nperson. Why did you fail to give the alarm when you re-entered my house\\nafter being witness to this double tragedy?\"\\n\\nHer serenity was not to be disturbed.\\n\\n\"I have just explained,\" she reminded him, \"that I had sympathy for the\\ncriminal.\"\\n\\n\"We all have sympathy for James Zabel, but--\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe one word of this story,\" interposed Sweetwater, in\\nreckless disregard of proprieties. \"A hungry, feeble old man, like\\nZabel, on the verge of death, could not have found his way into these\\nwoods. You carried the money there yourself, miss; you are the--\"\\n\\n\"Hush!\" interposed the coroner, authoritatively; \"do not let us go too\\nfast--yet. Miss Page has an air of speaking the truth, strange and\\nunaccountable as it may seem. Zabel was an admirable man once, and if he\\nwas led into theft and murder, it was not until his faculties had been\\nweakened by his own suffering and that of his much-loved brother.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" was her simple reply; and for the first time every man\\nthere thrilled at her tone. Seeing it, all the dangerous fascination of\\nher look and manner returned upon her with double force. \"I have been\\nunwise,\" said she, \"and let my sympathy run away with my judgment. Women\\nhave impulses of this kind sometimes, and men blame them for it, till\\nthey themselves come to the point of feeling the need of just such blind\\ndevotion. I am sure I regret my short-sightedness now, for I have lost\\nesteem by it, while he--\" With a wave of the hand she dismissed the\\nsubject, and Dr. Talbot, watching her, felt a shade of his distrust\\nleave him, and in its place a species of admiration for the lithe,\\ngraceful, bewitching personality before them, with her childish impulses\\nand womanly wit which half mystified and half imposed upon them.\\n\\nMr. Sutherland, on the contrary, was neither charmed from his antagonism\\nnor convinced of her honesty. There was something in this matter that\\ncould not be explained away by her argument, and his suspicion of that\\nsomething he felt perfectly sure was shared by his son, toward whose\\ncold, set face he had frequently cast the most uneasy glances. He was\\nnot ready, however, to probe into the subject more deeply, nor could he,\\nfor the sake of Frederick, urge on to any further confession a young\\nwoman whom his unhappy son professed to love, and in whose discretion he\\nhad so little confidence. As for Sweetwater, he had now fully recovered\\nhis self-possession, and bore himself with great discretion when Dr.\\nTalbot finally said:\\n\\n\"Well, gentlemen, we have got more than we expected when we came here\\nthis morning. There remains, however, a point regarding which we have\\nreceived no explanation. Miss Page, how came that orchid, which I am\\ntold you wore in your hair at the dance, to be found lying near the hem\\nof Batsy\\'s skirts? You distinctly told us that you did not go up-stairs\\nwhen you were in Mrs. Webb\\'s house.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that\\'s so!\" acquiesced the Boston detective dryly. \"How came that\\nflower on the scene of the murder?\"\\n\\nShe smiled and seemed equal to the emergency.\\n\\n\"That is a mystery for us all to solve,\" she said quietly, frankly\\nmeeting the eyes of her questioner.\\n\\n\"A mystery it is your business to solve,\" corrected the district\\nattorney. \"Nothing that you have told us in support of your innocence\\nwould, in the eyes of the law, weigh for one instant against the\\ncomplicity shown by that one piece of circumstantial evidence against\\nyou.\"\\n\\nHer smile carried a certain high-handed denial of this to one heart\\nthere, at least. But her words were humble enough.\\n\\n\"I am aware of that,\" said she. Then, turning to where Sweetwater stood\\nlowering upon her from out his half-closed eyes, she impetuously\\nexclaimed: \"You, sir, who, with no excuse an honourable person can\\nrecognise, have seen fit to arrogate to yourself duties wholly out of\\nyour province, prove yourself equal to your presumption by ferreting\\nout, alone and unassisted, the secret of this mystery. It can be done,\\nfor, mark, _I_ did not carry that flower into the room where it was\\nfound. This I am ready to assert before God and before man!\"\\n\\nHer hand was raised, her whole attitude spoke defiance and--hard as it\\nwas for Sweetwater to acknowledge it--truth. He felt that he had\\nreceived a challenge, and with a quick glance at Knapp, who barely\\nresponded by a shrug, he shifted over to the side of Dr. Talbot.\\n\\nAmabel at once dropped her hand.\\n\\n\"May I go?\" she now cried appealingly to Mr. Courtney. \"I really have no\\nmore to say, and I am tired.\"\\n\\n\"Did you see the figure of the man who brushed by you in the wood? Was\\nit that of the old man you saw on the doorstep?\"\\n\\nAt this direct question Frederick quivered in spite of his dogged\\nself-control. But she, with her face upturned to meet the scrutiny of\\nthe speaker, showed only a childish kind of wonder. \"Why do you ask\\nthat? Is there any doubt about its being the same?\"\\n\\nWhat an actress she was! Frederick stood appalled. He had been amazed at\\nthe skill with which she had manipulated her story so as to keep her\\npromise to him, and yet leave the way open for that further confession\\nwhich would alter the whole into a denunciation of himself which he\\nwould find it difficult, if not impossible, to meet. But this extreme\\ndissimulation made him lose heart. It showed her to be an antagonist of\\nalmost illimitable resource and secret determination.\\n\\n\"I did not suppose there could be any doubt,\" she added, in such a\\nnatural tone of surprise that Mr. Courtney dropped the subject, and Dr.\\nTalbot turned to Sweetwater, who for the moment seemed to have robbed\\nKnapp of his rightful place as the coroner\\'s confidant.\\n\\n\"Shall we let her go for the present?\" he whispered. \"She does look\\ntired, poor girl.\"\\n\\nThe public challenge which Sweetwater had received made him wary, and\\nhis reply was a guarded one:\\n\\n\"I do not trust her, yet there is much to confirm her story. Those\\nsandwiches, now. She says she dropped them in Mrs. Webb\\'s yard under the\\npear tree, and that the bag that held them burst open. Gentlemen, the\\nbirds were so busy there on the morning after the murder that I could\\nnot but notice them, notwithstanding my absorption in greater matters. I\\nremember wondering what they were all pecking at so eagerly. But how\\nabout the flower whose presence on the scene of guilt she challenges me\\nto explain? And the money so deftly reburied by her? Can any explanation\\nmake her other than accessory to a crime on whose fruits she lays her\\nhand in a way tending solely to concealment? No, sirs; and so I shall\\nnot relax my vigilance over her, even if, in order to be faithful to it,\\nI have to suggest that a warrant be made out for her imprisonment.\"\\n\\n\"You are right,\" acquiesced the coroner, and turning to Miss Page, he\\ntold her she was too valuable a witness to be lost sight of, and\\nrequested her to prepare to accompany him into town.\\n\\nShe made no objection. On the contrary her cheeks dimpled, and she\\nturned away with alacrity towards her room. But before the door closed\\non her she looked back, and, with a persuasive smile, remarked that she\\nhad told all she knew, or thought she knew at the time. But that\\nperhaps, after thinking the matter carefully over, she might remember\\nsome detail that would throw some extra light on the subject.\\n\\n\"Call her back!\" cried Mr. Courtney. \"She is withholding something. Let\\nus hear it all.\"\\n\\nBut Mr. Sutherland, with a side look at Frederick, persuaded the\\ndistrict attorney to postpone all further examination of this artful\\ngirl until they were alone. The anxious father had noted, what the rest\\nwere too preoccupied to observe, that Frederick had reached the limit of\\nhis strength and could not be trusted to preserve his composure any\\nlonger in face of this searching examination into the conduct of a woman\\nfrom whom he had so lately detached himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIX\\n\\nPOOR PHILEMON\\n\\n\\nThe next day was the day of Agatha\\'s funeral. She was to be buried in\\nPortchester, by the side of her six children, and, as the day was fine,\\nthe whole town, as by common consent, assembled in the road along which\\nthe humble cortege was to make its way to the spot indicated.\\n\\nFrom the windows of farmhouses, from between the trees of the few\\nscattered thickets along the way, saddened and curious faces looked\\nforth till Sweetwater, who walked as near as he dared to the immediate\\nfriends of the deceased, felt the impossibility of remembering them all\\nand gave up the task in despair.\\n\\nBefore one house, about a mile out of town, the procession paused, and\\nat a gesture from the minister everyone within sight took off their\\nhats, amid a hush which made almost painfully apparent the twittering of\\nbirds and the other sounds of animate and inanimate nature, which are\\ninseparable from a country road. They had reached widow Jones\\'s cottage\\nin which Philemon was then staying.\\n\\nThe front door was closed, and so were the lower windows, but in one of\\nthe upper casements a movement was perceptible, and in another instant\\nthere came into view a woman and man, supporting between them the\\nimpassive form of Agatha\\'s husband. Holding him up in plain sight of the\\nalmost breathless throng below, the woman pointed to where his darling\\nlay and appeared to say something to him.\\n\\nThen there was to be seen a strange sight. The old man, with his thin\\nwhite locks fluttering in the breeze, leaned forward with a smile, and\\nholding out his arms, cried in a faint but joyful tone: \"Agatha!\" Then,\\nas if realising for the first time that it was death he looked upon, and\\nthat the crowd below was a funeral procession, his face altered and he\\nfell back with a low heartbroken moan into the arms of those who\\nsupported him.\\n\\nAs his white head disappeared from sight, the procession moved on, and\\nfrom only one pair of lips went up that groan of sorrow with which every\\nheart seemed surcharged. One groan. From whose lips did it come?\\nSweetwater endeavoured to ascertain, but was not able, nor could anyone\\ninform him, unless it was Mr. Sutherland, whom he dared not approach.\\n\\nThis gentleman was on foot like the rest, with his arm fast linked in\\nthat of his son Frederick. He had meant to ride, for the distance was\\nlong for men past sixty; but finding the latter resolved to walk, he had\\nconsented to do the same rather than be separated from his son.\\n\\nHe had fears for Frederick--he could hardly have told why; and as the\\nceremony proceeded and Agatha was solemnly laid away in the place\\nprepared for her, his sympathies grew upon him to such an extent that he\\nfound it difficult to quit the young man for a moment, or even to turn\\nhis eyes away from the face he had never seemed to know till now. But as\\nfriends and strangers were now leaving the yard, he controlled himself,\\nand assuming a more natural demeanour, asked his son if he were now\\nready to ride back. But, to his astonishment, Frederick replied that he\\ndid not intend to return to Sutherlandtown at present; that he had\\nbusiness in Portchester, and that he was doubtful as to when he would be\\nready to return. As the old gentleman did not wish to raise a\\ncontroversy, he said nothing, but as soon as he saw Frederick disappear\\nup the road, he sent back the carriage he had ordered, saying that he\\nwould return in a Portchester gig as soon as he had settled some affairs\\nof his own, which might and might not detain him there till evening.\\n\\nThen he proceeded to a little inn, where he hired a room with windows\\nthat looked out on the high-road. In one of these windows he sat all\\nday, watching for Frederick, who had gone farther up the road.\\n\\nBut no Frederick appeared, and with vague misgivings, for which as yet\\nhe had no name, he left the window and set out on foot for home.\\n\\nIt was now dark, but a silvery gleam on the horizon gave promise of the\\nspeedy rising of a full moon. Otherwise he would not have attempted to\\nwalk over a road proverbially dark and dismal.\\n\\nThe churchyard in which they had just laid away Agatha lay in his\\ncourse. As he approached it he felt his heart fail, and stopping a\\nmoment at the stone wall that separated it from the high-road, he leaned\\nagainst the trunk of a huge elm that guarded the gate of entrance. As he\\ndid so he heard a sound of repressed sobbing from some spot not very far\\naway, and, moved by some undefinable impulse stronger than his will, he\\npushed open the gate and entered the sacred precincts.\\n\\nInstantly the weirdness and desolation of the spot struck him. He\\nwished, yet dreaded, to advance. Something in the grief of the mourner\\nwhose sobs he had heard had seized upon his heart-strings, and yet, as\\nhe hesitated, the sounds came again, and forgetting that his intrusion\\nmight not prove altogether welcome, he pressed forward, till he came\\nwithin a few feet of the spot from which the sobs issued.\\n\\nHe had moved quietly, feeling the awesomeness of the place, and when he\\npaused it was with a sensation of dread, not to be entirely explained by\\nthe sad and dismal surroundings. Dark as it was, he discerned the\\noutline of a form lying stretched in speechless misery across a grave;\\nbut when, impelled by an almost irresistible compassion, he strove to\\nspeak, his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth and he only drew back\\nfarther into the shadow.\\n\\nHe had recognised the mourner and the grave. The mourner was Frederick\\nand the grave that of Agatha Webb.\\n\\nA few minutes later Mr. Sutherland reappeared at the door of the inn,\\nand asked for a gig and driver to take him back to Sutherlandtown. He\\nsaid, in excuse for his indecision, that he had undertaken to walk, but\\nhad found his strength inadequate to the exertion. He was looking very\\npale, and trembled so that the landlord, who took his order, asked him\\nif he were ill. But Mr. Sutherland insisted that he was quite well, only\\nin a hurry, and showed the greatest impatience till he was again started\\nupon the road.\\n\\nFor the first half-mile he sat perfectly silent. The moon was now up,\\nand the road stretched before them, flooded with light. As long as no\\none was to be seen on this road, or on the path running beside it, Mr.\\nSutherland held himself erect, his eyes fixed before him, in an attitude\\nof anxious inquiry. But as soon as any sound came to break the silence,\\nor there appeared in the distance ahead of them the least appearance of\\na plodding wayfarer, he drew back, and hid himself in the recesses of\\nthe vehicle. This happened several times. Then his whole manner changed.\\nThey had just passed Frederick, walking, with bowed head, toward\\nSutherlandtown.\\n\\nBut he was not the only person on the road at this time. A few minutes\\npreviously they had passed another man walking in the same direction. As\\nMr. Sutherland mused over this he found himself peering through the\\nsmall window at the back of the buggy, striving to catch another glimpse\\nof the two men plodding behind him. He could see them both, his son\\'s\\nform throwing its long shadow over the moonlit road, followed only too\\nclosely by the man whose ungainly shape he feared to acknowledge to\\nhimself was growing only too familiar in his eyes.\\n\\nFalling into a troubled reverie, he beheld the well-known houses, and\\nthe great trees under whose shadow he had grown from youth to manhood,\\nflit by him like phantoms in a dream. But suddenly one house and one\\nplace drew his attention with a force that startled him again into an\\nerect attitude, and seizing with one hand the arm of the driver, he\\npointed with the other at the door of the cottage they were passing,\\nsaying in choked tones:\\n\\n\"See! see! Something dreadful has happened since we passed by here this\\nmorning. That is crape, Samuel, crape, hanging from the doorpost\\nyonder!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it is crape,\" answered the driver, jumping out and running up the\\npath to look. \"Philemon must be dead; the good Philemon.\"\\n\\nHere was a fresh blow. Mr. Sutherland bowed before it for a moment, then\\nhe rose hurriedly and stepped down into the road beside the driver.\\n\\n\"Get in again,\" said he, \"and drive on. Ride a half-mile, then come back\\nfor me. I must see the widow Jones.\"\\n\\nThe driver, awed both by the occasion and the feeling it had called up\\nin Mr. Sutherland, did as he was bid and drove away. Mr. Sutherland,\\nwith a glance back at the road he had just traversed, walked painfully\\nup the path to Mrs. Jones\\'s door.\\n\\nA moment\\'s conversation with the woman who answered his summons proved\\nthe driver\\'s supposition to be correct. Philemon had passed away. He had\\nnever rallied from the shock he had received. He had joined his beloved\\nAgatha on the day of her burial, and the long tragedy of their mutual\\nlife was over.\\n\\n\"It is a mercy that no inheritor of their misfortune remains,\" quoth the\\ngood woman, as she saw the affliction her tidings caused in this\\nmuch-revered friend.\\n\\nThe assent Mr. Sutherland gave was mechanical. He was anxiously studying\\nthe road leading toward Portchester.\\n\\nSuddenly he stepped hastily into the house.\\n\\n\"Will you be so good as to let me sit down in your parlour for a few\\nminutes?\" he asked. \"I should like to rest there for an instant alone.\\nThis final blow has upset me.\"\\n\\nThe good woman bowed. Mr. Sutherland\\'s word was law in that town. She\\ndid not even dare to protest against the ALONE which he had so pointedly\\nemphasised, but left him after making him, as she said, comfortable, and\\nwent back to her duties in the room above.\\n\\nIt was fortunate she was so amenable to his wishes, for no sooner had\\nher steps ceased to be heard than Mr. Sutherland rose from the\\neasy-chair in which he had been seated, and, putting out the lamp widow\\nJones had insisted on lighting, passed directly to the window, through\\nwhich he began to peer with looks of the deepest anxiety.\\n\\nA man was coming up the road, a young man, Frederick. As Mr. Sutherland\\nrecognised him he leaned forward with increased anxiety, till at the\\nappearance of his son in front his scrutiny grew so strained and\\npenetrating that it seemed to exercise a magnetic influence upon\\nFrederick, causing him to look up.\\n\\nThe glance he gave the house was but momentary, but in that glance the\\nfather saw all that he had secretly dreaded. As his son\\'s eye fell on\\nthat fluttering bit of crape, testifying to another death in this\\nalready much-bereaved community, he staggered wildly, then in a pause of\\ndoubt drew nearer and nearer till his fingers grasped this symbol of\\nmourning and clung there. Next moment he was far down the road, plunging\\ntoward home in a state of great mental disorder.\\n\\nA half-hour afterwards Mr. Sutherland reached home. He had not overtaken\\nFrederick again, or even his accompanying shadow. Ascertaining at his\\nown door that his son had not yet come in, but had been seen going\\nfarther up the hill, he turned back again into the road and proceeded\\nafter him on foot.\\n\\nThe next place to his own was occupied by Mr. Halliday. As he approached\\nit he caught sight of a man standing half in and half out of the\\nhoneysuckle porch, whom he at first thought to be Frederick. But he soon\\nsaw that it was the fellow who had been following his son all the way\\nfrom Portchester, and, controlling his first movement of dislike, he\\nstepped up to him and quietly said:\\n\\n\"Sweetwater, is this you?\"\\n\\nThe young man fell back and showed a most extraordinary agitation,\\nquickly suppressed, however. \"Yes, sir, it is no one else. Do you know\\nwhat I am doing here?\"\\n\\n\"I fear I do. You have been to Portchester. You have seen my son--\"\\n\\nSweetwater made a hurried, almost an entreating, gesture.\\n\\n\"Never mind that, Mr. Sutherland. I had rather you wouldn\\'t say anything\\nabout that. I am as much broken up by what I have seen as you are. I\\nnever suspected him of having any direct connection with this murder;\\nonly the girl to whom he has so unfortunately attached himself. But\\nafter what I have seen, what am I to think? what am I to do? I honour\\nyou; I would not grieve you; but--but--oh, sir, perhaps you can help me\\nout of the maze into which I have stumbled. Perhaps you can assure me\\nthat Mr. Frederick did not leave the ball at the time she did. I missed\\nhim from among the dancers. I did not see him between twelve and three,\\nbut perhaps you did; and--and--\"\\n\\nHis voice broke. He was almost as profoundly agitated as Mr. Sutherland.\\nAs for the latter, who found himself unable to reassure the other on\\nthis very vital point, having no remembrance himself of having seen\\nFrederick among his guests during those fatal hours, he stood\\nspeechless, lost in abysses, the depth and horror of which only a father\\ncan appreciate. Sweetwater respected his anguish and for a moment was\\nsilent himself. Then he burst out:\\n\\n\"I had rather never lived to see this day than be the cause of shame or\\nsuffering to you. Tell me what to do. Shall I be deaf, dumb--\"\\n\\nHere Mr. Sutherland found voice.\\n\\n\"You make too much of what you saw,\" said he. \"My boy has faults and has\\nlived anything but a satisfactory life, but he is not as bad as you\\nwould intimate. He can never have taken life. That would be incredible,\\nmonstrous, in one brought up as he has been. Besides, if he were so far\\ngone in evil as to be willing to attempt crime, he had no motive to do\\nso; Sweetwater, he had no motive. A few hundred dollars but these he\\ncould have got from me, and did, but--\"\\n\\nWhy did the wretched father stop? Did he recall the circumstances under\\nwhich Frederick had obtained these last hundreds from him? They were not\\nordinary circumstances, and Frederick had been in no ordinary strait.\\nMr. Sutherland could not but acknowledge to himself that there was\\nsomething in this whole matter which contradicted the very plea he was\\nmaking, and not being able to establish the conviction of his son\\'s\\ninnocence in his own mind, he was too honourable to try to establish it\\nin that of another. His next words betrayed the depth of his struggle:\\n\\n\"It is that girl who has ruined him, Sweetwater. He loves but doubts\\nher, as who could help doing after the story she told us day before\\nyesterday? Indeed, he has doubted her ever since that fatal night, and\\nit is this which has broken his heart, and not--not--\" Again the old\\ngentleman paused; again he recovered himself, this time with a touch of\\nhis usual dignity and self-command. \"Leave me,\" he cried. \"Nothing that\\nyou have seen has escaped me; but our interpretations of it may differ.\\nI will watch over my son from this hour, and you may trust my\\nvigilance.\"\\n\\nSweetwater bowed.\\n\\n\"You have a right to command me,\" said he. \"You may have forgotten, but\\nI have not, that I owe my life to you. Years ago--perhaps you can recall\\nit--it was at the Black Pond--I was going down for the third time and my\\nmother was screaming in terror on the bank, when you plunged in\\nand--Well, sir, such things are never forgotten, and, as I said before,\\nyou have only to command me.\" He turned to go, but suddenly came back.\\nThere were signs of mental conflict in his face and voice. \"Mr.\\nSutherland, I am not a talkative man. If I trust your vigilance you may\\ntrust my discretion. Only I must have your word that you will convey no\\nwarning to your son.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland made an indefinable gesture, and Sweetwater again\\ndisappeared, this time not to return. As for Mr. Sutherland, he remained\\nstanding before Mr. Halliday\\'s door. What had the young man meant by\\nthis emphatic repetition of his former suggestion? That he would be\\nquiet, also, and not speak of what he had seen? Why, then--But to the\\nhope thus given, this honest-hearted gentleman would yield no quarter,\\nand seeing a duty before him, a duty he dare not shirk, he brought his\\nemotions, violent as they were, into complete and absolute subjection,\\nand, opening Mr. Halliday\\'s door, entered the house. They were old\\nneighbours, and ceremony was ignored between them.\\n\\nFinding the hall empty and the parlour door open he walked immediately\\ninto the latter room. The sight that met his eyes never left his memory.\\nAgnes, his little Agnes, whom he had always loved and whom he had vainly\\nlonged to call by the endearing name of daughter, sat with her face\\ntowards him, looking up at Frederick. That young gentleman had just\\nspoken to her, or she had just received something from his hand for her\\nown was held out and her expression was one of gratitude and acceptance.\\nShe was not a beautiful girl, but she had a beautiful look, and at this\\nmoment it was exalted by a feeling the old gentleman had once longed,\\nbut now dreaded inexpressibly, to see there. What could it mean? Why did\\nshe show at this unhappy crisis, interest, devotion, passion almost, for\\none she had regarded with open scorn when it was the dearest wish of his\\nheart to see them united? It was one of the contradictions of our\\nmysterious human nature, and at this crisis and in this moment of secret\\nheart-break and miserable doubt it made the old gentleman shrink, with\\nhis first feeling of actual despair.\\n\\nThe next moment Agnes had risen and they were both facing him.\\n\\n\"Good-evening, Agnes.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland forced himself to speak lightly.\\n\\n\"Ah, Frederick, do I find you here?\" The latter question had more\\nconstraint in it.\\n\\nFrederick smiled. There was an air of relief about him, almost of\\ncheerfulness.\\n\\n\"I was just leaving,\" said he. \"I was the bearer of a message to Miss\\nHalliday.\" He had always called her Agnes before.\\n\\nMr. Sutherland, who had found his faculties confused by the expression\\nhe had surprised on the young girl\\'s face, answered with a divided\\nattention:\\n\\n\"And I have a message to give you. Wait outside on the porch for me,\\nFrederick, till I exchange a word with our little friend here.\"\\n\\nAgnes, who had thrust something she held into a box that lay beside her\\non a table, turned with a confused blush to listen.\\n\\nMr. Sutherland waited till Frederick had stepped into the hall. Then he\\ndrew Agnes to one side and remorselessly, persistently, raised her face\\ntoward him till she was forced to meet his benevolent but searching\\nregard.\\n\\n\"Do you know,\" he whispered, in what he endeavoured to make a bantering\\ntone, \"how very few days it is since that unhappy boy yonder confessed\\nhis love for a young lady whose name I cannot bring myself to utter in\\nyour presence?\"\\n\\nThe intent was kind, but the effect was unexpectedly cruel. With a droop\\nof her head and a hurried gasp which conveyed a mixture of entreaty and\\nreproach, Agnes drew back in a vague endeavour to hide her sudden\\nuneasiness. He saw his mistake, and let his hands drop.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t, my dear,\" he whispered. \"I had no idea it would hurt you to hear\\nthis. You have always seemed indifferent, hard even, toward my\\nscapegrace son. And this was right, for--for--\" What could he say, how\\nexpress one-tenth of that with which his breast was labouring! He could\\nnot, he dared not, so ended, as we have intimated, by a confused\\nstammering.\\n\\nAgnes, who had never before seen this object of her lifelong admiration\\nunder any serious emotion, felt an impulse of remorse, as if she herself\\nhad been guilty of occasioning him embarrassment. Plucking up her\\ncourage, she wistfully eyed him.\\n\\n\"Did you imagine,\" she murmured, \"that I needed any warning against\\nFrederick, who has never honoured me with his regard, as he has the\\nyoung lady you cannot mention? I\\'m afraid you don\\'t know me, Mr.\\nSutherland, notwithstanding I have sat on your knee and sometimes\\nplucked at your beard in my infantile insistence upon attention.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid I don\\'t know you,\" he answered. \"I feel that I know nobody\\nnow, not even my son.\"\\n\\nHe had hoped she would look up at this, but she did not.\\n\\n\"Will my little girl think me very curious and very impertinent if I ask\\nher what my son Frederick was saying when I came into the room?\"\\n\\nShe looked up now, and with visible candour answered him immediately and\\nto the point:\\n\\n\"Frederick is in trouble, Mr. Sutherland. He has felt the need of a\\nfriend who could appreciate this, and he has asked me to be that friend.\\nBesides, he brought me a packet of letters which he entreated me to keep\\nfor him. I took them, Mr. Sutherland, and I will keep them as he asked\\nme to do, safe from everybody\\'s inspection, even my own.\"\\n\\nOh! why had he questioned her? He did not want to know of these letters;\\nhe did not want to know that Frederick possessed anything which he was\\nafraid to retain in his own possession.\\n\\n\"My son did wrong,\" said he, \"to confide anything to your care which he\\ndid not desire to retain in his own home. I feel that I ought to see\\nthese letters, for if my son is in trouble, as you say, I, his father,\\nought to know it.\"\\n\\n\"I am not sure about that,\" she smiled. \"His trouble may be of a\\ndifferent nature than you imagine. Frederick has led a life that he\\nregrets. I think his chief source of suffering lies in the fact that it\\nis so hard for him to make others believe that he means to do\\ndifferently in the future.\"\\n\\n\"Does he mean to do differently?\"\\n\\nShe flushed. \"He says so, Mr. Sutherland. And I, for one, cannot help\\nbelieving him. Don\\'t you see that he begins to look like another man?\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland was taken aback. He had noticed this fact, and had found\\nit a hard one to understand. To ascertain what her explanation of it\\nmight be, he replied at once:\\n\\n\"There is a change in him--a very evident change. What is the occasion\\nof it? To what do you ascribe it, Agnes?\"\\n\\nHow breathlessly he waited for her answer! Had she any suspicion of the\\nawful doubts which were so deeply agitating himself that night? She did\\nnot appear to have.\\n\\n\"I hesitate,\" she faltered, \"but not from any doubt of Frederick, to\\ntell you just what I think lies at the bottom of the sudden change\\nobservable in him. Miss Page (you see, I can name her, if you cannot)\\nhas proved herself so unworthy of his regard that the shock he has\\nreceived has opened his eyes to certain failings of his own which made\\nhis weakness in her regard possible. I do not know of any other\\nexplanation. Do you?\"\\n\\nAt this direct question, breathed though it was by tender lips, and\\nlaunched in ignorance of the barb which carried it to his heart, Mr.\\nSutherland recoiled and cast an anxious look upon the door. Then with\\nforced composure he quietly said: \"If you who are so much nearer his\\nage, and, let me hope, his sympathy, do not feel sure of his real\\nfeelings, how should I, who am his father, but have never been his\\nconfidant?\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" she cried, holding out her hands, \"such a good father! Some day he\\nwill appreciate that fact as well as others. Believe it, Mr. Sutherland,\\nbelieve it.\" And then, ashamed of her glowing interest, which was a\\nlittle more pronounced than became her simple attitude of friend toward\\na man professedly in love with another woman, she faltered and cast the\\nshyest of looks upward at the face she had never seen turned toward her\\nwith anything but kindness. \"I have confidence in Frederick\\'s good\\nheart,\" she added, with something like dignity.\\n\\n\"Would God that I could share it!\" was the only answer she received.\\nBefore she could recover from the shock of these words, Mr. Sutherland\\nwas gone.\\n\\nAgnes was more or less disconcerted by this interview. There was a\\nlingering in her step that night, as she trod the little white-embowered\\nchamber sacred to her girlish dreams, which bespake an overcharged\\nheart; a heart that, before she slept, found relief in these few words\\nwhispered by her into the night air, laden with the sweetness of\\nhoneysuckles:\\n\\n\"Can it be that he is right? Did I need such a warning,--I, who have\\nhated this man, and who thought that it was my hatred which made it\\nimpossible for me to think of anything or anybody else since we parted\\nfrom each other last night? O me, if it is so!\"\\n\\nAnd from the great, wide world without, tremulous with moonlight, the\\necho seemed to come back:\\n\\n\"Woe to thee, Agnes Halliday, if this be so!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXX\\n\\nA SURPRISE FOR MR. SUTHERLAND\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile Mr. Sutherland and Frederick stood facing each other in the\\nformer\\'s library. Nothing had been said during their walk down the hill,\\nand nothing seemed likely to proceed from Frederick now, though his\\nfather waited with great and growing agitation for some explanation that\\nwould relieve the immense strain on his heart. At last he himself spoke,\\ndryly, as we all speak when the heart is fullest and we fear to reveal\\nthe depth of our emotions.\\n\\n\"What papers were those you gave into Agnes Halliday\\'s keeping? Anything\\nwhich we could not have more safely, not to say discreetly, harboured in\\nour own house?\"\\n\\nFrederick, taken aback, for he had not realised that his father had seen\\nthese papers, hesitated for a moment; then he boldly said:\\n\\n\"They were letters--old letters--which I felt to be better out of this\\nhouse than in it. I could not destroy them, so I gave them into the\\nguardianship of the most conscientious person I know. I hope you won\\'t\\ndemand to see those letters. Indeed, sir, I hope you won\\'t demand to see\\nthem. They were not written for your eye, and I would rather rest under\\nyour displeasure than have them in any way made public.\"\\n\\nFrederick showed such earnestness, rather than fear, that Mr. Sutherland\\nwas astonished.\\n\\n\"When were these letters written?\" he asked. \"Lately, or before--You say\\nthey are old; how old?\"\\n\\nFrederick\\'s breath came easier.\\n\\n\"Some of them were written years ago--most of them, in fact. It is a\\npersonal matter--every man has such. I wish I could have destroyed them.\\nYou will leave them with Agnes, sir?\"\\n\\n\"You astonish me,\" said Mr. Sutherland, relieved that he could at least\\nhope that these letters were in nowise connected with the subject of his\\nown frightful suspicions. \"A young girl, to whom you certainly were most\\nindifferent a week ago, is a curious guardian of letters you decline to\\nshow your father.\"\\n\\n\"I know it,\" was Frederick\\'s sole reply.\\n\\nSomehow the humility with which this was uttered touched Mr. Sutherland\\nand roused hopes he had supposed dead. He looked his son for the first\\ntime directly in the eye, and with a beating heart said:\\n\\n\"Your secrets, if you have such, might better be entrusted to your\\nfather. You have no better friend--\" and there he stopped with a\\nhorrified, despairing feeling of inward weakness. If Frederick had\\ncommitted a crime, anything would be better than knowing it. Turning\\npartially aside, he fingered the papers on the desk before which he was\\nstanding. A large envelope, containing some legal document, lay before\\nhim. Taking it up mechanically, he opened it. Frederick as mechanically\\nwatched him.\\n\\n\"I know,\" said the latter, \"that I have no better friend. You have been\\ntoo good, too indulgent. What is it, father? You change colour, look\\nill, what is there in that paper?\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland straightened himself; there was a great reserve of\\nstrength in this broken-down man yet. Fixing Frederick with a gaze more\\npenetrating than any he had yet bestowed upon him, he folded his hands\\nbehind him with the document held tightly between them, and remarked:\\n\\n\"When you borrowed that money from me you did it like a man who expected\\nto repay it. Why? Whence did you expect to receive the money with which\\nto repay me? Answer, Frederick; this is your hour for confession.\"\\n\\nFrederick turned so pale his father dropped his eyes in mercy.\\n\\n\"Confess?\" he repeated. \"What should I confess? My sins? They are too\\nmany. As for that money, I hoped to return it as any son might hope to\\nreimburse his father for money advanced to pay a gambler\\'s debt. I said\\nI meant to work. My first money earned shall be offered to you. I--\"\\n\\n\"Well? Well?\" His father was holding the document he had just read,\\nopened out before his eyes.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you expect THIS?\" he asked. \"Didn\\'t you know that that poor\\nwoman, that wretchedly murdered, most unhappy woman, whose death the\\nwhole town mourns, had made you her heir? That by the terms of this\\ndocument, seen by me here and now for the first time, I am made executor\\nand you the inheritor of the one hundred thousand dollars or more left\\nby Agatha Webb?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" cried Frederick, his eyes glued to the paper, his whole face and\\nform expressing something more akin to terror than surprise. \"Has she\\ndone this? Why should she? I hardly knew her.\"\\n\\n\"No, you hardly knew her. And she? She hardly knew you; if she had she\\nwould have abhorred rather than enriched you. Frederick, I had rather\\nsee you dead than stand before me the inheritor of Philemon and Agatha\\nWebb\\'s hard-earned savings.\"\\n\\n\"You are right; it would be better,\" murmured Frederick, hardly heeding\\nwhat he said. Then, as he encountered his father\\'s eye resting upon him\\nwith implacable scrutiny, he added, in weak repetition: \"Why should she\\ngive her money to me? What was I to her that she should will me her\\nfortune?\"\\n\\nThe father\\'s finger trembled to a certain line in the document, which\\nseemed to offer some explanation of this; but Frederick did not follow\\nit. He had seen that his father was expecting a reply to the question he\\nhad previously put, and he was casting about in his mind how to answer\\nit.\\n\\n\"When did you know of this will?\" Mr. Sutherland now repeated. \"For know\\nof it you did before you came to me for money.\"\\n\\nFrederick summoned up his full courage and confronted his father\\nresolutely.\\n\\n\"No,\" said he, \"I did not know of it. It is as much of a surprise to me\\nas it is to you.\"\\n\\nHe lied. Mr. Sutherland knew that he lied and Frederick knew that he\\nknew it. A shadow fell between them, which the older, with that\\nunspeakable fear upon him roused by Sweetwater\\'s whispered suspicions,\\ndared no longer attempt to lift.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes in which Frederick seemed to see his father age\\nbefore his eyes, Mr. Sutherland coldly remarked:\\n\\n\"Dr. Talbot must know of this will. It has been sent here to me from\\nBoston by a lawyer who drew it up two years ago. The coroner may not as\\nyet have heard of it. Will you accompany me to his office to-morrow? I\\nshould like to have him see that we wish to be open with him in an\\naffair of such importance.\"\\n\\n\"I will accompany you gladly,\" said Frederick, and seeing that his\\nfather neither wished nor was able to say anything further, he bowed\\nwith distant ceremony as to a stranger and quietly withdrew. But when\\nthe door had closed between them and only the memory of his father\\'s\\nchanged countenance remained to trouble him, he paused and laid his hand\\nagain on the knob, as if tempted to return. But he left without doing\\nso, only to turn again at the end of the hall and gaze wistfully back.\\nYet he went on.\\n\\nAs he opened his own door and disappeared within, he said half audibly:\\n\\n\"Easy to destroy me now, Amabel. One word and I am lost!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK II\\n\\nTHE MAN OF NO REPUTATION\\n\\n\\nXXI\\n\\nSWEETWATER REASONS\\n\\n\\nAnd what of Sweetwater, in whose thoughts and actions the interest now\\ncentres?\\n\\nWhen he left Mr. Sutherland it was with feelings such as few who knew\\nhim supposed him capable of experiencing. Unattractive as he was in\\nevery way, ungainly in figure and unprepossessing of countenance, this\\nbutt of the more favoured youth in town had a heart whose secret fires\\nwere all the warmer for being so persistently covered, and this heart\\nwas wrung with trouble and heavy with a struggle that bade fair to leave\\nhim without rest that night, if not for many nights to come. Why? One\\nword will explain. Unknown to the world at large and almost unknown to\\nhimself, his best affections were fixed upon the man whose happiness he\\nthus unexpectedly saw himself destined to destroy. He loved Mr.\\nSutherland.\\n\\nThe suspicion which he now found transferred in his own mind from the\\nyoung girl whose blood-stained slippers he had purloined during the\\nexcitement of the first alarm, to the unprincipled but only son of his\\none benefactor, had not been lightly embraced or thoughtlessly\\nexpressed. He had had time to think it out in all its bearings. During\\nthat long walk from Portchester churchyard to Mr. Halliday\\'s door, he\\nhad been turning over in his mind everything that he had heard and seen\\nin connection with this matter, till the dim vision of Frederick\\'s\\nfigure going on before him was not more apparent to his sight than was\\nthe guilt he so deplored to his inward understanding.\\n\\nHe could not help but recognise him as the active party in the crime he\\nhad hitherto charged Amabel with. With the clew offered by Frederick\\'s\\nsecret anguish at the grave of Agatha, he could read the whole story of\\nthis detestable crime as plainly as if it had been written in letters of\\nfire on the circle of the surrounding darkness. Such anguish under such\\ncircumstances on the part of such a man could mean but one\\nthing--remorse; and remorse in the breast of one so proverbially\\ncareless and corrupt, over the death of a woman who was neither relative\\nnor friend, could have but one interpretation, and that was guilt.\\n\\nNo other explanation was possible. Could one be given, or if any\\nevidence could be adduced in contradiction of this assumption, he would\\nhave dismissed his new suspicion with more heartiness even than he had\\nembraced his former one. He did not wish to believe Frederick guilty. He\\nwould have purchased an inner conviction of his innocence almost at the\\nprice of his own life, not because of any latent interest in the young\\nman himself, but because he was Charles Sutherland\\'s son, and the dear,\\nif unworthy, centre of all that noble man\\'s hopes, aims, and happiness.\\nBut he could come upon no fact capable of shaking his present belief.\\nTaking for truth Amabel\\'s account of what she had seen and done on that\\nfatal night--something which he had hesitated over the previous day, but\\nwhich he now found himself forced to accept or do violence to his own\\nsecret convictions--and adding to it such facts as had come to his own\\nknowledge in his self-imposed role of detective, he had but to test the\\nevents of that night by his present theory of Frederick\\'s guilt, to find\\nthem hang together in a way too complete for mistake.\\n\\nFor what had been his reasons for charging Amabel herself with the guilt\\nof a crime she only professed to have been a partial witness to?\\n\\nThey were many.\\n\\nFirst--The forced nature of her explanations in regard to her motive for\\nleaving a merry ball and betaking herself to the midnight road in her\\nparty dress and slippers. A woman of her well-known unsympathetic nature\\nmight use the misery of the Zabels as a pretext for slipping into town\\nat night, but never would be influenced by it as a motive.\\n\\nSecond--The equally unsatisfactory nature of the reasons she gave for\\nleaving the course she had marked out for herself and entering upon the\\npursuit of an unknown man into a house in which she had no personal\\ninterest and from which she had just seen a bloody dagger thrown out.\\nThe most callous of women would have shrunk from letting her curiosity\\ncarry her thus far.\\n\\nThird--The poverty of her plea that, after having braved so much in her\\ndesire to identify this criminal, she was so frightened at his near\\napproach as to fail to lift her head when the opportunity was given her\\nto recognise him.\\n\\nFourth--Her professed inability to account for the presence of the\\norchid from her hair being found in the room with Batsy.\\n\\nFifth--Her evident attempt to throw the onus of the crime on an old man\\nmanifestly incapable from physical causes of committing it.\\n\\nSixth--The improbability, which she herself should have recognised, of\\nthis old man, in his extremely weak condition, ignoring the\\nhiding-places offered by the woods back of his own house, for the sake\\nof one not only involving a long walk, but situated close to a\\nmuch-frequented road, and almost in view of the Sutherland mansion.\\n\\nSeventh--The transparent excuse of sympathy for the old man and her\\ndesire to save him from the consequences of his crime, which she offered\\nin extenuation of her own criminal avowal of having first found and then\\nreburied the ill-gotten gains she had come upon in her persistent\\npursuit of the flying criminal. So impulsive an act might be consistent\\nwith the blind compassion of some weak-headed but warm-hearted woman,\\nbut not with her self-interested nature, incapable of performing any\\nheroic deed save from personal motives or the most headlong passion.\\n\\nLastly--The weakness of her explanation in regard to the cause which led\\nher to peer into the Zabel cottage through a hole made in the\\nwindow-shade. Curiosity has its limits even in a woman\\'s breast, and\\nunless she hoped to see more than was indicated by her words, her action\\nwas but the precursor of a personal entrance into a room where we have\\nevery reason to believe the twenty-dollar bill was left.\\n\\nA telling record and sufficient to favour the theory of her personal\\nguilt if, after due thought, certain facts in contradiction to this\\nassumption had not offered themselves to his mind even before he thought\\nof Frederick as the unknown man she had followed down the hillside, as,\\nfor instance:\\n\\nThis crime, if committed by her, was done deliberately and with a\\npremeditation antedating her departure from the ballroom. Yet she went\\nupon this errand in slippers, white slippers at that, something which so\\ncool and calculating a woman would have avoided, however careless she\\nmight have shown herself in other regards.\\n\\nAgain, guilt awakens cunning, even in the dullest breast; but she, keen\\nbeyond most men even, and so self-poised that the most searching\\nexamination could not shake her self-control, betrayed an utter\\ncarelessness as to what she did with these slippers on her return,\\nthrusting them into a place easily accessible to the most casual search.\\nHad she been conscious of guilt and thus amenable to law, the sight of\\nblood and mud-stains on those slippers would have appalled her, and she\\nwould have made some attempt to destroy them, and not put them behind a\\npicture and forgotten them.\\n\\nAgain, would she have been so careless with a flower she knew to be\\nidentified with herself? A woman who deliberately involves herself in\\ncrime has quick eyes; she would have seen that flower fall. At all\\nevents, if she had been immediately responsible for its being on the\\nscene of crime she would, with her quick wit, have found some excuse or\\nexplanation for it, instead of defying her examiners with some such\\nwords as these: \"It is a fact for you to explain. I only know that I did\\nnot carry this flower into that room of death.\"\\n\\nAgain, had she been actuated in her attempt to fix the crime on old\\nJames Zabel by a personal consciousness of guilt and a personal dread,\\nshe would not have stopped at suggestion in her allusions to the person\\nshe watched burying the treasure in the woods. Instead of speaking of\\nhim as a shadow whose flight she had followed at a distance, she would\\nhave described his figure as that of the same old man she had seen enter\\nthe Zabel cottage a few minutes before, there being no reason for\\nindefiniteness on this point, her conscience being sufficiently elastic\\nfor any falsehood that would further her ends. And lastly, her manner,\\nunder the examination to which she had been subjected, was not that of\\none who felt herself under a personal attack. It was a strange,\\nsuggestive, hesitating manner, baffling alike to him who had more or\\nless sounded her strange nature and to those who had no previous\\nknowledge of her freaks and subtle intellectual power, and only reaching\\nits height of hateful charm and mysterious daring when Frederick\\nappeared on the scene and joined, or seemed to join, himself to the\\nnumber of her examiners.\\n\\nNow, let all suspicion of her as an active agent in this crime be\\ndropped, assume Frederick to be the culprit and she the simple accessory\\nafter the fact, and see how inconsistencies vanish, and how much more\\nnatural the whole conduct of this mysterious woman appears.\\n\\nAmabel Page left a merry dance at midnight and stole away into the\\nSutherland garden in her party dress and slippers--why? Not to fulfil an\\nerrand which anyone who knows her cold and unsympathetic nature can but\\nregard as a pretext, but because she felt it imperative to see if her\\nlover (with whose character, temptations, and necessities she was fully\\nacquainted, and in whose excited and preoccupied manner she had probably\\ndiscovered signs of a secretly growing purpose) meant indeed to elude\\nhis guests and slip away to town on the dangerous and unholy enterprise\\nsuggested by their mutual knowledge of the money to be obtained there by\\none daring enough to enter a certain house open like their own to\\nmidnight visitors.\\n\\nShe followed at such an hour and into such a place, not an unknown man\\ncasually come upon, but her lover, whom she had tracked from the garden\\nof his father\\'s house, where she had lain in wait for him. It took\\ncourage to do this, but a courage no longer beyond the limit of feminine\\ndaring, for her fate was bound up in his and she could not but feel the\\nimpulse to save him from the consequences of crime, if not from the\\ncrime itself.\\n\\nAs for the aforementioned flower, what more natural than that Frederick\\nshould have transferred it from her hair to his buttonhole during some\\nof their interviews at the ball, and that it should have fallen from its\\nplace to the floor in the midst of his possible struggle with Batsy?\\n\\nAnd with this assumption of her perfect knowledge as to who the man was\\nwho had entered Mrs. Webb\\'s house, how much easier it is to understand\\nwhy she did not lift her head when she heard him descend the stairs! No\\nwoman, even one so depraved as she, would wish to see the handsome face\\nof her lover in the glare of a freshly committed crime, and besides she\\nmight very easily be afraid of him, for a man has but a blow for the\\nsuddenly detected witness of his crime unless that witness is his\\nconfidant, which from every indication Sweetwater felt bound to believe\\nAmabel was not.\\n\\nHer flight to the Zabel cottage, after an experience which would madden\\nmost women, can now be understood. She was still following her lover.\\nThe plan of making Agatha\\'s old and wretched friend amenable for her\\ndeath originated with Frederick and not with Amabel. It was he who first\\nstarted for the Zabel cottage. It was he who left the bank bill there.\\nThis is all clear, and even the one contradictory fact of the dagger\\nhaving been seen in the old man\\'s hand was not a stumbling-block to\\nSweetwater. With the audacity of one confident of his own insight, he\\nexplained it to himself thus: The dagger thrown from the window by the\\nassassin, possibly because he knew of Zabel\\'s expected visit there that\\nnight, fell on the grass and was picked up by Amabel, only to be flung\\ndown again in the brightest part of the lawn. It was lying there then,\\nwhen, a few minutes later and before either Frederick or Amabel had left\\nthe house, the old man entered the yard in a state of misery bordering\\non frenzy. He and his brother were starving, had been starving for days.\\nHe was too proud to own his want, and too loyal to his brother to leave\\nhim for the sake of the food prepared for them both at Agatha\\'s house,\\nand this was why he had hesitated over his duty till this late hour,\\nwhen his own secret misery or, perhaps, the hope of relieving his\\nbrother drove him to enter the gate he had been accustomed to see open\\nbefore him in glad hospitality. He finds the lights burning in the house\\nabove and below, and encouraged by the welcome they seem to hold out, he\\nstaggers up the path, ignorant of the tragedy which was at that very\\nmoment being enacted behind those lighted windows. But half-way toward\\nthe house he stops, the courage which has brought him so far suddenly\\nfails, and in one of those quick visions which sometimes visit men in\\nextremity, he foresees the astonishment which his emaciated figure is\\nlikely to cause in these two old friends, and burying his face in his\\nhands he stops and bitterly communes with himself before venturing\\nfarther. Fatal stop! fatal communing! for as he stands there he sees a\\ndagger, his own old dagger, how lost or how found he probably did not\\nstop to ask, lying on the grass and offering in its dumb way suggestions\\nas to how he might end this struggle without any further suffering.\\nDizzy with the new hope, preferring death to the humiliation he saw\\nbefore him in Agatha\\'s cottage, he dashes out of the yard, almost\\nupsetting Mr. Crane, who was passing by on his homeward way from an\\nerrand of mercy. A little while later Amabel comes upon him lying across\\nhis own doorstep. He has made an effort to enter, but his long walk and\\nthe excitement of this last bitter hour have been too much for him. As\\nshe watches him he gains strength and struggles to his feet, while she,\\naghast at the sight of the dagger she had herself flung down in Agatha\\'s\\nyard, and dreading the encounter between this old man and the lover she\\nhad been following to this place, creeps around the house and looks into\\nthe first window she finds open. What does she expect to see? Frederick\\nbrought face to face with this desperate figure with its uplifted knife.\\nBut instead of that she beholds another old man seated at a table\\nand--Amabel had paused when she reached that AND--and Sweetwater had not\\nthen seen how important this pause was, but now he understood it. Now he\\nsaw that if she had not had a subtle purpose in view, that if she had\\nwished to tell the truth rather than produce false inferences in the\\nminds of those about her calculated to save the criminal as she called\\nhim, she would have completed her sentence thus: \"I saw an old man\\nseated at a table and Frederick Sutherland standing over him.\" For\\nSweetwater had no longer a doubt that Frederick was in that room at that\\nmoment. What further she saw, whether she was witness to an encounter\\nbetween this intruder and James, or whether by some lingering on the\\nlatter\\'s part Frederick was able to leave the house without running\\nacross him, was a matter of comparative unimportance. What is of\\nimportance is that he did leave it and that Amabel, knowing it was\\nFrederick, strove to make her auditors believe it was Zabel, who carried\\nthe remainder of the money into the woods. Yet she did not say so, and\\nif her words on this subject could be carefully recalled, one would see\\nthat it was still her lover she was following and no old man, tottering\\non the verge of the grave and only surviving because of the task he was\\nbent on performing.\\n\\nAmabel\\'s excuse for handling the treasure, and for her reburial of the\\nsame, comes now within the bounds of possibility. She hoped to share\\nthis money some day, and her greed was too great for her to let such an\\namount lie there untouched, while her caution led her to bury it deeper,\\neven at the risk of the discovery she was too inexperienced to fear.\\n\\nThat she should forget to feign surprise when the alarm of murder was\\nraised was very natural, and so was the fact that a woman with a soul so\\nblunted to all delicate instincts, and with a mind so intent upon\\nperfecting the scheme entered into by the murderer of throwing the blame\\nupon the man whose dagger had been made use of, should persist in\\nvisiting the scene of crime and calling attention to the spot where that\\ndagger had fallen. And so with her manner before her examiners. Baffling\\nas that manner was, it still showed streaks of consistency, when you\\nthought of it as the cloak of a subtle, unprincipled woman, who sees\\namongst her interlocutors the guilty man whom by a word she can destroy,\\nbut whom she exerts herself to save, even at the cost of a series of\\nbizarre explanations. She was playing with a life, a life she loved, but\\nnot with sincerity sufficient to rob the game of a certain delicate, if\\ninconceivable, intellectual enjoyment. [Footnote: That Sweetwater in his\\nhate, and with no real clew to the real situation, should come so near\\nthe truth as in this last supposition, shows the keenness of his\\ninsight.]\\n\\nAnd Frederick? Had there been anything in his former life or in his\\nconduct since the murder to give the lie to these heavy doubts against\\nhim? On the contrary. Though Sweetwater knew little of the dark record\\nwhich had made this young man the disgrace of his family, what he did\\nknow was so much against him that he could well see that the distance\\nusually existing between simple dissipation and desperate crime might be\\neasily bridged by some great necessity for money. Had there been such a\\nnecessity? Sweetwater found it easy to believe so. And Frederick\\'s\\nmanner? Was it that of an honest man simply shocked by the suspicions\\nwhich had fallen upon the woman he loved? Had he, Sweetwater, not\\nobserved certain telltale moments in his late behaviour that required a\\ndeeper explanation even than this?\\n\\nThe cry, for instance, with which he had rushed from the empty ballroom\\ninto the woods on the opposite side of the road! Was it a natural cry or\\nan easily explainable one? \"Thank God! this terrible night is over!\"\\nStrange language to be uttered by this man at such a time and in such a\\nplace, if he did not already know what was to make this night of nights\\nmemorable through all this region. He did know, and this cry which had\\nstruck Sweetwater strangely at the time and still more strangely when he\\nregarded it simply as a coincidence, now took on all the force of a\\nrevelation and the irresistible bubbling up in Frederick\\'s breast of\\nthat remorse which had just found its full expression on Agatha\\'s grave.\\n\\nTo some that remorse and all his other signs of suffering might be\\nexplained by his passion for the real criminal. But to Sweetwater it was\\nonly too evident that an egotist like Frederick Sutherland cannot suffer\\nfor another to such an extent as this, and that a personal explanation\\nmust be given for so personal a grief, even if that explanation involves\\nthe dreadful charge of murder.\\n\\nIt was when Sweetwater reached this point in his reasoning that\\nFrederick disappeared beneath Mr. Halliday\\'s porch, and Mr. Sutherland\\ncame up behind him. After the short conversation in which Sweetwater saw\\nhis own doubts more than reflected in the uneasy consciousness of this\\nstricken father, he went home and the struggle of his life began.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXII\\n\\nSWEETWATER ACTS\\n\\n\\nSweetwater had promised Mr. Sutherland that he would keep counsel in\\nregard to his present convictions concerning Frederick\\'s guilt; but this\\nhe knew he could not do if he remained in Sutherlandtown and fell under\\nthe pitiless examination of Mr. Courtney, the shrewd and able\\nprosecuting attorney of the district. He was too young, too honest, and\\nhad made himself too conspicuous in this affair to succeed in an\\nundertaking requiring so much dissimulation, if not actual falsehood.\\nIndeed, he was not sure that in his present state of mind he could hear\\nFrederick\\'s name mentioned without flushing, and slight as such a hint\\nmight be, it would be enough to direct attention to Frederick, which\\nonce done could but lead to discovery and permanent disgrace to all who\\nbore the name of Sutherland.\\n\\nWhat was he to do then? How avoid a consequence he found himself\\nabsolutely unable to face? It was a problem which this night must solve\\nfor him. But how? As I have said, he went down to his house to think.\\n\\nSweetwater was not a man of absolute rectitude. He was not so much\\nhigh-minded as large-hearted. He had, besides, certain foibles. In the\\nfirst place, he was vain, and vanity in a very plain man is all the more\\nacute since it centres in his capabilities, rather than in his\\nappearance. Had Sweetwater been handsome, or even passably attractive,\\nhe might have been satisfied with the approbation of demure maidens and\\na comradeship with his fellows. But being one who could hope for nothing\\nof this kind, not even for a decent return to the unreasoning\\nheart-worship he felt himself capable of paying, and which he had once\\npaid for a few short days till warned of his presumption by the\\ninsolence of the recipient, he had fixed his hope and his ambition on\\ndoing something which would rouse the admiration of those about him and\\nbring him into that prominence to which he felt himself entitled. That\\nhe, a skilful musician, should desire to be known as a brilliant\\ndetective, is only one of the anomalies of human nature which it would\\nbe folly and a waste of time on our part to endeavour to explain. That,\\nhaving chosen to exercise his wits in this way, he should so well\\nsucceed that he dared not for his life continue in the work he had so\\npublicly undertaken, occasioned in him a pang of disappointment almost\\nas insufferable as that brought by the realisation of what his efforts\\nwere likely to bring upon the man to whose benevolence he owed his very\\nlife. Hence his struggle, which must be measured by the extent of his\\ndesires and the limitations which had been set to his nature by his\\nsurroundings and the circumstances of his life and daily history.\\n\\nIf we enter with him into the humble cottage where he was born and from\\nwhich he had hardly strayed more than a dozen miles in the twenty-two\\nyears of his circumscribed life, we may be able to understand him\\nbetter.\\n\\nIt was an unpainted house perched on an arid hillside, with nothing\\nbefore it but the limitless sea. He had found his way to it\\nmechanically, but as he approached the narrow doorway he paused and\\nturned his face towards the stretch of heaving waters, whose low or loud\\nbooming had been first his cradle song and then the ceaseless\\naccompaniment of his later thoughts and aspirations. It was heaving yet,\\nceaselessly heaving, and in its loud complaint there was a sound of\\nmoaning not always to be found there, or so it seemed to Sweetwater in\\nhis present troubled mood.\\n\\nSighing as this sound reached his ear, and shuddering as its meaning\\ntouched his heart, Sweetwater pushed open the door of his small house,\\nand entered.\\n\\n\"It is I, mamsie!\" he shouted, in what he meant to be his usual voice;\\nbut to a sensitive ear--and what ear is so sensitive as a\\nmother\\'s?--there was a tremble in it that was not wholly natural.\\n\\n\"Is anything the matter, dear?\" called out that mother, in reply.\\n\\nThe question made him start, though he replied quickly enough, and in\\nmore guarded tones:\\n\\n\"No, mamsie. Go to sleep. I\\'m tired, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\nWould to God that was all! He recalled with envy the days when he\\ndragged himself into the house at sundown, after twelve long hours of\\nwork on the docks. As he paused in the dark hallway and listened till he\\nheard the breathing of her who had called him DEAR--the only one in the\\nworld who ever had or ever would call him DEAR--he had glimpses of that\\nold self which made him question if his self-tutoring on the violin, and\\nthe restless ambition which had driven him out of the ways of his\\nancestors into strange attempts for which he was not prepared by any\\nprevious discipline, had brought him happiness or improved his manhood.\\nHe was forced to acknowledge that the sleep of those far-distant nights\\nof his busy boyhood was sweeter than the wakefulness of these later\\ndays, and that it would have been better for him, and infinitely better\\nfor her, if he had remained at the carpenter\\'s bench and been satisfied\\nwith a repetition of his father\\'s existence.\\n\\nHis mother was the only person sharing that small house with him, and\\nonce assured that she was asleep, he lighted a lamp in the empty kitchen\\nand sat down.\\n\\nIt was just twelve o\\'clock. This, to anyone accustomed to this peculiar\\nyoung man\\'s habits, had nothing unusual in it. He was accustomed to come\\nhome late and sit thus by himself for a short time before going\\nup-stairs. But, to one capable of reading his sharp and none too mobile\\ncountenance, there was a change in the character of the brooding into\\nwhich he now sank, which, had that mother been awake to watch him, would\\nhave made every turn of his eye and movement of his hand interesting and\\nimportant.\\n\\nIn the first place, the careless attitude into which he had fallen was\\ntotally at variance with the restless glance which took in every object\\nin that well-known room so associated with his mother and her daily work\\nthat he could not imagine her in any other surroundings, and wondered\\nsometimes if she would seem any longer his mother if transplanted to\\nother scenes and engaged in other tasks.\\n\\nLittle things, petty objects of household use or ornament, which he had\\nseen all his life without specially noticing them, seemed under the\\nstress of his present mood to acquire a sudden importance and fix\\nthemselves indelibly in his memory. There, on a nail driven long before\\nhe was born, hung the little round lid-holder he had pieced together in\\nhis earliest years and presented to his mother in a gush of pride\\ngreater than any he had since experienced. She had never used it, but it\\nalways hung upon the one nail in the one place, as a symbol of his love\\nand of hers. And there, higher up on the end of the shelf barren enough\\nof ornaments, God wot, were a broken toy and a much-defaced primer,\\nmementos likewise of his childhood; and farther along the wall, on a\\nsort of raised bench, a keg, the spigot of which he was once guilty of\\nturning on in his infantile longing for sweets, only to find he could\\nnot turn it back again until all the floor was covered with molasses,\\nand his appetite for the forbidden gratified to the full. And yonder,\\ndangling from a peg, never devoted to any other use, hung his father\\'s\\nold hat, just where he had placed it on the fatal morning when he came\\nin and lay down on the sitting-room lounge for the last time; and close\\nto it, lovingly close to it, Sweetwater thought, his mother\\'s apron, the\\napron he had seen her wear at supper, and which he would see her wear at\\nbreakfast, with all its suggestions of ceaseless work and patient\\nevery-day thrift.\\n\\nSomehow, he could not bear the sight of that apron. With the expectation\\nnow forming in his mind, of leaving this home and leaving this mother,\\nthis symbol of humble toil became an intolerable grief to him. Jumping\\nup, he turned in another direction; but now another group of objects\\nequally eloquent came under his eye. It was his mother\\'s work-basket he\\nsaw, with a piece of sewing in it intended for him, and as if this were\\nnot enough, the table set for two, and at his place a little covered\\ndish which held the one sweetmeat he craved for breakfast. The\\nspectacles lying beside her plate told him how old she was, and as he\\nthought of her failing strength and enfeebled ways, he jumped up again\\nand sought another corner. But here his glances fell on his violin, and\\na new series of emotions awakened within him. He loved the instrument\\nand played as much from natural intuition as acquired knowledge, but in\\nthe plan of action he had laid out for himself his violin could have no\\npart. He would have to leave it behind. Feeling that his regrets were\\nfast becoming too much for him, he left the humble kitchen and went\\nup-stairs. But not to sleep. Locking the door (something he never\\nremembered doing before in all his life), he began to handle over his\\nclothes and other trivial belongings. Choosing out a certain strong\\nsuit, he laid it out on the bed and then went to a bureau drawer and\\ndrew out an old-fashioned wallet. This he opened, but after he had\\ncounted the few bills it contained he shook his head and put them all\\nback, only retaining a little silver, which he slipped into one of the\\npockets of the suit he had chosen. Then he searched for and found a\\nlittle Bible which his mother had once given him. He was about to thrust\\nthat into another pocket, but he seemed to think better of this, too,\\nfor he ended by putting it back into the drawer and taking instead a bit\\nfrom one of his mother\\'s old aprons which he had chanced upon on the\\nstairway. This he placed as carefully in his watch pocket as if it had\\nbeen the picture of a girl he loved. Then he undressed and went to bed.\\n\\nMrs. Sweetwater said afterwards that she never knew Caleb to talk so\\nmuch and eat so little as he did that next morning at breakfast. Such\\nplans as he detailed for unmasking the murderer of Mrs. Webb! Such\\nbusiness for the day! So many people to see! It made her quite dizzy,\\nshe said. And, indeed, Sweetwater was more than usually voluble that\\nmorning,--perhaps because he could not bear his mother\\'s satisfied\\nsmile; and when he went out of the house it was with a laugh and a\\ncheery \"Good-bye, mamsie\" that was in spiking contrast to the\\nirrepressible exclamation of grief which escaped him when the door was\\nclosed between them. Ah, when should he enter those four walls again,\\nand when should he see the old mother?\\n\\nHe proceeded immediately to town. A ship was preparing to sail that\\nmorning for the Brazils, and the wharves were alive with bustle. He\\nstopped a moment to contemplate the great hulk rising and falling at her\\nmoorings, then he passed on and entered the building where he had every\\nreason to expect to find Dr. Talbot and Knapp in discussion. It was very\\nimportant to him that morning to learn just how they felt concerning the\\ngreat matter absorbing him, for if suspicion was taking the direction of\\nFrederick, or if he saw it was at all likely to do so, then would his\\nstruggle be cut short and all necessity for leaving town be at an end.\\nIt was to save Frederick from this danger that he was prepared to cut\\nall the ties binding him to this place, and nothing short of the\\nprospect of accomplishing this would make him willing to undergo such a\\nsacrifice.\\n\\n\"Well, Sweetwater, any news, eh?\" was the half-jeering,\\nhalf-condescending greeting he received from the coroner.\\n\\nSweetwater, who had regained entire control over his feelings as soon as\\nhe found himself under the eye of this man and the supercilious\\ndetective he had attempted to rival, gave a careless shrug and passed\\nthe question on to Knapp. \"Have you any news?\" he asked.\\n\\nKnapp, who would probably not have acknowledged it if he had, smiled the\\nindulgent smile of a self-satisfied superior and uttered a few equivocal\\nsentences. This was gall and wormwood to Sweetwater, but he kept his\\ntemper admirably and, with an air of bravado entirely assumed for the\\noccasion, said to Dr. Talbot:\\n\\n\"I think I shall have something to tell you soon which will materially\\naid you in your search for witnesses. By to-morrow, at least, I shall\\nknow whether I am right or wrong in thinking I have discovered an\\nimportant witness in quite an unexpected quarter.\"\\n\\nSweetwater knew of no new witness, but it was necessary for him not only\\nto have a pretext for the move he contemplated, but to so impress these\\nmen with an idea of his extreme interest in the approaching proceedings,\\nthat no suspicion should ever arise of his having premeditated an escape\\nfrom them. He wished to appear the victim of accident; and this is why\\nhe took nothing from his home which would betray any intention of\\nleaving it.\\n\\n\"Ha! indeed!\" ejaculated the coroner with growing interest. \"And may I\\nask----\"\\n\\n\"Please,\" urged Sweetwater, with a side look at Knapp, \"do not ask me\\nanything just yet. This afternoon, say, after I have had a certain\\ninterview with--What, are they setting sails on the Hesper already?\" he\\nburst out, with a quick glance from the window at the great ship riding\\nat anchor a little distance from them in the harbour. \"There is a man on\\nher I must see. Excuse me--Oh, Mr. Sutherland!\"\\n\\nHe fell back in confusion. That gentleman had just entered the room in\\ncompany with Frederick.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIII\\n\\nA SINISTER PAIR\\n\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" stammered Sweetwater, starting aside and losing on\\nthe instant all further disposition to leave the room.\\n\\nIndeed, he had not the courage to do so, even if he had had the will.\\nThe joint appearance of these two men in this place, and at an hour so\\nfar in advance of that which usually saw Mr. Sutherland enter the town,\\nwas far too significant in his eyes for him to ignore it. Had any\\nexplanation taken place between them, and had Mr. Sutherland\\'s integrity\\ntriumphed over personal considerations to the point of his bringing\\nFrederick here to confess?\\n\\nMeanwhile Dr. Talbot had risen with a full and hearty greeting which\\nproved to Sweetwater\\'s uneasy mind that notwithstanding Knapp\\'s\\ndisquieting reticence no direct suspicion had as yet fallen on the\\nunhappy Frederick. Then he waited for what Mr. Sutherland had to say,\\nfor it was evident he had come there to say something. Sweetwater\\nwaited, too, frozen almost into immobility by the fear that it would be\\nsomething injudicious, for never had he seen any man so changed as Mr.\\nSutherland in these last twelve hours, nor did it need a highly\\npenetrating eye to detect that the relations between him and Frederick\\nwere strained to a point that made it almost impossible for them to more\\nthan assume their old confidential attitude. Knapp, knowing them but\\nsuperficially, did not perceive this, but Dr. Talbot was not blind to\\nit, as was shown by the inquiring look he directed towards them both\\nwhile waiting.\\n\\nMr. Sutherland spoke at last.\\n\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you so early,\" said he, with a certain\\ntremble in his voice which Sweetwater quaked to hear. \"For certain\\nreasons, I should be very glad to know, WE should be very glad to know,\\nif during your investigations into the cause and manner of Agatha Webb\\'s\\ndeath, you have come upon a copy of her will.\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\nTalbot was at once interested, so was Knapp, while Sweetwater withdrew\\nfurther into his corner in anxious endeavour to hide his blanching\\ncheek. \"We have found nothing. We do not even know that she has made a\\nwill.\"\\n\\n\"I ask,\" pursued Mr. Sutherland, with a slight glance toward Frederick,\\nwho seemed, at least in Sweetwater\\'s judgment, to have braced himself up\\nto bear this interview unmoved, \"because I have not only received\\nintimation that she made such a will, but have even been entrusted with\\na copy of it as chief executor of the same. It came to me in a letter\\nfrom Boston yesterday. Its contents were a surprise to me. Frederick,\\nhand me a chair. These accumulated misfortunes--for we all suffer under\\nthe afflictions which have beset this town--have made me feel my years.\"\\n\\nSweetwater drew his breath more freely. He thought he might understand\\nby this last sentence that Mr. Sutherland had come here for a different\\ncause than he had at first feared. Frederick, on the contrary, betrayed\\na failing ability to hide his emotion. He brought his father a chair,\\nplaced it, and was drawing back out of sight when Mr. Sutherland\\nprevented him by a mild command to hand the paper he had brought to the\\ncoroner.\\n\\nThere was something in his manner that made Sweetwater lean forward and\\nFrederick look up, so that the father\\'s and son\\'s eyes met under that\\nyoung man\\'s scrutiny. But while he saw meaning in both their regards,\\nthere was nothing like collusion, and, baffled by these appearances,\\nwhich, while interesting, told him little or nothing, he transferred his\\nattention to Dr. Talbot and Knapp, who had drawn together to see what\\nthis paper contained.\\n\\n\"As I have said, the contents of this will are a surprise to me,\"\\nfaltered Mr. Sutherland. \"They are equally so to my son. He can hardly\\nbe said to have been a friend even of the extraordinary woman who thus\\nleaves him her whole fortune.\"\\n\\n\"I never spoke with her but twice,\" exclaimed Frederick with a studied\\ncoldness, which was so evidently the cloak of inner agitation that\\nSweetwater trembled for its effect, notwithstanding the state of his own\\nthoughts, which were in a ferment. Frederick, the inheritor of Agatha\\nWebb\\'s fortune! Frederick, concerning whom his father had said on the\\nprevious night that he possessed no motive for wishing this good woman\\'s\\ndeath! Was it the discovery that such a motive existed which had so aged\\nthis man in the last twelve hours? Sweetwater dared not turn again to\\nsee. His own face might convey too much of his own fears, doubts, and\\nstruggle.\\n\\nBut the coroner, for whose next words Sweetwater listened with acute\\nexpectancy, seemed to be moved simply by the unexpectedness of the\\noccurrence. Glancing at Frederick with more interest than he had ever\\nbefore shown him, he cried with a certain show of enthusiasm:\\n\\n\"A pretty fortune! A very pretty fortune!\" Then with a deprecatory air\\nnatural to him in addressing Mr. Sutherland, \"Would it be indiscreet for\\nme to ask to what our dear friend Agatha alludes in her reference to\\nyour late lamented wife?\" His finger was on a clause of the will and his\\nlips next minute mechanically repeated what he was pointing at:\\n\\n\"\\'In remembrance of services rendered me in early life by Marietta\\nSutherland, wife of Charles Sutherland of Sutherlandtown, I bequeath to\\nFrederick, sole child of her affection, all the property, real and\\npersonal, of which I die possessed.\\' Services rendered! They must have\\nbeen very important ones,\" suggested Dr. Talbot.\\n\\nMr. Sutherland\\'s expression was one of entire perplexity and doubt.\\n\\n\"I do not remember my wife ever speaking of any special act of kindness\\nshe was enabled to show Agatha Webb. They were always friends, but never\\nintimate ones. However, Agatha could be trusted to make no mistake. She\\ndoubtless knew to what she referred. Mrs. Sutherland was fully capable\\nof doing an extremely kind act in secret.\"\\n\\nFor all his respect for the speaker, Dr. Talbot did not seem quite\\nsatisfied. He glanced at Frederick and fumbled the paper uneasily.\\n\\n\"Perhaps you were acquainted with the reason for this legacy--this large\\nlegacy,\" he emphasised.\\n\\nFrederick, thus called upon, nay, forced to speak, raised his head, and\\nwithout perhaps bestowing so much as a thought on the young man behind\\nhim who was inwardly quivering in anxious expectancy of some betrayal on\\nhis part which would precipitate disgrace and lifelong sorrow on all who\\nbore the name of Sutherland, met Dr. Talbot\\'s inquiring glance with a\\nsimple earnestness surprising to them all, and said:\\n\\n\"My record is so much against me that I am not surprised that you wonder\\nat my being left with Mrs. Webb\\'s fortune. Perhaps she did not fully\\nrealise the lack of estimation in which I am deservedly held in this\\nplace, or perhaps, and this would be much more like her, she hoped that\\nthe responsibility of owing my independence to so good and so\\nunfortunate a woman might make a man of me.\"\\n\\nThere was a manliness in Frederick\\'s words and bearing that took them\\nall by surprise. Mr. Sutherland\\'s dejection visibly lightened, while\\nSweetwater, conscious of the more than vital interests hanging upon the\\nimpression which might be made by this event upon the minds of the men\\npresent, turned slightly so as to bring their faces into the line of his\\nvision.\\n\\nThe result was a conviction that as yet no real suspicion of Frederick\\nhad seized upon either of their minds. Knapp\\'s face was perfectly calm\\nand almost indifferent, while the good coroner, who saw this and every\\nother circumstance connected with this affair through the one medium of\\nhis belief in Amabel\\'s guilt, was surveying Frederick with something\\nlike sympathy.\\n\\n\"I fear,\" said he, \"that others were not as ignorant of your prospective\\ngood fortune as you were yourself,\" at which Frederick\\'s cheek turned a\\ndark red, though he said nothing, and Sweetwater, with a sudden\\ninvoluntary gesture indicative of resolve, gazed for a moment\\nbreathlessly at the ship, and then with an unexpected and highly\\nimpetuous movement dashed from the room crying loudly:\\n\\n\"I\\'ve seen him! I\\'ve seen him! he\\'s just going on board the ship. Wait\\nfor me, Dr. Talbot. I\\'ll be back in fifteen minutes with such a\\nwitness--\"\\n\\nHere the door slammed. But they could hear his hurrying footsteps as he\\nplunged down the stairs and rushed away from the building.\\n\\nIt was an unexpected termination to an interview fast becoming\\nunbearable to the two Sutherlands, but no one, not even the old\\ngentleman himself, took in its full significance.\\n\\nHe was, however, more than agitated by the occurrence and could hardly\\nprevent himself from repeating aloud Sweetwater\\'s final word, which\\nafter their interview at Mr. Halliday\\'s gate, the night before, seemed\\nto convey to him at once a warning and a threat. To keep himself from\\nwhat he feared might prove a self-betrayal, he faltered out in very\\nevident dismay:\\n\\n\"What is the matter? What has come over the lad?\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Dr. Talbot, \"he\\'s been watching that ship for an hour. He is\\nafter some man he has just seen go aboard her. Says he\\'s a new and\\nimportant witness in this case. Perhaps he is. Sweetwater is no man\\'s\\nfool, for all his small eyes and retreating chin. If you want proof of\\nit, wait till he comes back. He\\'ll be sure to have something to say.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile they had all pressed forward to the window. Frederick, who\\ncarefully kept his face out of his father\\'s view, bent half-way over the\\nsill in his anxiety to watch the flying figure of Sweetwater, who was\\nmaking straight for the dock, while Knapp, roused at last, leaned over\\nhis shoulder and pointed to the sailors on the deck, who were pulling in\\nthe last ropes, preparatory to sailing.\\n\\n\"He\\'s too late: they won\\'t let him aboard now. What a fool to hang\\naround here till he saw his man, instead of being at the dock to nab\\nhim! That comes of trusting a country bumpkin. I knew he\\'d fail us at\\nthe pinch. They lack training, these would-be detectives. See, now! He\\'s\\nrun up against the mate, and the mate pushes him back. His cake is all\\ndough, unless he\\'s got a warrant. Has he a warrant, Dr. Talbot?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the coroner, \"he didn\\'t ask for one. He didn\\'t even tell me\\nwhom he wanted. Can it be one of those two passengers you see on the\\nforward deck, there?\"\\n\\nIt might well be. Even from a distance these two men presented a\\nsinister appearance that made them quite marked figures among the crowd\\nof hurrying sailors and belated passengers.\\n\\n\"One of them is peering over the rail with a very evident air of\\nanxiety. His eye is on Sweetwater, who is dancing with impatience. See,\\nhe is gesticulating like a monkey, and--By the powers, they are going to\\nlet him go aboard!\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland, who had been leaning heavily against the window-jamb in\\nthe agitation of doubt and suspense which Sweetwater\\'s unaccountable\\nconduct had evoked, here crossed to the other side and stole a\\ndetermined look at Frederick. Was his son personally interested in this\\nattempt of the amateur detective? Did he know whom Sweetwater sought,\\nand was he suffering as much or more than himself from the uncertainty\\nand fearful possibilities of the moment? He thought he knew Frederick\\'s\\nface, and that he read dread there, but Frederick had changed so\\ncompletely since the commission of this crime that even his father could\\nno longer be sure of the correct meaning either of his words or\\nexpression.\\n\\nThe torture of the moment continued.\\n\\n\"He climbs like a squirrel,\" remarked Dr. Talbot, with a touch of\\nenthusiasm. \"Look at him now--he\\'s on the quarterdeck and will be down\\nin the cabins before you can say Jack Robinson. I warrant they have told\\nhim to hurry. Captain Dunlap isn\\'t the man to wait five minutes after\\nthe ropes are pulled in.\"\\n\\n\"Those two men have shrunk away behind some mast or other,\" cried Knapp.\\n\"They are the fellows he\\'s after. But what can they have to do with the\\nmurder? Have you ever seen them here about town, Dr. Talbot?\"\\n\\n\"Not that I remember; they have a foreign air about them. Look like\\nSouth Americans.\"\\n\\n\"Well, they\\'re going to South America. Sweetwater can\\'t stop them. He\\nhas barely time to get off the ship himself. There goes the last rope!\\nHave they forgotten him? They\\'re drawing up the ladder.\"\\n\\n\"No: the mate stops them; see, he\\'s calling the fellow. I can hear his\\nvoice, can\\'t you? Sweetwater\\'s game is up. He\\'ll have to leave in a\\nhurry. What\\'s the rumpus now?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, only they\\'ve scattered to look for him; the fox is down in the\\ncabins and won\\'t come up, laughing in his sleeve, no doubt, at keeping\\nthe vessel waiting while he hunts up his witness.\"\\n\\n\"If it\\'s one of those two men he\\'s laying a trap for he won\\'t snare him\\nin a hurry. They\\'re sneaks, those two, and--Why, the sailors are coming\\nback shaking their heads. I can almost hear from here the captain\\'s\\noaths.\"\\n\\n\"And such a favourable wind for getting out of the harbour! Sweetwater,\\nmy boy, you are distinguishing yourself. If your witness don\\'t pan out\\nwell you won\\'t hear the last of this in a hurry.\"\\n\\n\"It looks as if they meant to sail without waiting to put him ashore,\"\\nobserved Frederick in a low tone, too carefully modulated not to strike\\nhis father as unnatural.\\n\\n\"By jingoes, so it does!\" ejaculated Knapp. \"There go the sails! The\\npilot\\'s hand is on the wheel, and Dr. Talbot, are you going to let your\\ncunning amateur detective and his important witness slip away from you\\nlike this?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot help myself,\" said the coroner, a little dazed himself at this\\nunexpected chance. \"My voice wouldn\\'t reach them from this place;\\nbesides they wouldn\\'t heed me if it did. The ship is already under way\\nand we won\\'t see Sweetwater again till the pilot\\'s boat comes back.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland moved from the window and crossed to the door like a man\\nin a dream. Frederick, instantly conscious of his departure, turned to\\nfollow him, but presently stopped and addressing Knapp for the first\\ntime, observed quietly:\\n\\n\"This is all very exciting, but I think your estimate of this fellow\\nSweetwater is just. He\\'s a busybody and craves notoriety above\\neverything. He had no witness on board, or, if he had, it was an\\nimaginary one. You will see him return quite crestfallen before night,\\nwith some trumped-up excuse of mistaken identity.\"\\n\\nThe shrug which Knapp gave dismissed Sweetwater as completely from the\\naffair as if he had never been in it.\\n\\n\"I think I may now regard myself as having this matter in my sole\\ncharge,\" was his curt remark, as he turned away, while Frederick, with a\\nrespectful bow to Dr. Talbot, remarked in leaving:\\n\\n\"I am at your service, Dr. Talbot, if you require me to testify at the\\ninquest in regard to this will. My testimony can all be concentrated\\ninto the one sentence, \\'I did not expect this bequest, and have no\\ntheories to advance in explanation of it.\\' But it has made me feel\\nmyself Mrs. Webb\\'s debtor, and given me a justifiable interest in the\\ninquiry which, I am told, you open to-morrow into the cause and manner\\nof her death. If there is a guilty person in this case, I shall raise no\\nbarrier in the way of his conviction.\"\\n\\nAnd while the coroner\\'s face still showed the embarrassment which this\\nlast sentence called up, his mind being now, as ever, fixed on Amabel,\\nFrederick offered his arm to his father, whose condition was not\\nimproved by the excitements of the last half-hour, and proceeded to lead\\nhim from the building.\\n\\nWhatever they thought, or however each strove to hide their conclusions\\nfrom the other, no words passed between them till they came in full\\nsight of the sea, on a distant billow of which the noble-ship bound for\\nthe Brazils rode triumphantly on its outward course. Then Mr. Sutherland\\nremarked, with a suggestive glance at the vessel:\\n\\n\"The young man who has found an unexpected passage on that vessel will\\nnot come back with the pilot.\"\\n\\nWas the sigh which was Frederick\\'s only answer one of relief? It\\ncertainly seemed so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIV\\n\\nIN THE SHADOW OP THE MAST\\n\\n\\nMr. Sutherland was right. Sweetwater did not return with the pilot.\\nAccording to the latter there was no Sweetwater on board the ship to\\nreturn. At all events the minutest search had not succeeded in finding\\nhim in the cabins, though no one had seen him leave the vessel, or,\\nindeed, seen him at all after his hasty dash below decks. It was thought\\non board that he had succeeded in reaching shore before the ship set\\nsail, and the pilot was suitably surprised at learning this was not so.\\nSo were Sweetwater\\'s friends and associates with the exception of a\\ncertain old gentleman living on the hill, and Knapp the detective. He,\\nthat is the latter, had his explanation at his tongue\\'s end:\\n\\n\"Sweetwater is a fakir. He thought he could carry off the honours from\\nthe regular force, and when he found he couldn\\'t he quietly disappeared.\\nWe shall hear of him again in the Brazils.\"\\n\\nAn opinion that speedily gained ground, so that in a few hours\\nSweetwater was all but forgotten, save by his mother, whose heart was\\nfilled with suspense, and by Mr. Sutherland, whose breast was burdened\\nby gratitude. The amazing fact of Frederick, the village scapegrace and\\nAmabel\\'s reckless, if aristocratic, lover, having been made the legatee\\nof the upright Mrs. Webb\\'s secret savings had something to do with this.\\nWith such a topic at hand, not only the gossips, but those who had the\\nmatter of Agatha\\'s murder in hand, found ample material to occupy their\\nthoughts and tongues, without wasting time over a presumptuous busybody,\\nwho had not wits enough to know that five minutes before sailing-time is\\nan unfortunate moment in which to enter a ship.\\n\\nAnd where was Sweetwater, that he could not be found on the shore or on\\nthe ship? We will follow him and see. Accustomed from his youth to\\nramble over the vessels while in port, he knew this one as well as he\\ndid his mother\\'s house. It was, therefore, a surprise to the sailors\\nwhen, shortly after the departure of the pilot, they came upon him lying\\nin the hold, half buried under a box which had partially fallen upon\\nhim. He was unconscious, or appeared to be so, and when brought into\\nopen light showed marks of physical distress and injury; but his eye was\\nclear and his expression hardly as rueful as one would expect in a man\\nwho finds himself en route for the Brazils with barely a couple of\\ndollars in his pocket and every prospect of being obliged to work before\\nthe mast to earn his passage. Even the captain noticed this and eyed him\\nwith suspicion. But Sweetwater, rousing to the necessities of the\\noccasion, forthwith showed such a mixture of discouragement and\\nperplexity that the honest sailor was deceived and abated half at least\\nof his oaths. He gave Sweetwater a hammock and admitted him to the mess,\\nbut told him that as soon as his bruises allowed him to work he should\\nshow himself on deck or expect the rough treatment commonly bestowed on\\nstowaways.\\n\\nIt was a prospect to daunt some men, but not Sweetwater. Indeed it was\\nno more than he had calculated upon when he left his savings behind with\\nhis old mother and entered upon this enterprise with only a little\\nchange in his pocket. He had undertaken out of love and gratitude to Mr.\\nSutherland to rid Frederick of a dangerous witness and he felt able to\\ncomplete the sacrifice. More than that, he was even strangely happy for\\na time. The elation of the willing victim was his, that is for a few\\nshort hours, then he began to think of his mother. How had she borne his\\nsudden departure? What would she think had befallen him, and how long\\nwould he have to wait before he could send her word of his safety? If he\\nwas to be of real service to the man he venerated, he must be lost long\\nenough for the public mind to have become settled in regard to the\\nmysteries of the Webb murder and for his own boastful connection with it\\nto be forgotten. This might mean years of exile. He rather thought it\\ndid; meanwhile his mother! Of himself he thought little.\\n\\nBy sundown he felt himself sufficiently recovered from his bruises to go\\nup on deck. It was a mild night, and the sea was running in smooth long\\nwaves that as yet but faintly presaged the storm brewing on the distant\\nhorizon. As he inhaled the fresh air, the joy of renewed health began to\\ninfuse its life into his veins and lift the oppression from his heart,\\nand, glad of a few minutes of quiet enjoyment, he withdrew to a solitary\\nportion of the deck and allowed himself to forget his troubles in\\ncontemplation of the rapidly deepening sky and boundless stretch of\\nwaters.\\n\\nBut such griefs and anxieties as weighed upon this man\\'s breast are not\\nso easily shaken off. Before he realised it his thoughts had recurred to\\nthe old theme, and he was wondering if he was really of sufficient\\ninsignificance in the eyes of his fellow-townsmen not to be sought for\\nand found in that distant country to which he was bound. Would they, in\\nspite of his precautions, suspect that he had planned this evasion and\\ninsist on his return, or would he be allowed to slip away and drop out\\nof sight like the white froth he was watching on the top of the\\never-shifting waves? He had boasted of possessing a witness. Would they\\nbelieve that boast and send a detective in search of him, or would they\\ntake his words for the bombast they really were and proceed with their\\ninvestigations in happy relief at the loss of his intrusive assistance?\\n\\nAs this was a question impossible for him to answer, he turned to other\\nthoughts and fretted himself for a while with memories of Amabel\\'s\\ndisdain and Frederick\\'s careless acceptance of a sacrifice he could\\nnever know the cost of, mixed strangely with relief at being free of it\\nall and on the verge of another life. As the dark settled, his head fell\\nfarther and farther forward on the rail he was leaning against, till he\\nbecame to any passing eye but a blurred shadow mixing with other shadows\\nequally immovable.\\n\\nUnlike them, however, his shadow suddenly shifted. Two men had drawn\\nnear him, one speaking pure Spanish and the other English. The English\\nwas all that Sweetwater could understand, and this half of the\\nconversation was certainly startling enough. Though he could not, of\\ncoarse, know to what or whom it referred, and though it certainly had\\nnothing to do with him, or any interest he represented or understood, he\\ncould not help listening and remembering every word. The\\nEnglish-speaking man uttered the first sentence he comprehended. It was\\nthis:\\n\\n\"Shall it be to-night?\"\\n\\nThe answer was in Spanish.\\n\\nAgain the English voice:\\n\\n\"He has come up. I saw him distinctly as he passed the second mast.\"\\n\\nMore Spanish; then English:\\n\\n\"You may if you want to, but I\\'ll never breathe easy while he\\'s on the\\nship. Are you sure he\\'s the fellow we fear?\"\\n\\nA rapid flow of words from which Sweetwater got nothing. Then slowly and\\ndistinctly in the sinister tones he had already begun to shiver at:\\n\\n\"Very good. The R. F. A. should pay well for this,\" with the quick\\naddition following a hurried whisper: \"All right! I\\'d send a dozen men\\nto the bottom for half that money. But \\'ware there! Here\\'s a fellow\\nwatching us! If he has heard--\"\\n\\nSweetwater turned, saw two desperate faces projected toward him,\\nrealised that something awful, unheard of, was about to happen, and\\nwould have uttered a yell of dismay, but that the very intensity of his\\nfright took away his breath. The next minute he felt himself launched\\ninto space and enveloped in the darkness of the chilling waters. He had\\nbeen lifted bodily and flung headlong into the sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXV\\n\\nIN EXTREMITY\\n\\n\\nSweetwater\\'s one thought as he sank was, \"Now Mr. Sutherland need fear\\nme no longer.\"\\n\\nBut the instinct of life is strong in every heart, and when he found\\nhimself breathing the air again he threw out his arms wildly and grasped\\na spar.\\n\\nIt was life to him, hope, reconnection with his kind. He clutched,\\nclung, and, feeling himself floating, uttered a shout of mingled joy and\\nappeal that unhappily was smothered in the noise of the waters and the\\nnow rapidly rising wind.\\n\\nWhence had come this spar in his desperate need? He never knew, but\\nsomewhere in his remote consciousness an impression remained of a shock\\nto the waves following his own plunge into the water, which might mean\\nthat this spar had been thrown out after him, perhaps by the already\\nrepentant hands of the wretches who had tossed him to his death. However\\nit came, or from whatever source, it had at least given him an\\nopportunity to measure his doom and realise the agonies of hope when it\\nalternates with despair.\\n\\nThe darkness was impenetrable. It was no longer that of heaven, but of\\nthe nether world, or so it seemed to this dazed soul, plunged suddenly\\nfrom dreams of exile into the valley of the shadow of death. And such a\\ndeath! As he realised its horrors, as he felt the chill of night and the\\noncoming storm strike its piercing fangs into his marrow, and knew that\\nhis existence and the hope of ever again seeing the dear old face at the\\nfireside rested upon the strength of his will and the tenacity of his\\nlife-clutch, he felt his heart fail, and the breath that was his life\\ncease in a gurgle of terror. But he clung on, and, though no comfort\\ncame, still clung, while vague memories of long-ago shipwrecks, and\\nstories told in his youth of men, women, and children tossing for hours\\non a drifting plank, flashed through his benumbed brain, and lent their\\nhorror to his own sensations of apprehension and despair.\\n\\nHe wanted to live. Now that the dread spectre had risen out of the water\\nand had its clutch on his hair, he realised that the world held much for\\nhim, and that even in exile he might work and love and enjoy God\\'s\\nheaven and earth, the green fields and the blue sky. Not such skies as\\nwere above him now. No, this was not sky that overarched him, but a\\nhorrible vault in which the clouds, rushing in torn masses, had the\\naspect of demons stooping to contend for him with those other demons\\nthat with long arms and irresistible grip were dragging at him from\\nbelow. He was alone on a whirling spar in the midst of a midnight ocean,\\nbut horror and a pitiless imagination made this conflict more than that\\nof the elements, and his position an isolation beyond that of man\\nremoved from his fellows. He was almost mad. Yet he clung.\\n\\nSuddenly a better frame of mind prevailed. The sky was no lighter, save\\nas the lightning came to relieve the overwhelming darkness by a still\\nmore overwhelming glare, nor were the waves less importunate or his hold\\non the spar more secure; but the horror seemed to have lifted, and the\\npractical nature of the man reasserted itself. Other men had gone\\nthrough worse dangers than these and survived to tell the tale, as he\\nmight survive to tell his. The will was all--will and an indomitable\\ncourage; and he had will and he had courage, or why had he left his home\\nto dare a hard and threatening future purely from a sentiment of\\ngratitude? Could he hold on long enough, daylight would come; and if, as\\nhe now thought possible, he had been thrown into the sea within twenty\\nhours after leaving Sutherlandtown, then he must be not far from Cape\\nCod, and in the direct line of travel from New York to Boston. Rescue\\nwould come, and if the storm which was breaking over his head more and\\nmore furiously made it difficult for him to retain his hold, it\\ncertainly would not wreck his spar or drench him more than he was\\nalready drenched, while every blast would drive him shoreward. The\\nclinging was all, and filial love would make him do that, even in the\\nsemi-unconsciousness which now and then swept over him. Only, would it\\nnot be better for Mr. Sutherland if he should fail and drop away into\\nthe yawning chasms of the unknown world beneath? There were moments when\\nhe thought so, and then his clutch perceptibly weakened; but only once\\ndid he come near losing his hold altogether. And that was when he\\nthought he heard a laugh. A laugh, here in the midst of ocean! in the\\nmidst of storm! a laugh! Were demons a reality, then? Yes; but the demon\\nhe had heard was of his own imagination; it had a face of Medusa\\nsweetness and the laugh--Only Amabel\\'s rang out so thrillingly false,\\nand with such diabolic triumph. Amabel, who might be laughing in her\\ndreams at this very moment of his supreme misery, and who assuredly\\nwould laugh if conscious of his suffering and aware of the doom to which\\nhis self-sacrifice had brought him. Amabel! the thought of her made the\\nnight more dark, the waters more threatening, the future less promising.\\nYet he would hold on if only to spite her who hated him and whom he\\nhated almost as much as he loved Mr. Sutherland.\\n\\nIt was his last conscious thought for hours. When morning broke he was\\nbut a nerveless figure, with sense enough to cling, and that was all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVI\\n\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE PARCEL\\n\\n\\n\"A man! Haul him in! Don\\'t leave a poor fellow drifting about like\\nthat.\"\\n\\nThe speaker, a bluff, hearty skipper, whose sturdy craft had outridden\\none of the worst storms of the season, pointed to our poor friend\\nSweetwater, whose head could just be seen above the broken spar he clung\\nto. In another moment a half-dozen hands were stretched for him, and the\\ninsensible form was drawn in and laid on a deck which still showed the\\nresults of the night\\'s fierce conflict with the waters.\\n\\n\"Damn it! how ugly he is!\" cried one of the sailors, with a leer at the\\nhalf-drowned man\\'s face. \"I\\'d like to see the lass we\\'d please in saving\\nhim. He\\'s only fit to poison a devil-fish!\"\\n\\nBut though more than one laugh rang out, they gave him good care, and\\nwhen Sweetwater came to life and realised that his blood was pulsing\\nwarmly again through his veins, and that a grey sky had taken the place\\nof darkness, and a sound board supported limbs which for hours had\\nyielded helplessly to the rocking billows, he saw a ring of hard but\\ngood-natured faces about him and realised quite well what had been done\\nfor him when one of them said:\\n\\n\"There! he\\'ll do now; all hands on deck! We can get into New Bedford in\\ntwo days if this wind holds. Nor\\' west!\" shouted the skipper to the man\\nat the tiller. \"We\\'ll sup with our old women in forty-eight hours!\"\\n\\nNew Bedford! It was the only word Sweetwater heard. So, he was no\\nfarther away from Sutherlandtown than that. Evidently Providence had not\\nmeant him to escape. Or was it his fortitude that was being tried? A man\\nas humble as he might easily be lost even in a place as small as New\\nBedford. It was his identity he must suppress. With that unrecognised he\\nmight remain in the next village to Sutherlandtown without fear of being\\ncalled up as a witness against Frederick. But could he suppress it? He\\nthought he could. At all events he meant to try.\\n\\n\"What\\'s your name?\" were the words he now heard shouted in his ear.\\n\\n\"Jonathan Briggs,\" was his mumbled reply. \"I was blown off a ship\\'s deck\\nin the gale last night.\"\\n\\n\"What ship?\"\\n\\n\"The Proserpine.\" It was the first name that suggested itself to him.\\n\\n\"Oh, I thought it might have been the Hesper; she foundered off here\\nlast night.\"\\n\\n\"Foundered? The Hesper?\" The hot blood was shooting now through his\\nveins.\\n\\n\"Yes, we just picked up her name-board. That was before we got a hold on\\nyou.\"\\n\\nFoundered! The ship from which he had been so mercilessly thrown! And\\nall on board lost, perhaps. He began to realise the hand of Providence\\nin his fate.\\n\\n\"It was the Hesper I sailed on. I\\'m not just clear yet in my head. My\\nfirst voyage was made on the Proserpine. Well, bless the gale that blew\\nme from that deck!\"\\n\\nHe seemed incoherent, and they left him again for a little while. When\\nthey came back he had his story all ready, which imposed upon them just\\nso far as it was for their interest. Their business on this coast was\\nnot precisely legitimate, and when they found he simply wanted to be set\\non shore, they were quite willing to do thus much for him. Only they\\nregretted that he had barely two dollars and his own soaked clothing to\\ngive in exchange for the motley garments they trumped up among them for\\nhis present comfort. But he, as well as they, made the best of a bad\\nbargain, he especially, as his clothes, which would be soon scattered\\namong half a dozen families, were the only remaining clew connecting him\\nwith his native town. He could now be Jonathan Briggs indeed. Only who\\nwas Jonathan Briggs, and how was he to earn a living under these\\nunexpected conditions?\\n\\nAt the end of a couple of days he was dexterously landed on the end of a\\nlong pier, which they passed without stopping, on their way to their own\\nobscure anchorage. As he jumped from the rail to the pier and felt again\\nthe touch of terra firma he drew a long breath of uncontrollable\\nelation. Yet he had not a cent in the world, no friends, and certainly\\nno prospects. He did not even know whether to turn to the right or the\\nleft as he stepped out upon the docks, and when he had decided to turn\\nto the right as being on the whole more lucky, he did not know whether\\nto risk his fortune in the streets of the town or to plunge into one of\\nthe low-browed drinking houses whose signs confronted him on this\\nwater-lane.\\n\\nHe decided that his prospects for a dinner were slim in any case, and\\nthat his only hope of breaking fast that day lay in the use he might\\nmake of one of his three talents. Either he must find a fiddle to play\\non, a carpenter\\'s bench to work at, or a piece of detective shadowing to\\ndo. The last would bring him before the notice of the police, which was\\njust the thing he must avoid; so it was fiddling or carpentry he must\\nseek, either of which would be difficult to obtain in his present garb.\\nBut of difficulties Sweetwater was not a man to take note. He had\\nundertaken out of pure love for a good man to lose himself. He had\\naccomplished this, and now was he to complain because in doing so he was\\nlikely to go hungry for a day or two? No; Amabel might laugh at him, or\\nhe might fancy she did, while struggling in the midst of rapidly\\nengulfing waters, but would she laugh at him now? He did not think she\\nwould. She was of the kind who sometimes go hungry themselves in old\\nage. Some premonition of this might give her a fellow feeling.\\n\\nHe came to a stand before a little child sitting on an ill-kept\\ndoorstep. Smiling at her kindly, he waited for her first expression to\\nsee how he appeared in the eyes of innocence. Not so bad a man, it\\nseemed, though his naturally plain countenance was not relieved by the\\nseaman\\'s cap and knitted shirt he wore. For she laughed as she looked at\\nhim, and only ran away because there wasn\\'t room for him to pass beside\\nher.\\n\\nComforted a little, he sauntered on, glancing here and there with that\\nsharp eye of his for a piece of work to be done. Suddenly he came to a\\nhalt. A market-woman had got into an altercation with an oysterman, and\\nher stall had been upset in the contention, and her vegetables were\\nrolling here and there. He righted her stall, picked up her vegetables,\\nand in return got two apples and a red herring he would not have given\\nto a dog at home. Yet it was the sweetest morsel he had ever tasted, and\\nthe apples might have been grown in the garden of the Hesperides from\\nthe satisfaction and pleasure they gave this hungry man. Then,\\nrefreshed, he dashed into the town. It should now go hard but he would\\nearn a night\\'s lodging.\\n\\nThe day was windy and he was going along a narrow street, when something\\nfloated down from a window above past his head. It was a woman\\'s veil,\\nand as he looked up to see where it came from he met the eyes of its\\nowner looking down from an open casement above him. She was\\ngesticulating, and seemed to point to someone up the street. Glad to\\nseize at anything which promised emolument or adventure, he shouted up\\nand asked her what she wanted.\\n\\n\"That man down there!\" she cried; \"the one in a long black coat going up\\nthe street. Keep after him and stop him; tell him the telegram has come.\\nQuick, quick, before he gets around the corner! He will pay you; run!\"\\n\\nSweetwater, with joy in his heart,--for five cents was a boon to him in\\nthe present condition of his affairs,--rushed after the man she had\\npointed out and hastily stopped him.\\n\\n\"Someone,\" he added, \"a woman in a window back there, bade me run after\\nyou and say the telegram has come. She told me you would pay me,\" he\\nadded, for he saw the man was turning hastily back, without thinking of\\nthe messenger. \"I need the money, and the run was a sharp one.\"\\n\\nWith a preoccupied air, the man thrust his hand into his pocket, pulled\\nout a coin, and handed it to him. Then he walked hurriedly off.\\nEvidently the news was welcome to him. But Sweetwater stood rooted to\\nthe ground. The man had given him a five-dollar gold piece instead of\\nthe nickel he had evidently intended.\\n\\nHow hungrily Sweetwater eyed that coin! In it was lodging, food, perhaps\\na new article or so of clothing. But after a moment of indecision which\\nmight well be forgiven him, he followed speedily after the man and\\novertook him just as he reached the house from which the woman\\'s veil\\nhad floated.\\n\\n\"Sir, pardon me; but you gave me five dollars instead of five cents. It\\nwas a mistake; I cannot keep the money.\"\\n\\nThe man, who was not just the sort from whom kindness would be expected,\\nlooked at the money in Sweetwater\\'s palm, then at the miserable,\\nmud-bespattered clothes he wore (he had got that mud helping the poor\\nmarket-woman), and stared hard at the face of the man who looked so\\nneedy and yet returned him five dollars.\\n\\n\"You\\'re an honest fellow,\" he declared, not offering to take back the\\ngold piece. Then, with a quick glance up at the window, \"Would you like\\nto earn that money?\"\\n\\nSweetwater broke out into a smile, which changed his whole countenance.\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t I, sir?\"\\n\\nThe man eyed him for another minute with scrutinising intensity. Then he\\nsaid shortly:\\n\\n\"Come up-stairs with me.\"\\n\\nThey entered the house, went up a flight or two, and stopped at a door\\nwhich was slightly ajar.\\n\\n\"We are going into the presence of a lady,\" remarked the man. \"Wait here\\nuntil I call you.\"\\n\\nSweetwater waited, the many thoughts going through his mind not\\npreventing him from observing all that passed.\\n\\nThe man, who had left the door wide open, approached the lady who was\\nawaiting him, and who was apparently the same one who had sent\\nSweetwater on his errand, and entered into a low but animated\\nconversation. She held a telegram in her hand which she showed him, and\\nthen after a little earnest parley and a number of pleading looks from\\nthem both toward the waiting Sweetwater, she disappeared into another\\nroom, from which she brought a parcel neatly done up, which she handed\\nto the man with a strange gesture. Another hurried exchange of words and\\na meaning look which did not escape the sharp eye of the watchful\\nmessenger, and the man turned and gave the parcel into Sweetwater\\'s\\nhands.\\n\\n\"You are to carry this,\" said he, \"to the town hall. In the second room\\nto the right on entering you will see a table surrounded by chairs,\\nwhich at this hour ought to be empty. At the head of the table you will\\nfind an arm-chair. On the table directly in front of this you will lay\\nthis packet. Mark you, directly before the chair and not too far from\\nthe edge of the table. Then you are to come out. If you see anyone, say\\nyou came to leave some papers for Mr. Gifford. Do this and you may keep\\nthe five dollars and welcome.\"\\n\\nSweetwater hesitated. There was something in the errand or in the manner\\nof the man and woman that he did not like.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t potter!\" spoke up the latter, with an impatient look at her\\nwatch. \"Mr. Gifford will expect those papers.\"\\n\\nSweetwater\\'s sensitive fingers closed on the package he held. It did not\\nfeel like papers.\\n\\n\"Are you going?\" asked the man.\\n\\nSweetwater looked up with a smile. \"Large pay for so slight a\\ncommission,\" he ventured, turning the packet over and over in his hand.\\n\\n\"But then you will execute it at once, and according to the instructions\\nI have given you,\" retorted the man. \"It is your trustworthiness I pay\\nfor. Now go.\"\\n\\nSweetwater turned to go. After all it was probably all right, and five\\ndollars easily earned is doubly five dollars. As he reached the\\nstaircase he stumbled. The shoes he wore did not fit him.\\n\\n\"Be careful, there!\" shouted the woman, in a shrill, almost frightened\\nvoice, while the man stumbled back into the room in a haste which seemed\\nwholly uncalled for. \"If you let the packet fall you will do injury to\\nits contents. Go softly, man, go softly!\"\\n\\nYet they had said it held papers!\\n\\nTroubled, yet hardly knowing what his duty was, Sweetwater hastened down\\nthe stairs, and took his way up the street. The town hall should be easy\\nto find; indeed, he thought he saw it in the distance. As he went, he\\nasked himself two questions: Could he fail to deliver the package\\naccording to instructions, and yet earn his money? And was there any way\\nof so delivering it without risk to the recipient or dereliction of duty\\nto the man who had intrusted it to him and whose money he wished to\\nearn? To the first question his conscience at once answered no; to the\\nsecond the reply came more slowly, and before fixing his mind\\ndeterminedly upon it he asked himself why he felt that this was no\\nordinary commission. He could answer readily enough. First, the pay was\\ntoo large, arguing that either the packet or the placing of the packet\\nin a certain position on Mr. Gifford\\'s table was of uncommon importance\\nto this man or this woman. Secondly, the woman, though plainly and\\ninconspicuously clad, had the face of a more than ordinarily\\nunscrupulous adventuress, while her companion was one of those\\nsaturnine-faced men we sometimes meet, whose first look puts us on our\\nguard and whom, if we hope nothing from him, we instinctively shun.\\nThird, they did not look like inhabitants of the house and rooms in\\nwhich he found them. Nothing beyond the necessary articles of furniture\\nwas to be seen there; not a trunk, not an article of clothing, nor any\\nof the little things that mark a woman\\'s presence in a spot where she\\nexpects to spend a day or even an hour. Consequently they were\\ntransients and perhaps already in the act of flight. Then he was being\\nfollowed. Of this he felt sure. He had followed people himself, and\\nsomething in his own sensations assured him that his movements were\\nunder surveillance. It would, therefore, not do to show any\\nconsciousness of this, and he went on directly and as straight to his\\ngoal as his rather limited knowledge of the streets would allow. He was\\ndetermined to earn this money and to earn it without disadvantage to\\nanyone. And he thought he saw his way.\\n\\nAt the entrance of the town hall he hesitated an instant. An officer was\\nstanding in the doorway, it would be easy to call his attention to the\\npacket he held and ask him to keep his eye on it. But this might involve\\nhim with the police, and this was something, as we know, which he was\\nmore than anxious to avoid. He reverted to his first idea.\\n\\nMixing with the crowd just now hurrying to and fro through the long\\ncorridors, he reached the room designated and found it, as he had been\\nwarned he should, empty.\\n\\nApproaching the table, he laid down the packet just as he had been\\ndirected, in front of the big arm chair, and then, casting a hurried\\nlook towards the door and failing to find anyone watching him, he took\\nup a pencil lying near-by and scrawled hastily across the top of the\\npacket the word \"Suspicious.\" This he calculated would act as a warning\\nto Mr. Gifford in case there was anything wrong about the package, and\\npass as a joke with him, and even the sender, if there was not. And\\nsatisfied that he had both earned his money and done justice to his own\\napprehensions, he turned to retrace his steps. As before, the corridors\\nwere alive with hurrying men of various ages and appearance, but only\\ntwo attracted his notice. One of these was a large, intellectual-looking\\nman, who turned into the room from which he had just emerged, and the\\nother a short, fair man, with a countenance he had known from boyhood.\\nMr. Stone of Sutherlandtown was within ten paces of him, and he was as\\nwell known to the good postmaster as the postmaster was to him. Could\\nanyone have foreseen such a chance!\\n\\nTurning his back with a slow slouch, he made for a rear door he saw\\nswinging in and out before him. As he passed through he cast a quick\\nlook behind him. He had not been recognised. In great relief he rushed\\non, knocking against a man standing against one of the outside pillars.\\n\\n\"Halloo!\" shouted this man.\\n\\nSweetwater stopped. There was a tone of authority in the voice which he\\ncould not resist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVII\\n\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SCRAP OF PAPER AND THE THREE WORDS\\n\\n\\n\"What are you trying to do? Why do you fall over a man like that? Are\\nyou drunk?\"\\n\\nSweetwater drew himself up, made a sheepish bow, and muttered pantingly:\\n\\n\"Excuse me, sir. I\\'m in a hurry; I\\'m a messenger.\"\\n\\nThe man who was not in a hurry seemed disposed to keep him for a moment.\\nHe had caught sight of Sweetwater\\'s eye, which was his one remarkable\\nfeature, and he had also been impressed by that word messenger, for he\\nrepeated it with some emphasis.\\n\\n\"A messenger, eh? Are you going on a message now?\"\\n\\nSweetwater, who was anxious to get away from the vicinity of Mr. Stone,\\nshrugged his shoulders in careless denial, and was pushing on when the\\ngentleman again detained him.\\n\\n\"Do you know,\" said he, \"that I like your looks? You are not a beauty,\\nbut you look like a fellow who, if he promised to do a thing, would do\\nit and do it mighty well too.\"\\n\\nSweetwater could not restrain a certain movement of pride. He was\\nhonest, and he knew it, but the fact had not always been so openly\\nrecognised.\\n\\n\"I have just earned five dollars by doing a commission for a man,\" said\\nhe, with a straightforward look. \"See, sir. It was honestly earned.\"\\n\\nThe man, who was young and had a rather dashing but inscrutable\\nphysiognomy, glanced at the coin Sweetwater showed him and betrayed a\\ncertain disappointment.\\n\\n\"So you\\'re flush,\" said he. \"Don\\'t want another job?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, as to that,\" said Sweetwater, edging slowly down the street, \"I\\'m\\nalways ready for business. Five dollars won\\'t last forever, and,\\nbesides, I\\'m in need of new togs.\"\\n\\n\"Well, rather,\" retorted the other, carelessly following him. \"Do you\\nmind going up to Boston?\"\\n\\nBoston! Another jump toward home.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Sweetwater, hesitatingly, \"not if it\\'s made worth my while.\\nDo you want your message delivered to-day?\"\\n\\n\"At once. That is, this evening. It\\'s a task involving patience and more\\nor less shrewd judgment. Have you these qualities, my friend? One would\\nnot judge it from your clothes.\"\\n\\n\"My clothes!\" laughed Sweetwater. Life was growing very interesting all\\nat once. \"I know it takes patience to WEAR them, and as for any lack of\\njudgment I may show in their choice, I should just like to say I did not\\nchoose them myself, sir; they fell to me promiscuous-like as a sort of\\nlegacy from friends. You\\'ll see what I\\'ll do in that way if you give me\\nthe chance to earn an extra ten.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, it\\'s ten dollars you want. Well, come in here and have a drink and\\nthen we\\'ll see.\"\\n\\nThey were before a saloon house of less than humble pretensions, and as\\nhe followed the young gentleman in it struck him that it was himself\\nrather than his well-dressed and airy companion who would be expected to\\ndrink here. But he made no remark, though he intended to surprise the\\nman by his temperance.\\n\\n\"Now, look here,\" said the young gentleman, suddenly seating himself at\\na dingy table in a very dark corner and motioning Sweetwater to do the\\nsame; \"I\\'ve been looking for a man all day to go up to Boston for me,\\nand I think you\\'ll do. You know Boston?\"\\n\\nSweetwater had great command over himself, but he flushed slightly at\\nthis question, though it was so dark where he sat with this man that it\\nmade very little difference.\\n\\n\"I have been there,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Very well, then, you will go again to-night. You will arrive there\\nabout seven, you will go the rounds of some half-dozen places whose\\nnames I will give you, and when you come across a certain gentleman whom\\nI will describe to you, you will give him--\"\\n\\n\"Not a package?\" Sweetwater broke out with a certain sort of dread of a\\nrepetition of his late experience.\\n\\n\"No, this slip on which two words are written. He will want one more\\nword, but before you give it to him you must ask for your ten dollars.\\nYou\\'ll get them,\" he answered in response to a glance of suspicion from\\nSweetwater. Sweetwater was convinced that he had got hold of another\\nsuspicious job. It made him a little serious. \"Do I look like a\\ngo-between for crooks?\" he asked himself. \"I\\'m afraid I\\'m not so much of\\na success as I thought myself.\" But he said to the man before him: \"Ten\\ndollars is small pay for such business. Twenty-five would be nearer the\\nmark.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, he will give you twenty-five dollars. I forgot that ten\\ndollars was but little in advance of your expenses.\"\\n\\n\"Twenty-five if I find him, and he is in funds. What if I don\\'t?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing?\"\\n\\n\"Except your ticket; that I\\'ll give you.\"\\n\\nSweetwater did not know what to say. Like the preceding job it might be\\ninnocent and it might not. And then, he did not like going to Boston,\\nwhere he was liable to meet more than one who knew him.\\n\\n\"There is no harm in the business,\" observed the other, carelessly,\\npushing a glass of whiskey which had just been served him toward\\nSweetwater. \"I would even be willing to do it myself, if I could leave\\nNew Bedford to-night, but I can\\'t. Come! It\\'s as easy as crooking your\\nelbow.\"\\n\\n\"Just now you said it wasn\\'t,\" growled Sweetwater, drinking from his\\nglass. \"But no matter about that, go ahead, I\\'ll do it. Shall I have to\\nbuy other clothes?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d buy a new pair of trousers,\" suggested the other. \"The rest you can\\nget in Boston. You don\\'t want to be too much in evidence, you know.\"\\n\\nSweetwater agreed with. him. To attract attention was what he most\\ndreaded. \"When does the train start?\" he asked.\\n\\nThe young man told him.\\n\\n\"Well, that will give me time to buy what I want. Now, what are your\\ninstructions?\"\\n\\nThe young man gave him a memorandum, containing four addresses. \"You\\nwill find him at one of these places,\" said he. \"And now to know your\\nman when you see him. He is a large, handsome fellow, with red hair and\\na moustache like the devil. He has been hurt, and wears his left hand in\\na sling, but he can play cards, and will be found playing cards, and in\\nvery good company too. You will have to use your discretion in\\napproaching him. When once he sees this bit of paper, all will be easy.\\nHe knows what these two words mean well enough, and the third one, the\\none that is worth twenty-five dollars to you, is FREDERICK.\"\\n\\nSweetwater, who had drunk half his glass, started so at this word, which\\nwas always humming in his brain, that he knocked over his tumbler and\\nspilled what was left in it.\\n\\n\"I hope I won\\'t forget that word,\" he remarked, in a careless tone,\\nintended to carry off his momentary show of feeling.\\n\\n\"If you do, then don\\'t expect the twenty-five dollars,\" retorted the\\nother, finishing his own glass, but not offering to renew Sweetwater\\'s.\\n\\nSweetwater laughed, said he thought he could trust his memory, and rose.\\nIn a half-hour he was at the depot, and in another fifteen minutes\\nspeeding out of New Bedford on his way to Boston.\\n\\nHe had had but one anxiety--that Mr. Stone might be going up to Boston\\ntoo. But, once relieved of this apprehension, he settled back, and for\\nthe first time in twelve hours had a minute in which to ask himself who\\nhe was, and what he was about. Adventure had followed so fast upon\\nadventure that he was in a more or less dazed condition, and felt as\\nlittle capable of connecting event with event as if he had been asked to\\nrecall the changing pictures of a kaleidoscope. That affair of the\\npacket, now, was it or was it not serious, and would he ever know what\\nit meant or how it turned out?\\n\\nLike a child who had been given a pebble, and told to throw it over the\\nwall, he had thrown and run, giving a shout of warning, it is true, but\\nnot knowing, nor ever likely to know, where the stone had fallen, or\\nwhat it was meant to do. Then this new commission on which he was\\nbent--was it in any way connected with the other, or merely the odd\\nresult of his being in the right place at the right moment? He was\\ninclined to think the latter. And yet how odd it was that one doubtful\\nerrand should be followed by another, in a town no larger than New\\nBedford, forcing him from scene to scene, till he found himself speeding\\ntoward the city he least desired to enter, and from which he had the\\nmost to fear!\\n\\nBut brooding over a case like this brings small comfort. He felt that he\\nhad been juggled with, but he neither knew by whose hand nor in what\\ncause. If the hand was that of Providence, why he had only to go on\\nfollowing the beck of the moment, while if it was that of Fate, the very\\nuselessness of struggling with it was apparent at once. Poor reasoning,\\nperhaps, but no other offered, and satisfied that whatever came his\\nintentions were above question, he settled himself at last for a nap, of\\nwhich he certainly stood in good need. When he awoke he was in Boston.\\n\\nThe first thing he did was to show his list of addresses and inquire\\ninto what quarter they would lead him. To his surprise he found it to be\\nthe fashionable quarter. Two of them were names of well-known\\nclub-houses, a third that of a first-class restaurant, and the fourth\\nthat of a private house on Commonwealth Avenue. Heigho! and he was\\ndressed like a tramp, or nearly so!\\n\\n\"Queer messenger, I, for such kind of work,\" thought he. \"I wonder why\\nhe lighted on such a rough-looking customer. He must have had his\\nreasons. I wonder if he wished the errand to fail. He bore himself very\\nnonchalantly at the depot. When I last saw him his face and attitude\\nwere those of a totally unconcerned man. Have I been sent on a fool\\'s\\nchase after all?\"\\n\\nThe absurdity of this conclusion struck him, however, as he reasoned:\\n\"Why, then, should he have paid my fare? Not as a benefit to me, of\\ncourse, but for his own ends, whatever they might be. Let us see, then,\\nwhat those ends are. So now for the gentleman of the red hair who plays\\ncards with one arm in a sling.\"\\n\\nHe thought that he might get entrance into the club-houses easily\\nenough. He possessed a certain amount of insinuation when necessity\\nrequired, and, if hard-featured, had a good expression which in\\nunprejudiced minds defied criticism. Of porters and doorkeepers he was\\nnot afraid, and these were the men he must first encounter.\\n\\nAt the first club-house he succeeded easily enough in getting word with\\nthe man waiting in the large hall, and before many minutes learned that\\nthe object of his search was not to be found there that evening. He also\\nlearned his name, which was a great step towards the success of his\\nembassy. It was Wattles, Captain Wattles, a marked man evidently, even\\nin this exclusive and aristocratic club.\\n\\nArmed with this new knowledge, he made his way to the second building of\\nthe kind and boldly demanded speech with Captain Wattles. But Captain\\nWattles had not yet arrived and he went out again this time to look him\\nup at the restaurant.\\n\\nHe was not there. As Sweetwater was going out two gentlemen came in, one\\nof whom said to the other in passing:\\n\\n\"Sick, do you say? I thought Wattles was made of iron.\"\\n\\n\"So he was,\" returned the other, \"before that accident to his arm. Now\\nthe least thing upsets him. He\\'s down at Haberstow\\'s.\"\\n\\nThat was all; the door was swung to between them. Sweetwater had\\nreceived his clew, but what a clew! Haberstow\\'s? Where was that?\\n\\nThinking the bold course the best one, he re-entered the restaurant and\\napproached the gentlemen he had just seen enter.\\n\\n\"I heard you speak the name of Captain Wattles,\" said he. \"I am hunting\\nfor Captain Wattles. Can you tell me where he is?\"\\n\\nHe soon saw that he had struck the wrong men for information. They not\\nonly refused to answer him, but treated him with open disdain. Unwilling\\nto lose time, he left them, and having no other resource, hastened to\\nthe last place mentioned on his list.\\n\\nIt was now late, too late to enter a private house under ordinary\\ncircumstances, but this house was lighted up, and a carriage stood in\\nfront of it; so he had the courage to run up the steps and consult the\\nlarge door-plate visible from the sidewalk. It read thus:\\n\\nHABERSTOW.\\n\\nFortune had favoured him better than he expected.\\n\\nHe hesitated a moment, then decided to ring the bell. But before he had\\ndone so, the door opened and an old gentleman appeared seeing a younger\\nman out. The latter had his arm in a sling, and bore himself with a\\nfierceness that made his appearance somewhat alarming; the other seemed\\nto be in an irate state of mind.\\n\\n\"No apologies!\" the former was saying. \"I don\\'t mind the night air; I\\'m\\nnot so ill as that. When I\\'m myself again we\\'ll have a little more talk.\\nMy compliments to your daughter, sir. I wish you a very good evening, or\\nrather night.\"\\n\\nThe old gentleman bowed, and as he did so Sweetwater caught a glimpse\\n(it was the shortest glimpse in the world) of a sweet face beaming from\\na doorway far down the hall. There was pain in it and a yearning anxiety\\nthat made it very beautiful; then it vanished, and the old gentleman,\\nuttering some few sarcastic words, closed the door, and Sweetwater found\\nhimself alone and in darkness.\\n\\nThe kaleidoscope had been given another turn.\\n\\nDashing down the stoop, he came upon the gentleman who had preceded him,\\njust as he was seating himself in the carriage.\\n\\n\"Pardon me,\" he gasped, as the driver caught up the reins; \"you have\\nforgotten something.\" Then, as Captain Wattles looked hastily out, \"You\\nhave forgotten me.\"\\n\\nThe oath that rang out from under that twitching red moustache was\\nsomething to startle even him. But he clung to the carriage window and\\npresently managed to say:\\n\\n\"A messenger, sir, from New Bedford. I have been on the hunt for you for\\ntwo hours. It won\\'t keep, sir, for more than a half-hour longer. Where\\nshall I find you during that time?\"\\n\\nCaptain Wattles, on whom the name New Bedford seemed to have made some\\nimpression, pointed up at the coachman\\'s box with a growl, in which\\ncommand mingled strangely with menace. Then he threw himself back.\\nEvidently the captain was not in very good humour.\\n\\nSweetwater, taking this as an order to seat himself beside the driver,\\ndid so, and the carriage drove off. It went at a rapid pace, and before\\nhe had time to propound more than a question or two to the coachman, it\\nstopped before a large apartment-house in a brilliantly lighted street.\\n\\nCaptain Wattles got out, and Sweetwater followed him. The former, who\\nseemed to have forgotten Sweetwater, walked past him and entered the\\nbuilding with a stride and swing that made the plain, lean,\\ninsignificant-looking messenger behind him feel smaller than ever.\\nIndeed, he had never felt so small, for not only was the captain a man\\nof superb proportions and conspicuous bearing, but he possessed, in\\nspite of his fiery hair and fierce moustache, that _beauté de diable_\\nwhich is at once threatening and imposing. Added to this, he was angry\\nand so absorbed in his own thoughts that he would be very apt to visit\\npunishment of no light character upon anyone who interfered with him. A\\npleasing prospect for Sweetwater, who, however, kept on with the dogged\\ndetermination of his character up the first flight of stairs and then up\\nanother till they stopped, Captain Wattles first and afterwards his\\nhumble follower, before a small door into which the captain endeavoured\\nto fit a key. The oaths which followed his failure to do this were not\\nvery encouraging to the man behind, nor was the kick which he gave the\\ndoor after the second more successful attempt calculated to act in a\\nvery reassuring way upon anyone whose future pay for a doubtful task\\nrested upon this man\\'s good nature.\\n\\nThe darkness which met them both on the threshold of this now open room\\nwas speedily relieved by a burst of electric light, that flooded the\\nwhole apartment and brought out the captain\\'s swaggering form and\\nthreatening features with startling distinctness. He had thrown off his\\nhat and was relieving himself of a cloak in a furious way that caused\\nSweetwater to shrink back, and, as the French say, efface himself as\\nmuch as possible behind a clothes-tree standing near the door. That the\\ncaptain had entirely forgotten him was evident, and for the present\\nmoment that gentleman was too angry to care or even notice if a dozen\\nmen stood at the door. As he was talking all this time, or rather\\njerking out sharp sentences, as men do when in a towering rage,\\nSweetwater was glad to be left unnoticed, for much can be gathered from\\nscattered sentences, especially when a man is in too reckless a frame of\\nmind to weigh them. He, therefore, made but little movement and\\nlistened; and these are some of the ejaculations and scraps of talk he\\nheard:\\n\\n\"The old purse-proud fool! Honoured by my friendship, but not ready to\\naccept me as his daughter\\'s suitor! As if I would lounge away hours that\\nmean dollars to me in his stiff old drawing-room, just to hear his\\neverlasting drone about stocks up and stocks down, and politics gone all\\nwrong. He has heard that I play cards, and--How pretty she looked! I\\nbelieve I half like that girl, and when I think she has a million in her\\nown right--Damn it, if I cannot win her openly and with papa\\'s consent,\\nI will carry her off with only her own. She\\'s worth the effort, doubly\\nworth it, and when I have her and her money--Eh! Who are you?\"\\n\\nHe had seen Sweetwater at last, which was not strange, seeing that he\\nhad turned his way, and was within two feet of him.\\n\\n\"What are you doing here, and who let you in? Get out, or--\"\\n\\n\"A message, Captain Wattles! A message from New Bedford. You have\\nforgotten, sir; you bade me follow you.\"\\n\\nIt was curious to see the menace slowly die out of the face of this\\nflushed and angry man as he met Sweetwater\\'s calm eye and unabashed\\nfront, and noticed, as he had not done at first, the slip of paper which\\nthe latter resolutely held out.\\n\\n\"New Bedford; ah, from Campbell, I take it. Let me see!\" And the hand\\nwhich had shook with rage now trembled with a very different sort of\\nemotion as he took the slip, cast his eyes over it, and then looked back\\nat Sweetwater.\\n\\nNow, Sweetwater knew the two words written on that paper. He could see\\nout of the back of his head at times, and he had been able to make out\\nthese words when the man in New Bedford was writing them.\\n\\n\"Happenings; Afghanistan,\" with the figures 2000 after the latter.\\n\\nNot much sense in them singly or in conjunction, but the captain,\\nmuttering them over to himself, consulted a little book which he took\\nfrom his breast pocket and found, or seemed to, a clew to their meaning.\\nIt could only have been a partial one, however, for in another instant\\nhe turned on Sweetwater with a sour look and a thundering oath.\\n\\n\"Is this all?\" he shouted. \"Does he call this a complete message?\"\\n\\n\"There is another word,\" returned Sweetwater, \"which he bade me give you\\nby word of mouth; but that word don\\'t go for nothing. It\\'s worth just\\ntwenty-five dollars. I\\'ve earned it, sir. I came up from New Bedford on\\npurpose to deliver it to you.\"\\n\\nSweetwater expected a blow, but he only got a stare.\\n\\n\"Twenty-five dollars,\" muttered the captain. \"Well, it\\'s fortunate that\\nI have them. And who are you?\" he asked. \"Not one of Campbell\\'s\\npick-ups, surely?\"\\n\\n\"I am a confidential messenger,\" smiled Sweetwater, amused against his\\nwill at finding a name for himself. \"I carry messages and execute\\ncommissions that require more or less discretion in the handling. I am\\npaid well. Twenty-five dollars is the price of this job.\"\\n\\n\"So you have had the honour of informing me before,\" blustered the other\\nwith an attempt to hide some serious emotion. \"Why, man, what do you\\nfear? Don\\'t you see I\\'m hurt? You could knock me over with a feather if\\nyou touched my game arm.\"\\n\\n\"Twenty-five dollars,\" repeated Sweetwater.\\n\\nThe captain grew angrier. \"Dash it! aren\\'t you going to have them?\\nWhat\\'s the word?\"\\n\\nBut Sweetwater wasn\\'t going to be caught by chaff.\\n\\n\"C. O. D.,\" he insisted firmly, standing his ground, though certain that\\nthe blow would now fall. But no, the captain laughed, and tugging away\\nwith his one free hand at his pocket, he brought out a pocket-book, from\\nwhich he managed deftly enough to draw out three bills. \"There,\" said\\nhe, laying them on the table, but keeping one long vigorous finger on\\nthem. \"Now, the word.\"\\n\\nSweetwater laid his own hand on the bills.\\n\\n\"Frederick,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said the other thoughtfully, lifting his finger and proceeding to\\nstride up and down the room. \"He\\'s a stiff one. What he says, he will\\ndo. Two thousand dollars! and soon, too, I warrant. Well, I\\'m in a devil\\nof a fix at last.\" He had again forgotten the presence of Sweetwater.\\n\\nSuddenly he turned or rather stopped. His eye was on the messenger, but\\nhe did not even see him. \"One Frederick must offset the other,\" he\\ncried. \"It\\'s the only loophole out,\" and he threw himself into a chair\\nfrom which he immediately sprang up again with a yell. He had hurt his\\nwounded arm.\\n\\nPandemonium reigned in that small room for a minute, then his eye fell\\nagain on Sweetwater, who, under the fascination of the spectacle offered\\nhim, had only just succeeded in finding the knob of the door. This time\\nthere was recognition in his look.\\n\\n\"Wait!\" he cried. \"I may have use for you too. Confidential messengers\\nare hard to come by, and one that Campbell would employ must be all\\nright. Sit down there! I\\'ll talk to you when I\\'m ready.\"\\n\\nSweetwater was not slow in obeying this command. Business was booming\\nwith him. Besides, the name of Frederick acted like a charm upon him.\\nThere seemed to be so many Fredericks in the world, and one of them lay\\nin such a curious way near his heart.\\n\\nMeanwhile the captain reseated himself, but more carefully. He had a\\nplan or method of procedure to think out, or so it seemed, for he sat a\\nlong time in rigid immobility, with only the scowl of perplexity or\\nill-temper on his brow to show the nature of his thoughts. Then he drew\\na sheet of paper toward him, and began to write a letter. He was so\\nabsorbed over this letter and the manipulation of it, having but one\\nhand to work with, that Sweetwater determined upon a hazardous stroke.\\nThe little book which the captain had consulted, and which had\\nundoubtedly furnished him with a key to those two incongruous words, lay\\non the floor not far from him, having been flung from its owner\\'s hand\\nduring the moments of passion and suffering I have above mentioned. To\\nreach this book with his foot, to draw it toward him, and, finally, to\\nget hold of it with his hand, was not difficult for one who aspired to\\nbe a detective, and had already done some good work in that direction.\\nBut it was harder to turn the leaves and find the words he sought\\nwithout attracting the attention of his fierce companion. He, however,\\nsucceeded in doing this at last, the long list of words he found on\\nevery page being arranged alphabetically. It was a private code for\\ntelegraphic or cable messages, and he soon found that \"Happenings\"\\nmeant: \"Our little game discovered; play straight until I give you the\\nwink.\" And that \"Afghanistan\" stood for: \"Hush money.\" As the latter was\\nfollowed by the figures I have mentioned, the purport of the message\\nneeded no explanation, but the word \"Frederick\" did. So he searched for\\nthat, only to find that it was not in the book. There was but one\\nconclusion to draw. This name was perfectly well known between them, and\\nwas that of the person, no doubt, who laid claim to the two thousand\\ndollars.\\n\\nSatisfied at holding this clew to the riddle, he dropped the book again\\nat his side and skilfully kicked it far out into the room. Captain\\nWattles had seen nothing. He was a man who took in only one thing at a\\ntime.\\n\\nThe penning of that letter went on laboriously. It took so long that\\nSweetwater dozed, or pretended to, and when it was at last done, the\\nclock on the mantelpiece had struck two.\\n\\n\"Halloo there, now!\" suddenly shouted the captain, turning on the\\nmessenger. \"Are you ready for another journey?\"\\n\\n\"That depends,\" smiled Sweetwater, rising sleepily and advancing.\\n\"Haven\\'t got over the last one yet, and would rather sleep than start\\nout again.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you want pay? Well, you\\'ll get that fast enough if you succeed in\\nyour mission. This letter\" he shook it with an impatient hand--\"should\\nbe worth two thousand five hundred dollars to me. If you bring me back\\nthat money or its equivalent within twenty-four hours, I will give you a\\nclean hundred of it. Good enough pay, I take it, for five hours\\'\\njourney. Better than sleep, eh? Besides, you can doze on the cars.\"\\n\\nSweetwater agreed with him in all these assertions. Putting on his cap,\\nhe reached for the letter. He didn\\'t like being made an instrument for\\nblackmail, but he was curious to see to whom he was about to be sent.\\nBut the captain had grown suddenly wary.\\n\\n\"This is not a letter to be dropped in the mailbox,\" said he. \"You\\nbrought me a line here whose prompt delivery has prevented me from\\nmaking a fool of myself to-night. You must do as much with this one. It\\nis to be carried to its destination by yourself, given to the person\\nwhose name you will find written on it, and the answer brought back\\nbefore you sleep, mind you, unless you snatch a wink or so on the cars.\\nThat it is night need not disturb you. It will be daylight before you\\narrive at the place to which this is addressed, and if you cannot get\\ninto the house at so early an hour, whistle three times like\\nthis--listen and one of the windows will presently fly up. You have had\\nno trouble finding me; you\\'ll have no trouble finding him. When you\\nreturn, hunt me up as you did to-night. Only you need not trouble\\nyourself to look for me at Haberstow\\'s,\" he added under his breath in a\\ntone that was no doubt highly satisfactory to himself. \"I shall not be\\nthere. And now, off with you!\" he shouted. \"You\\'ve your hundred dollars\\nto make before daylight, and it\\'s already after two.\"\\n\\nSweetwater, who had stolen a glimpse at the superscription on the letter\\nhe held, stumbled as he went out of the door. It was directed, as he had\\nexpected, to a Frederick, probably to the second one of whom Captain\\nWattles had spoken, but not, as he had expected, to a stranger. The name\\non the letter was Frederick Sutherland, and the place of his destination\\nwas Sutherlandtown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVIII\\n\\n\"WHO ARE YOU?\"\\n\\n\\nThe round had come full circle. By various chances and a train of\\ncircumstances for which he could not account, he had been turned from\\nhis first intention and was being brought back stage by stage to the\\nvery spot he had thought it his duty to fly from. Was this fate? He\\nbegan to think so, and no longer so much as dreamed of struggling\\nagainst it. But he felt very much dazed, and walked away through the now\\npartially deserted streets with an odd sense of failure that was only\\ncompensated by the hope he now cherished of seeing his mother again, and\\nbeing once more Caleb Sweetwater of Sutherlandtown.\\n\\nHe was clearer, however, after a few blocks of rapid walking, and then\\nhe began to wonder over the contents of the letter he held, and how they\\nwould affect its recipient. Was it a new danger he was bringing him?\\nInstead of aiding Mr. Sutherland in keeping his dangerous secret, was he\\ndestined to bring disgrace upon him, not only by his testimony before\\nthe coroner, but by means of this letter, which, whatever it contained,\\ncertainly could not bode good to the man from whom it was designed to\\nwrest two thousand five hundred dollars?\\n\\nThe fear that he was destined to do so grew upon him rapidly, and the\\ntemptation to open the letter and make himself master of its contents\\nbefore leaving town at last became so strong that his sense of honour\\npaled before it, and he made up his mind that before he ventured into\\nthe precincts of Sutherlandtown he would know just what sort of a\\nbombshell he was carrying into the Sutherland family. To do this he\\nstopped at the first respectable lodging-house he encountered and hired\\na room. Calling for hot water \"piping hot,\" he told them--he subjected\\nthe letter to the effects of steam and presently had it open. He was not\\ndisappointed in its contents, save that they were even more dangerous\\nthan he had anticipated. Captain Wattles was an old crony of Frederick\\'s\\nand knew his record better than anyone else in the world. From this fact\\nand the added one that Frederick had stood in special need of money at\\nthe time of Agatha Webb\\'s murder, the writer had no hesitation in\\nbelieving him guilty of the crime which opened his way to a fortune, and\\nthough under ordinary circumstances he would, as his friend Frederick\\nalready knew, be perfectly willing to keep his opinions to himself, he\\nwas just now under the same necessity for money that Frederick had been\\nat that fatal time, and must therefore see the colour of two thousand\\nfive hundred dollars before the day was out if Frederick desired to have\\nhis name kept out of the Boston papers. That it had been kept out up to\\nthis time argued that the crime had been well enough hidden to make the\\nalternative thus offered an important one.\\n\\nThere was no signature.\\n\\nSweetwater, affected to an extent he little expected, resealed the\\nletter, made his excuses to the landlord, and left the house. Now he\\ncould see why he had not been allowed to make his useless sacrifice.\\nAnother man than himself suspected Frederick, and by a word could\\nprecipitate the doom he already saw hung too low above the devoted head\\nof Mr. Sutherland\\'s son to be averted.\\n\\n\"Yet I\\'ll attempt that too,\" burst impetuously from his lips. \"If I\\nfail, I can but go back with a knowledge of this added danger. If I\\nsucceed, why I must still go back. From some persons and from some\\ncomplications it is useless to attempt flight.\"\\n\\nReturning to the club-house he had first entered in his search for\\nCaptain Wattles, he asked if that gentleman had yet come in. This time\\nhe was answered by an affirmative, though he might almost as well have\\nnot been, for the captain was playing cards in a private room and would\\nnot submit to any interruption.\\n\\n\"He will submit to mine,\" retorted Sweetwater to the man who had told\\nhim this. \"Or wait; hand him back this letter and say that the messenger\\nrefuses to deliver it.\"\\n\\nThis brought the captain out, as he had fully expected it would.\\n\\n\"Why, what--\" began that gentleman in a furious rage.\\n\\nBut Sweetwater, laying his hand on the arm he knew to be so sensitive,\\nrose on tiptoe and managed to whisper in the angry man\\'s ear:\\n\\n\"You are a card-sharp, and it will be easy enough to ruin you. Threaten\\nFrederick Sutherland and in two weeks you will be boycotted by every\\nclub in this city. Twenty-five hundred dollars won\\'t pay you for that.\"\\n\\nThis from a nondescript fellow with no grains of a gentleman about him\\nin form, feature, or apparel! The captain stared nonplussed, too much\\ntaken aback to be even angry.\\n\\nSuddenly he cried:\\n\\n\"How do you know all this? How do you know what is or is not in the\\nletter I gave you?\"\\n\\nSweetwater, with a shrug that in its quiet significance seemed to make\\nhim at once the equal of his interrogator, quietly pressed the quivering\\nlimb under his hand and calmly replied:\\n\\n\"I know because I have read it. Before putting my head in the lion\\'s\\nmouth, I make it a point to count his teeth,\" and lifting his hand, he\\ndrew back, leaving the captain reeling.\\n\\n\"What is your name? Who are you?\" shouted out Wattles as Sweetwater was\\ndrawing off.\\n\\nIt was the third time he had been asked that question within twenty-four\\nhours, but not before with this telling emphasis. \"Who are you, I say,\\nand what can you do to me--?\"\\n\\n\"I am--But that is an insignificant detail unworthy of your curiosity.\\nAs to what I can do, wait and see. But first burn that letter.\"\\n\\nAnd turning his back he fled out of the building, followed by oaths\\nwhich, if not loud, were certainly deep and very far-reaching.\\n\\nIt was the first time Captain Wattles had met his match in audacity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIX\\n\\nHOME AGAIN\\n\\n\\nOn his way to the depot, Sweetwater went into the Herald office and\\nbought a morning paper. At the station he opened it. There was one\\ncolumn devoted to the wreck of the Hesper, and a whole half-page to the\\nproceedings of the third day\\'s inquiry into the cause and manner of\\nAgatha Webb\\'s death. Merely noting that his name was mentioned among the\\nlost, in the first article, he began to read the latter with justifiable\\neagerness. The assurance given in Captain Wattles\\'s letter was true. No\\ndirect suspicion had as yet fallen on Frederick. As the lover of Amabel\\nPage, his name was necessarily mentioned, but neither in the account of\\nthe inquest nor in the editorials on the subject could he find any proof\\nthat either the public or police had got hold of the great idea that he\\nwas the man who had preceded Amabel to Agatha\\'s cottage. Relieved on\\nthis score, Sweetwater entered more fully into the particulars, and\\nfound that though the jury had sat three days, very little more had come\\nto light than was known on the morning he made that bold dash into the\\nHesper. Most of the witnesses had given in their testimony, Amabel\\'s\\nbeing the chief, and though no open accusation had been made, it was\\nevident from the trend of the questions put to the latter that Amabel\\'s\\nconnection with the affair was looked upon as criminal and as placing\\nher in a very suspicious light. Her replies, however, as once before,\\nunder a similar but less formal examination, failed to convey any\\nrecognition on her part either of this suspicion or of her own position;\\nyet they were not exactly frank, and Sweetwater saw, or thought he saw\\n(naturally failing to have a key to the situation), that she was still\\nworking upon her old plan of saving both herself and Frederick, by\\nthrowing whatever suspicion her words might raise upon the deceased\\nZabel. He did not know, and perhaps it was just as well that he did not\\nat this especial juncture, that she was only biding her time--now very\\nnearly at hand--and that instead of loving Frederick, she hated him, and\\nwas determined upon his destruction. Reading, as a final clause, that\\nMr. Sutherland was expected to testify soon in explanation of his\\nposition as executor of Mrs. Webb\\'s will, Sweetwater grew very serious,\\nand, while no change took place in his mind as to his present duty, he\\ndecided that his return must be as unobtrusive as possible, and his only\\ntoo timely reappearance on the scene of the inquiry kept secret till Mr.\\nSutherland had given his evidence and retired from under the eyes of his\\nexcited fellow-citizens.\\n\\n\"The sight of me might unnerve him,\" was Sweetwater\\'s thought,\\n\"precipitating the very catastrophe we dread. One look, one word on his\\npart indicative of his inner apprehensions that his son had a hand in\\nthe crime which has so benefited him, and nothing can save Frederick\\nfrom the charge of murder. Not Knapp\\'s skill, my silence, or Amabel\\'s\\nfinesse. The young man will be lost.\"\\n\\nHe did not know, as we do, that Amabel\\'s finesse was devoted to winning\\na husband for herself, and that, in the event of failure, the action she\\nthreatened against her quondam lover would be precipitated that very day\\nat the moment when the clock struck twelve.\\n\\n       .       .       .       .       .       .\\n\\nSweetwater arrived home by the way of Portchester. He had seen one or\\ntwo persons he knew, but, so far, had himself escaped recognition. The\\nmorning light was dimly breaking when he strode into the outskirts of\\nSutherlandtown and began to descend the hill. As he passed Mr.\\nHalliday\\'s house he looked up, and was astonished to see a light burning\\nin one deeply embowered window. Alas! he did not know how early one\\nanxious heart woke during those troublous days. The Sutherland house was\\ndark, but as he crept very close under its overhanging eaves he heard a\\ndeep sigh uttered over his head, and knew that someone was up here also\\nin anxious expectation of a day that was destined to hold more than even\\nhe anticipated.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the sea grew rosy, and the mother\\'s cottage was as yet far\\noff. Hurrying on, he came at last under the eye of more than one of the\\nearly risers of Sutherlandtown.\\n\\n\"What, Sweetwater! Alive and well!\"\\n\\n\"Hey, Sweetwater, we thought you were lost on the Hesper!\"\\n\\n\"Halloo! Home in time to see the pretty Amabel arrested?\" Phrases like\\nthese met him at more than one corner; but he eluded them all, stopping\\nonly to put one hesitating question. Was his mother well?\\n\\nHome fears had made themselves felt with his near approach to that\\nhumble cottage door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK III\\n\\nHAD BATSY LIVED!\\n\\n\\nXXX\\n\\nWHAT FOLLOWED THE STRIKING OF THE CLOCK\\n\\n\\nIt was the last day of the inquest, and to many it bade fair to be the\\nleast interesting. All the witnesses who had anything to say had long\\nago given in their testimony, and when at or near noon Sweetwater slid\\ninto the inconspicuous seat he had succeeded in obtaining near the\\ncoroner, it was to find in two faces only any signs of the eagerness and\\nexpectancy which filled his own breast to suffocation. But as these\\nfaces were those of Agnes Halliday and Amabel Page, he soon recognised\\nthat his own judgment was not at fault, and that notwithstanding outward\\nappearances and the languid interest shown in the now lagging\\nproceedings, the moment presaged an event full of unseen but vital\\nconsequence.\\n\\nFrederick was not visible in the great hall; but that he was near at\\nhand soon became evident from the change Sweetwater now saw in Amabel.\\nFor while she had hitherto sat under the universal gaze with only the\\nfaint smile of conscious beauty on her inscrutable features, she roused\\nas the hands of the clock moved toward noon, and glanced at the great\\ndoor of entrance with an evil expectancy that startled even Sweetwater,\\nso little had he really understood the nature of the passions labouring\\nin that venomous breast.\\n\\nNext moment the door opened, and Frederick and his father came in. The\\nair of triumphant satisfaction with which Amabel sank back into her seat\\nwas as marked in its character as her previous suspense. What did it\\nmean? Sweetwater, noting it, and the vivid contrast it offered to\\nFrederick\\'s air of depression, felt that his return had been well timed.\\n\\nMr. Sutherland was looking very feeble. As he took the chair offered\\nhim, the change in his appearance was apparent to all who knew him, and\\nthere were few there who did not know him. And, startled by these\\nevidences of suffering which they could not understand and feared to\\ninterpret even to themselves, more than one devoted friend stole uneasy\\nglances at Frederick to see if he too were under the cloud which seemed\\nto envelop his father almost beyond recognition.\\n\\nBut Frederick was looking at Amabel, and his erect head and determined\\naspect made him a conspicuous figure in the room. She who had called up\\nthis expression, and alone comprehended it fully, smiled as she met his\\neye, with that curious slow dipping of her dimples which had more than\\nonce confounded the coroner, and rendered her at once the admiration and\\nabhorrence of the crowd who for so long a time had had the opportunity\\nof watching her.\\n\\nFrederick, to whom this smile conveyed a last hope as well as a last\\nthreat, looked away as soon as possible, but not before her eyes had\\nfallen in their old inquiring way to his hands, from which he had\\nremoved the ring which up to this hour he had invariably worn on his\\nthird finger. In this glance of hers and this action of his began the\\nstruggle that was to make that day memorable in many hearts.\\n\\nAfter the first stir occasioned by the entrance of two such important\\npersons the crowd settled back into its old quietude under the coroner\\'s\\nhand. A tedious witness was having his slow say, and to him a full\\nattention was being given in the hope that some real enlightenment would\\ncome at last to settle the questions which had been raised by Amabel\\'s\\nincomplete and unsatisfactory testimony. But no man can furnish what he\\ndoes not possess, and the few final minutes before noon passed by\\nwithout any addition being made to the facts which had already been\\npresented for general consideration.\\n\\nAs the witness sat down the clock began to strike. As the slow,\\nhesitating strokes rang out, Sweetwater saw Frederick yield to a sudden\\nbut most profound emotion. The old fear, which we understand, if\\nSweetwater did not, had again seized the victim of Amabel\\'s ambition,\\nand under her eye, which was blazing full upon him now with a fell and\\nsteady purpose, he found his right hand stealing toward the left in the\\nsignificant action she expected. Better to yield than fall headlong into\\nthe pit one word of hers would open. He had not meant to yield, but now\\nthat the moment had come, now that he must at once and forever choose\\nbetween a course that led simply to personal unhappiness and one that\\ninvolved not only himself, but those dearest to him, in disgrace and\\nsorrow, he felt himself weaken to the point of clutching at whatever\\nwould save him from the consequences of confession. Moral strength and\\nthat tenacity of purpose which only comes from years of self-control\\nwere too lately awakened in his breast to sustain him now. As stroke\\nafter stroke fell on the ear, he felt himself yielding beyond recovery,\\nand had almost touched his finger in the significant action of assent\\nwhich Amabel awaited with breathless expectation, when--was it miracle\\nor only the suggestion of his better nature?--the memory of a face full\\nof holy pleading rose from the past before his eyes and with an inner\\ncry of \"Mother!\" he flung his hand out and clutched his father\\'s arm in\\na way to break the charm of his own dread and end forever the effects of\\nthe intolerable fascination that was working upon him. Next minute the\\nlast stroke of noon rang out, and the hour was up which Amabel had set\\nas the limit of her silence.\\n\\nA pause, which to their two hearts if to no others seemed strangely\\nappropriate, followed the cessation of these sounds, then the witness\\nwas dismissed, and Amabel, taking advantage of the movement, was about\\nto lean toward Mr. Courtney, when Frederick, leaping with a bound to his\\nfeet, drew all eyes towards himself with the cry:\\n\\n\"Let me be put on my oath. I have testimony to give of the utmost\\nimportance in this case.\"\\n\\nThe coroner was astounded; everyone was astounded. No one had expected\\nanything from him, and instinctively every eye turned towards Amabel to\\nsee how she was affected by his action.\\n\\nStrangely, evidently, for the look with which she settled back in her\\nseat was one which no one who saw it ever forgot, though it conveyed no\\nhint of her real feelings, which were somewhat chaotic.\\n\\nFrederick, who had forgotten her now that he had made up his mind to\\nspeak, waited for the coroner\\'s reply.\\n\\n\"If you have testimony,\" said that gentleman after exchanging a few\\nhurried words with Mr. Courtney and the surprised Knapp, \"you can do no\\nbetter than give it to us at once. Mr. Frederick Sutherland, will you\\ntake the stand?\"\\n\\nWith a noble air from which all hesitation had vanished, Frederick\\nstarted towards the place indicated, but stopped before he had taken a\\nhalf-dozen steps and glanced back at his father, who was visibly\\nsuccumbing under this last shock.\\n\\n\"Go!\" he whispered, but in so thrilling a tone it was heard to the\\nremotest corner of the room. \"Spare me the anguish of saying what I have\\nto say in your presence. I could not bear it. You could not bear it.\\nLater, if you will wait for me in one of these rooms, I will repeat my\\ntale in your ears, but go now. It is my last entreaty.\"\\n\\nThere was a silence; no one ventured a dissent, no one so much as made a\\ngesture of disapproval. Then Mr. Sutherland struggled to his feet, cast\\none last look around him, and disappeared through a door which had\\nopened like magic before him. Then and not till then did Frederick move\\nforward.\\n\\nThe moment was intense. The coroner seemed to share the universal\\nexcitement, for his first question was a leading one and brought out\\nthis startling admission:\\n\\n\"I have obtruded myself into this inquiry and now ask to be heard by\\nthis jury, because no man knows more than I do of the manner and cause\\nof Agatha Webb\\'s death. This you will believe when I tell you that _I_\\nwas the person Miss Page followed into Mrs. Webb\\'s house and whom she\\nheard descend the stairs during the moment she crouched behind the\\nfigure of the sleeping Philemon.\"\\n\\nIt was more, infinitely more, than anyone there had expected. It was not\\nonly an acknowledgment but a confession, and the shock, the surprise,\\nthe alarm, which it occasioned even to those who had never had much\\nconfidence in this young man\\'s virtue, was almost appalling in its\\nintensity. Had it not been for the consciousness of Mr. Sutherland\\'s\\nnear presence the feeling would have risen to outbreak; and many voices\\nwere held in subjection by the remembrance of this venerated man\\'s last\\nlook, that otherwise would have made themselves heard in despite of the\\nrestrictions of the place and the authority of the police.\\n\\nTo Frederick it was a moment of immeasurable grief and humiliation. On\\nevery face, in every shrinking form, in subdued murmurs and open cries,\\nhe read instant and complete condemnation, and yet in all his life from\\nboyhood up to this hour, never had he been so worthy of their esteem and\\nconsideration. But though he felt the iron enter his soul, he did not\\nlose his determined attitude. He had observed a change in Amabel and a\\nchange in Agnes, and if only to disappoint the vile triumph of the one\\nand raise again the drooping courage of the other, he withstood the\\nclamour and began speaking again, before the coroner had been able to\\nfully restore quiet.\\n\\n\"I know,\" said he, \"what this acknowledgment must convey to the minds of\\nthe jury and people here assembled. But if anyone who listens to me\\nthinks me guilty of the death I was so unfortunate as to have witnessed,\\nhe will be doing me a wrong which Agatha Webb would be the first to\\ncondemn. Dr. Talbot, and you, gentlemen of the jury, in the face of God\\nand man, I here declare that Mrs. Webb, in my presence and before my\\neyes, gave to herself the blow which has robbed us all of a most\\nvaluable life. She was not murdered.\"\\n\\nIt was a solemn assertion, but it failed to convince the crowd before\\nhim. As by one impulse men and women broke into a tumult. Mr. Sutherland\\nwas forgotten and cries of \"Never! She was too good! It\\'s all calumny! A\\nwretched lie!\" broke in unrestrained excitement from every part of the\\nlarge room. In vain the coroner smote with his gavel, in vain the local\\npolice endeavoured to restore order; the tide was up and over-swept\\neverything for an instant till silence was suddenly restored by the\\nsight of Amabel smoothing out the folds of her crisp white frock with an\\nincredulous, almost insulting, smile that at once fixed attention again\\non Frederick. He seized the occasion and spoke up in a tone of great\\nresolve.\\n\\n\"I have made an assertion,\" said he, \"before God and before this jury.\\nTo make it seem a credible one I shall have to tell my own story from\\nthe beginning. Am I allowed to do so, Mr. Coroner?\"\\n\\n\"You are,\" was the firm response.\\n\\n\"Then, gentlemen,\" continued Frederick, still without looking at Amabel,\\nwhose smile had acquired a mockery that drew the eyes of the jury toward\\nher more than once during the following recital, \"you know, and the\\npublic generally now know, that Mrs. Webb has left me the greater\\nportion of the money of which she died possessed. I have never before\\nacknowledged to anyone, not even to the good man who awaits this jury\\'s\\nverdict on the other side of that door yonder, that she had reasons for\\nthis, good reasons, reasons of which up to the very evening of her death\\nI was myself ignorant, as I was ignorant of her intentions in my regard,\\nor that I was the special object of her attention, or that we were under\\nany mutual obligations in any way. Why, then, I should have thought of\\ngoing to her in the great strait in which I found myself on that day, I\\ncannot say. I knew she had money in her house; this I had unhappily been\\nmade acquainted with in an accidental way, and I knew she was of kindly\\ndisposition and quite capable of doing a very unselfish act. Still, this\\nwould not seem to be reason enough for me to intrude upon her late at\\nnight with a plea for a large loan of money, had I not been in a\\ndesperate condition of mind, which made any attempt seem reasonable that\\npromised relief from the unendurable burden of a pressing and\\ndisreputable debt. I was obliged to have money, a great deal of money,\\nand I had to have it at once; and while I know that this will not serve\\nto lighten the suspicion I have brought upon myself by my late\\nadmissions, it is the only explanation I can give you for leaving the\\nball at my father\\'s house and hurrying down secretly and alone into town\\nto the little cottage where, as I had been told early in the evening, a\\nsmall entertainment was being given, which would insure its being open\\neven at so late an hour as midnight. Miss Page, who will, I am sure,\\npardon the introduction of her name into this narrative, has taken pains\\nto declare to you that in the expedition she herself made into town that\\nevening, she followed some person\\'s steps down-hill. This is very likely\\ntrue, and those steps were probably mine, for after leaving the house by\\nthe garden door, I came directly down the main road to the corner of the\\nlane running past Mrs. Webb\\'s cottage. Having already seen from the\\nhillside the light burning in her upper windows, I felt encouraged to\\nproceed, and so hastened on till I came to the gate on High Street. Here\\nI had a moment of hesitation, and thoughts bitter enough for me to\\nrecall them at this moment came into my mind, making that instant,\\nperhaps, the very worst in my life; but they passed, thank God, and with\\nno more desperate feeling than a sullen intention of having my own way\\nabout this money, I lifted the latch of the front door and stepped in.\\n\\n\"I had expected to find a jovial group of friends in her little ground\\nparlour, or at least to hear the sound of merry voices and laughter in\\nthe rooms above; but no sounds of any sort awaited me; indeed the house\\nseemed strangely silent for one so fully lighted, and, astonished at\\nthis, I pushed the door ajar at my left and looked in. An unexpected and\\npitiful sight awaited me. Seated at a table set with abundance of\\nuntasted food, I saw the master of the house with his head sunk forward\\non his arms, asleep. The expected guests had failed to arrive, and he,\\ntired out with waiting, had fallen into a doze at the board.\\n\\n\"This was a condition of things for which I was not prepared. Mrs. Webb,\\nwhom I wished to see, was probably up-stairs, and while I might summon\\nher by a sturdy rap on the door beside which I stood, I had so little\\ndesire to wake her husband, of whose mental condition I was well aware,\\nthat I could not bring myself to make any loud noise within his hearing.\\nYet I had not the courage to retreat. All my hope of relief from the\\nmany difficulties that menaced me lay in the generosity of this\\ngreat-hearted woman, and if out of pusillanimity I let this hour go by\\nwithout making my appeal, nothing but shame and disaster awaited me. Yet\\nhow could I hope to lure her down-stairs without noise? I could not, and\\nso, yielding to the impulse of the moment, without any realisation, I\\nhere swear, of the effect which my unexpected presence would have on the\\nnoble woman overhead, I slipped up the narrow staircase, and catching at\\nthat moment the sound of her voice calling out to Batsy, I stepped up to\\nthe door I saw standing open before me and confronted her before she\\ncould move from the table before which she was sitting, counting over a\\nlarge roll of money.\\n\\n\"My look (and it was doubtless not a common look, for the sight of a\\nmass of money at that moment, when money was everything to me, roused\\nevery lurking demon in my breast) seemed to appall, if it did not\\nfrighten her, for she rose, and meeting my eye with a gaze in which\\nshock and some strange and poignant agony totally incomprehensible to me\\nwere strangely blended, she cried out:\\n\\n\"\\'No, no, Frederick! You don\\'t know what you are doing. If you want my\\nmoney, take it; if you want my life, I will give it to you with my own\\nhand. Don\\'t stain yours--don\\'t--\\'\\n\\n\"I did not understand her. I did not know until I thought it over\\nafterward that my hand was thrust convulsively into my breast in a way\\nwhich, taken with my wild mien, made me look as if I had come to murder\\nher for the money over which she was hovering. I was blind, deaf to\\neverything but that money, and bending madly forward in a state of\\nmental intoxication awful enough for me to remember now, I answered her\\nfrenzied words by some such broken exclamations as these:\\n\\n\"\\'Give, then! I want hundreds--thousands--now, now, to save myself!\\nDisgrace, shame, prison await me if I don\\'t have them. Give, give!\\' And\\nmy hand went out toward it, not toward her; but she mistook the action,\\nmistook my purpose, and, with a heart-broken cry, to save me, ME, from\\ncrime, the worst crime of which humanity is capable, she caught up a\\ndagger lying only too near her hand in the open drawer against which she\\nleaned, and in a moment of fathomless anguish which we who can never\\nknow more than the outward seeming of her life can hardly measure,\\nplunged against it and--I can tell you no more. Her blood and Batsy\\'s\\nshriek from the adjoining room swam through my consciousness, and then\\nshe fell, as I supposed, dead upon the floor, and I, in scarcely better\\ncase, fell also.\\n\\n\"This, as God lives, is the truth concerning the wound found in the\\nbreast of this never-to-be-forgotten woman.\"\\n\\nThe feeling, the pathos, the anguish even, to be found in his tone made\\nthis story, strange and incredible as it seemed, appear for the moment\\nplausible.\\n\\n\"And Batsy?\" asked the coroner.\\n\\n\"Must have fallen when we did, for I never heard her voice after the\\nfirst scream. But I shall speak of her again. What I must now explain is\\nhow the money in Mrs. Webb\\'s drawer came into my possession, and how the\\ndagger she had planted in her breast came to be found on the lawn\\noutside. When I came to myself, and that must have been very soon, I\\nfound that the blow of which I had been such a horrified witness had not\\nyet proved fatal. The eyes I had seen close, as I had supposed, forever,\\nwere now open, and she was looking at me with a smile that has never\\nleft my memory, and never will.\\n\\n\"\\'There is no blood on you,\\' she murmured. \\'You did not strike the blow.\\nWas it money only that you wanted, Frederick? If so, you could have had\\nit without crime. There are five hundred dollars on that table. Take\\nthem and let them pave your way to a better life. My death will help you\\nto remember.\\' Do these words, this action of hers, seem incredible to\\nyou, sirs? Alas! alas! they will not when I tell you\"--and here he cast\\none anxious, deeply anxious, glance at the room in which Mr. Sutherland\\nwas hidden--\"that unknown to me, unknown to anyone living but herself,\\nunknown to that good man from whom it can no longer be kept hidden,\\nAgatha Webb was my mother. I am Philemon\\'s son and not the offspring of\\nCharles and Marietta Sutherland!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXI\\n\\nA WITNESS LOST\\n\\n\\nImpossible! Incredible!\\n\\nLike a wave suddenly lifted the whole assemblage rose in surprise if not\\nin protest. But there was no outburst. The very depth of the feelings\\nevoked made all ebullition impossible, and as one sees the billow pause\\nere it breaks, and gradually subside, so this crowd yielded to its awe,\\nand man by man sank back into his seat till quiet was again restored,\\nand only a circle of listening faces confronted the man who had just\\nstirred a whole roomful to its depths. Seeing this, and realising his\\nopportunity, Frederick at once entered into the explanations for which\\neach heart there panted.\\n\\n\"This will be overwhelming news to him who has cared for me since\\ninfancy. You have heard him call me son; with what words shall I\\noverthrow his confidence in the truth and rectitude of his long-buried\\nwife and make him know in his old age that he has wasted years of\\npatience upon one who was not of his blood or lineage? The wonder, the\\nincredulity you manifest are my best excuse for my long delay in\\nrevealing the secret entrusted to me by this dying woman.\"\\n\\nAn awed silence greeted these words. Never was the interest of a crowd\\nmore intense or its passions held in greater restraint. Yet Agnes\\'s\\ntears flowed freely, and Amabel\\'s smiles--well, their expression had\\nchanged; and to Sweetwater, who alone had eyes for her now, they were\\nsurcharged with a tragic meaning, strange to see in one of her callous\\nnature.\\n\\nFrederick\\'s voice broke as he proceeded in his self-imposed task.\\n\\n\"The astounding fact which I have just communicated to you was made\\nknown by my mother, with the dagger still plunged in her breast. She\\nwould not let me draw it out. She knew that death would follow that act,\\nand she prized every moment remaining to her because of the bliss she\\nenjoyed of seeing and having near her her only living child. The love,\\nthe passion, the boundless devotion she showed in those last few minutes\\ntransformed me in an instant from a selfish brute into a deeply\\nrepentant man. I knelt before her in anguish. I made her feel that,\\nwicked as I had been, I was not the conscienceless wretch she had\\nimagined, and that she was mistaken as to the motives which led me into\\nher presence. And when I saw, by her clearing brow and peaceful look,\\nthat I had fully persuaded her of this, I let her speak what words she\\nwould, and tell, as she was able, the secret tragedy of her life.\\n\\n\"It is a sacred story to me, and if you must know it, let it be from her\\nown words in the letters she left behind her. She only told me that to\\nsave me from the fate of the children who had preceded me, the five\\nlittle girls and boys who had perished almost at birth in her arms, she\\nhad parted from me in early infancy to Mrs. Sutherland, then mourning\\nthe sudden death of her only child; that this had been done secretly and\\nunder circumstances calculated to deceive Mr. Sutherland, consequently\\nhe had never known I was not his own child, and in terror of the effect\\nwhich the truth might have upon him she enjoined me not to enlighten him\\nnow, if by any sacrifice on my part I could rightfully avoid it; that\\nshe was happy in having me hear the truth before she died; that the joy\\nwhich this gave her was so great she did not regret her fatal act,\\nviolent and uncalled for as it was, for it had showed her my heart and\\nallowed me to read hers. Then she talked of my father, by whom I mean\\nhim whom you call Philemon; and she made me promise I would care for him\\nto the last with tenderness, saying that I would be able to do this\\nwithout seeming impropriety, since she had willed me all her fortune\\nunder this proviso. Finally, she gave me a key, and pointing out where\\nthe money lay hidden, bade me carry it away as her last gift, together\\nwith the package of letters I would find with it. And when I had taken\\nthese and given her back the key, she told me that but for one thing she\\nwould die happy. And though her strength and breath were fast failing\\nher, she made me understand that she was worried about the Zabels, who\\nhad not come according to a sacred custom between them, to celebrate the\\nanniversary of her wedding, and prayed me to see the two old gentlemen\\nbefore I slept, since nothing but death or dire distress would have kept\\nthem from gratifying the one whim of my father\\'s failing mind. I\\npromised, and with perfect peace in her face, she pointed to the dagger\\nin her breast.\\n\\n\"But before I could lay my hand upon it she called for Batsy. \\'I want\\nher to hear me declare before I go,\\' said she, \\'that this stroke was\\ndelivered by myself upon myself.\\' But when I rose to look for Batsy I\\nfound that the shock of her mistress\\'s fatal act had killed her and that\\nonly her dead body was lying across the window-sill of the adjoining\\nroom. It was a chance that robbed me of the only witness who could\\ntestify to my innocence, in case my presence in this house of death\\nshould become known, and realising all the danger in which it threw me,\\nI did not dare to tell my mother, for fear it would make her last\\nmoments miserable. So I told her that the poor woman had understood what\\nshe wished, but was too terrified to move or speak; and this satisfied\\nmy mother and made her last breath one of trust and contented love. She\\ndied as I drew the dagger from her breast, and seeing this, I was seized\\nwith horror of the instrument which had cost me such a dear and valuable\\nlife and flung it wildly from the window. Then I lifted her and laid her\\nwhere you found her, on the sofa. I did not know that the dagger was an\\nold-time gift of her former lover, James Zabel, much less that it bore\\nhis initials on the handle.\"\\n\\nHe paused, and the awe occasioned by the scene he had described was so\\ndeep and the silence so prolonged that a shudder passed over the whole\\nassemblage when from some unknown quarter a single cutting voice arose\\nin this one short, mocking comment:\\n\\n\"Oh, the fairy tale!\"\\n\\nWas it Amabel who spoke? Some thought so and looked her way, but they\\nonly beheld a sweet, tear-stained face turned with an air of moving\\nappeal upon Frederick as if begging pardon for the wicked doubts which\\nhad driven him to this defence.\\n\\nFrederick met that look with one so severe it partook of harshness;\\nthen, resuming his testimony, he said:\\n\\n\"It is of the Zabel brothers I must now speak, and of how one of them,\\nJames by name, came to be involved in this affair.\\n\\n\"When I left my dead mother\\'s side I was in such a state of mind that I\\npassed with scarcely so much as a glance the room where my new-found\\nfather sat sleeping. But as I hastened on toward the quarter where the\\nZabels lived, I was seized by such compunction for his desolate state\\nthat I faltered in my rapid flight and did not arrive at the place of my\\ndestination as quickly as I intended. When I did I found the house dark\\nand the silence sepulchral. But I did not turn away. Remembering my\\nmother\\'s anxiety, an anxiety so extreme it disturbed her final moments,\\nI approached the front door and was about to knock when I found it open.\\nGreatly astonished, I at once passed in, and, seeing my way perfectly in\\nthe moonlight, entered the room on the left, the door of which also\\nstood open. It was the second house I had entered unannounced that\\nnight, and in this as in the other I encountered a man sitting asleep by\\nthe table.\\n\\n\"It was John, the elder of the two, and, perceiving that he was\\nsuffering for food and in a condition of extreme misery, I took out the\\nfirst bill my hand encountered in my overfull pockets and laid it on the\\ntable by his side. As I did so he gave a sigh, but did not wake; and\\nsatisfied that I had done all that was wise and all that even my mother\\nwould expect of me under the circumstances, and fearing to encounter the\\nother brother if I lingered, I hastened away and took the shortest path\\nhome. Had I been more of a man, or if my visit to Mrs. Webb had been\\nactuated by a more communicable motive, I would have gone at once to the\\ngood man who believed me to be of his own flesh and blood, and told him\\nof the strange and heart-rending adventure which had changed the whole\\ntenor of my thoughts and life, and begged his advice as to what I had\\nbetter do under the difficult circumstances in which I found myself\\nplaced. But the memory of a thousand past ingratitudes, together with\\nthe knowledge of the shock which he could not fail to receive on\\nlearning at this late day, and under conditions at once so tragic and\\nfull of menace, that the child which his long-buried wife had once\\nplaced in his arms as his own was neither of her blood nor his, rose up\\nbetween us and caused me not only to attempt silence, but to secrete in\\nthe adjoining woods the money I had received, in the vain hope that all\\nvisible connection between myself and my mother\\'s tragic death would\\nthus be lost. You see I had not calculated on Miss Amabel Page.\"\\n\\nThe flash he here received from that lady\\'s eyes startled the crowd, and\\ngave Sweetwater, already suffering under shock after shock of mingled\\nsurprise and wonder, his first definite idea that he had never rightly\\nunderstood the relations between these two, and that something besides\\njustice had actuated Amabel in her treatment of this young man. This\\nfeeling was shared by others, and a reaction set in in Frederick\\'s\\nfavour, which even affected the officials who were conducting the\\ninquiry. This was shown by the difference of manner now assumed by the\\ncoroner and by the more easily impressed Sweetwater, who had not yet\\nlearned the indispensable art of hiding his feelings. Frederick himself\\nfelt the change and showed it by the look of relief and growing\\nconfidence he cast at Agnes.\\n\\nOf the questions and answers which now passed between him and the\\nvarious members of the jury I need give no account. They but emphasised\\nfacts already known, and produced but little change in the general\\nfeeling, which was now one of suppressed pity for all who had been drawn\\ninto the meshes of this tragic mystery. When he was allowed to resume\\nhis seat, the name of Miss Amabel Page was again called.\\n\\nShe rose with a bound. Nought that she had anticipated had occurred;\\nfacts of which she could know nothing had changed the aspect of affairs\\nand made the position of Frederick something so remote from any she\\ncould have imagined, that she was still in the maze of the numberless\\nconflicting emotions which these revelations were calculated to call out\\nin one who had risked all on the hazard of a die and lost. She did not\\neven know at this moment whether she was glad or sorry he could explain\\nso cleverly his anomalous position. She had caught the look he had cast\\nat Agnes, and while this angered her, it did not greatly modify her\\nopinion that he was destined for herself. For, however other people\\nmight feel, she did not for a moment believe his story. She had not a\\npure enough heart to do so. To her all self-sacrifice was an anomaly. No\\nwoman of the mental or physical strength of Agatha Webb would plant a\\ndagger in her own breast just to prevent another person from committing\\na crime, were he lover, husband, or son. So Amabel believed and so would\\nthese others believe also when once relieved of the magnetic personality\\nof this extraordinary witness. Yet how thrilling it had been to hear him\\nplead his cause so well! It was almost worth the loss of her revenge to\\nmeet his look of hate, and dream of the possibility of turning it later\\ninto the old look of love. Yes, yes, she loved him now; not for his\\nposition, for that was gone; not even for his money, for she could\\ncontemplate its loss; but for himself, who had so boldly shown that he\\nwas stronger than she and could triumph over her by the sheer force of\\nhis masculine daring.\\n\\nWith such feelings, what should she say to these men; how conduct\\nherself under questions which would be much more searching now than\\nbefore? She could not even decide in her own mind. She must let impulse\\nhave its way.\\n\\nHappily, she took the right stand at first. She did not endeavour to\\nmake any corrections in her former testimony, only acknowledging that\\nthe flower whose presence on the scene of death had been such a mystery,\\nhad fallen from her hair at the ball and that she had seen Frederick\\npick it up and put it in his buttonhole. Beyond this, and the inferences\\nit afterward awakened in her mind, she would not go, though many\\npresent, and among them Frederick, felt confident that her attitude had\\nbeen one of suspicion from the first, and that it was to follow him\\nrather than to supply the wants of the old man, Zabel, she had left the\\nball and found her way to Agatha Webb\\'s cottage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXII\\n\\nWHY AGATHA WEBB WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN IN SUTHERLANDTOWN\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile Sweetwater had been witness to a series of pantomimic actions\\nthat interested him more than Amabel\\'s conduct under this final\\nexamination. Frederick, who had evidently some request to make or\\ndirection to give, had sent a written line to the coroner, who, on\\nreading it, had passed it over to Knapp, who a few minutes later was to\\nbe seen in conference with Agnes Halliday. As a result, the latter rose\\nand left the room, followed by the detective. She was gone a half-hour,\\nthen simultaneously with her reappearance, Sweetwater saw Knapp hand a\\nbundle of letters to the coroner, who, upon opening them, chose out\\nseveral which he proceeded to read to the jury. They were the letters\\nreferred to by Frederick as having been given to him by his mother. The\\nfirst was dated thirty-five years previously and was in the handwriting\\nof Agatha herself. It was directed to James Zabel, and was read amid a\\nprofound hush.\\n\\nDEAR JAMES:\\n\\nYou are too presumptuous. When I let you carry me away from John in that\\nmaddening reel last night, I did not mean you to draw the inference you\\ndid. That you did draw it argues a touch of vanity in a man who is not\\nalone in the field where he imagines himself victor. John, who is\\nhumbler, sees some merit in--well, in Frederick Snow, let us say. So do\\nI, but merit does not always win, any more than presumption. When we\\nmeet, let it be as friends, but as friends only. A girl cannot be driven\\ninto love. To ride on your big mare, Judith, is bliss enough for my\\ntwenty years. Why don\\'t you find it so too? I think I hear you say you\\ndo, but only when she stops at a certain gate on Portchester highway.\\nFolly! there are other roads and other gates, though if I should see you\\nenter one--There! my pen is galloping away with me faster than Judith\\never did, and it is time I drew rein. Present my regards to John--But\\nno; then he would know I had written you a letter, and that might hurt\\nhim. How could he guess it was only a scolding letter, such as it would\\ngrieve him to receive, and that it does not count for anything! Were it\\nto Frederick Snow, now--There! some horses are so hard to pull up--and\\nso are some pens. I will come to a standstill, but not before your door.\\n\\nRespectfully your neighbour,\\n\\nAGATHA GILCHRIST.\\n\\n  DEAR JAMES:\\n\\nI know I have a temper, a wicked temper, and now you know it too. When\\nit is roused, I forget love, gratitude, and everything else that should\\nrestrain me, and utter words I am myself astonished at. But I do not get\\nroused often, and when all is over I am not averse to apologising or\\neven to begging forgiveness. My father says my temper will undo me, but\\nI am much more afraid of my heart than I am of my temper. For instance,\\nhere I am writing to you again just because I raised my riding-whip and\\nsaid--But you know what I said, and I am not fond of recalling the\\nwords, for I cannot do so without seeing your look of surprise and\\ncontrasting it with that of Philemon\\'s. Yours had judgment in it, while\\nPhilemon\\'s held only indulgence. Yet I liked yours best, or should have\\nliked it best if it were not for the insufferable pride which is a part\\nof my being. Temper such as mine OUGHT to surprise you, yet would I be\\nAgatha Gilchrist without it? I very much fear not. And not being Agatha\\nGilchrist, should I have your love? Again I fear not. James, forgive me.\\nWhen I am happier, when I know my own heart, I will have less\\nprovocation. Then, if that heart turns your way, you will find a great\\nand bountiful serenity where now there are lowering and thunderous\\ntempests. Philemon said last night that he would be content to have my\\nfierce word o\\' mornings, if only I would give him one drop out of the\\nhoney of my better nature when the sun went down and twilight brought\\nreflection and love. But I did not like him any the better for saying\\nthis. YOU would not halve the day so. The cup with which you would\\nrefresh yourself must hold no bitterness. Will it not have to be\\nproffered, then, by other hands than those of\\n\\nAGATHA GILCHRIST?\\n\\nMR. PHILEMON WEBB.\\n\\nRespected Sir:\\n\\nYou are persistent. I am willing to tell YOU, though I shall never\\nconfide so much to another, that it will take a stronger nature than\\nyours, and one that loves me less, to hold me faithful and make me the\\nhappy, devoted wife which I must be if I would not be a demon. I cannot,\\nI dare not, marry where I am not held in a passionate, self-forgetful\\nsubjection. I am too proud, too sensitive, too little mistress of myself\\nwhen angry or aroused. If, like some strong women, I loved what was\\nweaker than myself, and could be controlled by goodness and unlimited\\nkindness, I might venture to risk living at the side of the most\\nindulgent and upright man I know. But I am not of that kind. Strength\\nonly can command my admiration or subdue my pride. I must fear where I\\nlove, and own for husband him who has first shown himself my master.\\n\\nSo do not fret any more for me, for you, less than any man I know, will\\never claim my obedience or command my love. Not that I will not yield my\\nheart to you, but that I cannot; and, knowing that I cannot, feel it\\nhonest to say so before any more of your fine, young manhood is wasted.\\nGo your ways, then, Philemon, and leave me to the rougher paths my feet\\nwere made to tread. I like you now and feel something like a tender\\nregard for your goodness, but if you persist in a courtship which only\\nmy father is inclined to smile upon, you will call up an antagonism that\\ncan lead to nothing but evil, for the serpent that lies coiled in my\\nbreast has deadly fangs, and is to be feared, as you should know who\\nhave more than once seen me angry.\\n\\nDo not blame John or James Zabel, or Frederick Snow, or even Samuel\\nBarton for this. It would be the same if none of these men existed. I\\nwas not made to triumph over a kindly nature, but to yield the\\nhaughtiest heart in all this county to the gentle but firm control of\\nits natural master. Do you want to know who that master is? I cannot\\ntell you, for I have not yet named him to myself.\\n\\nDEAR JAMES:\\n\\nI am going away. I am going to leave Portchester for several months. I\\nam going to see the world. I did not tell you this last night for fear\\nof weakening under your entreaties, or should I say commands? Lately I\\nhave felt myself weakening more than once, and I want to know what it\\nmeans. Absence will teach me, absence and the sight of new faces. Do you\\nquarrel with this necessity? Do you think I should know my mind without\\nany such test? Alas! James, it is not a simple mind and it baffles me at\\ntimes. Let us then give it a chance. If the glow and glamour of elegant\\ncity life can make me forget certain snatches of talk at our old gate,\\nor that night when you drew my hand through your arm and softly kissed\\nmy fingertips, then I am no mate for you, whose love, however critical,\\nhas never wavered, but has made itself felt, even in rebuke, as the\\nstrongest, sweetest thing that has entered my turbulent life. Because I\\nwould be worthy of you, I submit to a separation which will either be a\\npermanent one or the last that will ever take place between you and me.\\nJohn will not bear this as well as you, yet he does not love me as well,\\npossibly because to him I am simply a superior being, while to you I am\\na loving but imperfect woman who wishes to do right but can only do so\\nunder the highest guidance.\\n\\nDEAR JOHN:\\n\\nI feel that I owe you a letter because you have been so patient. You may\\nshow it to James if you like, but I mean it for you as an old and dear\\nfriend who will one day dance at my wedding.\\n\\nI am living in a whirl of enjoyment. I am seeing and tasting of\\npleasures I have only dreamed about till now. From a farmhouse kitchen\\nto Mrs. Andrews\\'s drawing-room is a lively change for a girl who loves\\ndress and show only less than daily intercourse with famous men and\\nbrilliant women. But I am bearing it nobly and have developed tastes I\\ndid not know I possessed; expensive tastes, John, which I fear may unfit\\nme for the humble life of a Portchester matron. Can you imagine me\\ndressed in rich brocade, sitting in the midst of Washington\\'s choicest\\ncitizens and exchanging sallies with senators and judges? You may find\\nit hard, yet so it is, and no one seems to think I am out of place, nor\\ndo I feel so, only--do not tell James--there are movements in my heart\\nat times which make me shut my eyes when the lights are brightest, and\\ndream, if but for an instant, of home and the tumble-down gateway where\\nI have so often leaned when someone (you know who it is now, John, and I\\nshall not hurt you too deeply by mentioning him) was saying good-night\\nand calling down the blessings of Heaven upon a head not worthy to\\nreceive them.\\n\\nDoes this argue my speedy return? Perhaps. Yet I do not know. There are\\nfond hearts here also, and a life in this country\\'s centre would be a\\ngreat life for me if only I could forget the touch of a certain\\nrestraining hand which has great power over me even as a memory. For the\\nsake of that touch shall I give up the grandeur and charm of this broad\\nlife? Answer, John. You know him and me well enough now to say.\\n\\nDEAR JOHN:\\n\\nI do not understand your letter. You speak in affectionate terms of\\neverybody, yet you beg me to wait and not be in a hurry to return. Why?\\nDo you not realise that such words only make me the more anxious to see\\nold Portchester again? If there is anything amiss at home, or if James\\nis learning to do without me--but you do not say that; you only intimate\\nthat perhaps I will be better able to make up my mind later than now,\\nand hint of great things to come if I will only hold my affections in\\ncheck a little longer. This is all very ambiguous and demands a fuller\\nexplanation. So write to me once more, John, or I shall sever every\\nengagement I have made here and return.\\n\\nDEAR JOHN:\\n\\nYour letter is plain enough this time. James read the letter I wrote you\\nabout my pleasure in the life here and was displeased at it. He thinks I\\nam growing worldly and losing that simplicity which he has always looked\\nupon as my most attractive characteristic. So! so! Well, James is right;\\nI am becoming less the country girl and more the woman of the world\\nevery day I remain here. That means I am becoming less worthy of him.\\nSo--But whatever else I have to say on this topic must be said to him.\\nFor this you will pardon me like the good brother you are. I cannot help\\nmy preference. He is nearer my own age; besides, we were made for each\\nother.\\n\\nDEAR JAMES:\\n\\nI am not worldly; I am not carried away by the pleasures and\\nsatisfactions of this place,--at least not to the point of forgetting\\nwhat is dearer and better. I have seen Washington, I have seen gay life;\\nI like it, but I LOVE Portchester. Consequently I am going to return to\\nPortchester, and that very soon. Indeed I cannot stay away much longer,\\nand if you are glad of this, and if you wish to be convinced that a girl\\nwho has been wearing brocade and jewels can content herself quite gaily\\nagain with calico, come up to the dear old gate a week from now and you\\nwill have the opportunity. Do you object to flowers? I may wear a flower\\nin my hair.\\n\\nYour wayward but ever-constant\\n\\nAGATHA.\\n\\nDEAR JAMES:\\n\\nWhy must I write? Why am I not content with the memory of last night?\\nWhen one\\'s cup is quite full, a cup that has been so long in\\nfilling,--must some few drops escape just to show that a great joy like\\nmine is not satisfied to be simply quiescent? I have suffered so long\\nfrom uncertainty, have tried you and tried myself with so tedious an\\nindecision, that, now I know no other man can ever move my heart as you\\nhave done, the ecstasy of it makes me over-demonstrative. I want to tell\\nyou that I love you; that I do not simply accept your love, but give you\\nback in fullest measure all the devotion you have heaped upon me in\\nspite of my many faults and failings. You took me to your heart last\\nnight, and seemed satisfied; but it does not satisfy me that I just let\\nyou do it without telling you that I am proud and happy to be the chosen\\none of your heart, and that as I saw your smile and the proud passion\\nwhich lit up your face, I felt how much sweeter was the dear domestic\\nbliss you promised me than the more brilliant but colder life of a\\nstatesman\\'s wife in Washington.\\n\\nI missed the flower from my hair when I went back to my room last night.\\nDid you take it, dear? If so, do not cherish it. I hate to think of\\nanything withering on your breast. My love is deathless, James, and owns\\nno such symbol as that. But perhaps you are not thinking of my love, but\\nof my faults. If so, let the flower remain where you have put it; and\\nwhen you gaze on it say, \"Thus is it with the defects of my darling;\\nonce in full bloom, now a withered remembrance. When I gathered her they\\nbegan to fade.\" O James, I feel as if I never could feel anger again.\\n\\nDEAR JAMES:\\n\\nI do not, I cannot, believe it. Though you said to me on going out,\\n\"Your father will explain,\" I cannot content myself with his\\nexplanations and will never believe what he said of you except you\\nconfirm his accusations by your own act. If, after I have told you\\nexactly what passed between us, you return me this and other letters,\\nthen I shall know that I have leaned my weight on a hollow staff, and\\nthat henceforth I am to be without protector or comforter in this world.\\n\\nO James, were we not happy! I believed in you and felt that you believed\\nin me. When we stood heart to heart under the elm tree (was it only last\\nnight?) and you swore that if it lay in the power of earthly man to make\\nme happy, I should taste every sweet that a woman\\'s heart naturally\\ncraved, I thought my heaven had already come and that now it only\\nremained for me to create yours. Yet that very minute my father was\\napproaching us, and in another instant we heard these words:\\n\\n\"James, I must talk with you before you make my daughter forget herself\\nany further.\" Forget herself! What had happened? This was not the way my\\nfather had been accustomed to talk, much as he had always favoured the\\nsuit of Philemon Webb, and pleased as he would have been had my choice\\nfallen on him. Forget herself! I looked at you to see how these\\ninsulting words would affect you. But while you turned pale, or seemed\\nto do so in the fading moonlight, you were not quite so unprepared for\\nthem as I was myself, and instead of showing anger, followed my father\\ninto the house, leaving me shivering in a spot which had held no chill\\nfor me a moment before. You were gone--how long? To me it seemed an\\nhour, and perhaps it was. It would seem to take that long for a man\\'s\\nface to show such change as yours did when you confronted me again in\\nthe moonlight. Yet a lightning stroke makes quick work, and perhaps my\\ncountenance in that one minute showed as great a change as yours. Else\\nwhy did you shudder away from me, and to my passionate appeal reply with\\nthis one short phrase: \"Your father will explain\"? Did you think any\\nother words than yours would satisfy me, or that I could believe even\\nhim when he accused you of a base and dishonest act? Much as I have\\nalways loved and revered my father, I find it impossible not to hope\\nthat in his wish to see me united to Philemon he has resorted to an\\nunworthy subterfuge to separate us; therefore I give you our interview\\nword for word. May it shock you as much as it shocked me. Here is what\\nhe said first:\\n\\n\"Agatha, you cannot marry James Zabel. He is not an honest man. He has\\ndefrauded me, ME, your father, of several thousand dollars. In a clever\\nway, too, showing him to be as subtle as he is unprincipled. Shall I\\ntell you the wretched story, my girl? He has left me to do so. He sees\\nas plainly as I do that any communication between you two after the\\ndiscovery I have this day made would be but an added offence. He is at\\nleast a gentleman, which is something, considering how near he came to\\nbeing my son-in-law.\"\\n\\nI may have answered. People do cry out when they are stabbed, sometimes,\\nbut I rather think I did not say a word, only looked a disdain which at\\nthat minute was as measureless as my belief in you. YOU dishonest?\\nYOU--Or perhaps I laughed; that would have been truer to my feeling;\\nyes, I must have laughed.\\n\\nMy father\\'s next words indicated that I did something.\\n\\n\"You do not believe in his guilt,\" he went on, and there was a kindness\\nin his tone which gave me my first feeling of real terror. \"I can\\nreadily comprehend that, Agatha. He has been in my office and acted\\nunder my eye for several years now, and I had almost as much confidence\\nin him as you had, notwithstanding the fact that I liked him much better\\nas my confidential clerk than as your probable or prospective husband.\\nHe has never held the key to my heart; would God he never had to yours!\\nBut he was a good and reliable man in the office, or so I thought, and I\\ngave into his hand much of the work I ought to have done myself,\\nespecially since my health has more or less failed me. My trust he\\nabused. A month ago--it was during that ill turn you remember I received\\na letter from a man I had never expected to hear from again. He was in\\nmy debt some ten thousand dollars, and wrote that he had brought with\\nhim as much of this sum as he had been able to save in the last five\\nyears, to Sutherlandtown, where he was now laid up with a dangerous\\nillness from which he had small hope of recovering. Would I come there\\nand get it? He was a stranger and wished to take no one into his\\nconfidence, but he had the money and would be glad to place it in my\\nhands. He added that as he was a lone man, without friends or relatives\\nto inherit from him, he felt a decided pleasure at the prospect of\\nsatisfying his only creditor, and devoutly hoped he would be well enough\\nto realise the transaction and receive my receipt. But if his fever\\nincreased and he should be delirious or unconscious when I reached him,\\nthen I was to lift up the left-hand corner of the mattress on which he\\nlay and take from underneath his head a black wallet in which I would\\nfind the money promised me. He had elsewhere enough to pay all his\\nexpenses, so that the full contents of the wallet were mine.\\n\\n\"I remembered the man and I wanted the money; so, not being able to go\\nfor it myself, I authorised James Zabel to collect it for me. He started\\nat once for Sutherlandtown, and in a few hours returned with the wallet\\nalluded to. Though I was suffering intensely at the time, I remember\\ndistinctly the air with which he laid it down and the words with which\\nhe endeavoured to carry off a certain secret excitement visible in him.\\n\\'Mr. Orr was alive, sir, and fully conscious; but he will not outlive\\nthe night. He seemed quite satisfied with the messenger and gave up the\\nwallet without any hesitation.\\' I roused up and looked at him. \\'What has\\nshaken you up so?\\' I asked. He was silent a moment before replying. \\'I\\nhave ridden fast,\\' said he; then more slowly, \\'One feels sorry for a man\\ndying alone and amongst strangers.\\' I thought he showed an unnecessary\\nemotion, but paid no further heed to it at the time.\\n\\n\"The wallet held two thousand and more dollars, which was less than I\\nexpected, but yet a goodly sum and very welcome. As I was counting it\\nover I glanced at the paper accompanying it. It was an acknowledgment of\\ndebt and mentioned the exact sum I should find in the wallet--$2753.67.\\nPointing them out to James, I remarked, \\'The figures are in different\\nink from the words. How do you account for that?\\' I thought his answer\\nrather long in coming, though when it did come it was calm, if not\\nstudied. \\'I presume,\\' said he, \\'that the sum was inserted at\\nSutherlandtown, after Mr. Orr was quite sure just how much he could\\nspare for the liquidation of this old debt.\\' \\'Very likely,\\' I assented,\\nnot bestowing another thought upon the matter.\\n\\n\"But to-day it has been forced back upon my attention in a curious if\\nnot providential way. I was over in Sutherlandtown for the first time\\nsince my illness, and having some curiosity about my unfortunate but\\nhonest debtor, went to the hotel and asked to see the room in which he\\ndied. It being empty they at once showed it to me; and satisfied that he\\nhad been made comfortable in his last hours, I was turning away, when I\\nespied on a table in one corner an inkstand and what seemed to be an old\\ncopy-book. Why I stopped and approached this table I do not know, but\\nonce in front of it I remembered what Zabel had said about the figures,\\nand taking up the pen I saw there, I dipped it in the ink-pot and\\nattempted to scribble a number or two on a piece of loose paper I found\\nin the copy-book. The ink was thick and the pen corroded, so that it was\\nnot till after several ineffectual efforts that I succeeded in making\\nany strokes that were at all legible. But when I did, they were so\\nexactly similar in colour to the numbers inserted in Mr. Orr\\'s\\nmemorandum (which I had fortunately brought with me) that I was\\ninstantly satisfied this especial portion of the writing had been done,\\nas James had said, in this room, and with the very pen I was then\\nhandling. As there was nothing extraordinary in this, I was turning\\naway, when a gust of wind from the open window lifted the loose sheet of\\npaper I had been scribbling on and landed it, the other side up, on the\\ncarpet. As I stooped for it I saw figures on it, and feeling sure that\\nthey had been scrawled there by Mr. Orr in his attempt to make the pen\\nwrite, I pulled out the memorandum again and compared the two minutely.\\nThey were the work of the same hand, but the figures on the stray leaf\\ndiffered from those in the memorandum in a very important particular.\\nThose in the memorandum began with a 2, while those on the stray sheet\\nbegan with a 7--a striking difference. Look, Agatha, here is the piece\\nof paper just as I found it. You see here, there, and everywhere the one\\nset of figures, 7753.67. Here it is hardly legible, here it is blotted\\nwith too much ink, here it is faint but sufficiently distinct, and\\nhere--well, there can be no mistake about these figures, 7753.67; yet\\nthe memorandum reads, $2753.67, and the money returned to me amounts to\\n$2753.67--a clean five thousand dollars\\' difference.\"\\n\\nHere, James, my father paused, perhaps to give me a commiserating look,\\nthough I did not need it; perhaps to give himself a moment in which to\\nregain courage for what he still had to say. I did not break the\\nsilence; I was too sure of your integrity; besides, my tongue could not\\nhave moved if it would; all my faculties seemed frozen except that\\ninstinct which cried out continually within me: \"No! there is no fault\\nin James. He has done no wrong. No one but himself shall ever convince\\nme that he has robbed anyone of anything except poor me of my poor\\nheart.\" But inner cries of this kind are inaudible and after a moment\\'s\\ninterval my father went on:\\n\\n\"Five thousand dollars is no petty sum, and the discrepancy in the two\\nsets of figures which seemed to involve me in so considerable a loss set\\nme thinking. Convinced that Mr. Orr would not be likely to scribble one\\nnumber over so many times if it was not the one then in his mind, I went\\nto Mr. Forsyth\\'s office and borrowed a magnifying-glass, through which I\\nagain subjected the figures in the memorandum to a rigid scrutiny. The\\nresult was a positive conviction that they had been tampered with after\\ntheir first writing, either by Mr. Orr himself or by another whom I need\\nnot name. The 2 had originally been a 7, and I could even see where the\\ntop line of the 7 had been given a curl and where a horizontal stroke\\nhad been added at the bottom.\\n\\n\"Agatha, I came home as troubled a man as there was in all these parts.\\nI remembered the suppressed excitement which had been in James Zabel\\'s\\nface when he handed me over the money, and I remembered also that you\\nloved him, or thought you did, and that, love or no love, you were\\npledged to marry him. If I had not recalled all this I might have\\nproceeded more warily. As it was, I took the bold and open course and\\ngave James Zabel an opportunity to explain himself. Agatha, he did not\\nembrace it. He listened to my accusations and followed my finger when I\\npointed out the discrepancy between the two sets of figures, but he made\\nno protestations of innocence, nor did he show me the front of an honest\\nman when I asked if he expected me to believe that the wallet had held\\nonly two thousand and over when Mr. Orr handed it over to him. On the\\ncontrary he seemed to shrink into himself like a person whose life has\\nbeen suddenly blasted, and replying that he would expect me to believe\\nnothing except his extreme contrition at the abuse of confidence of\\nwhich he had been guilty, begged me to wait till to-morrow before taking\\nany active steps in the matter. I replied that I would show him that\\nmuch consideration if he would immediately drop all pretensions to your\\nhand. This put him in a bad way; but he left, as you see, with just a\\nsimple injunction to you to seek from me an explanation of his strange\\ndeparture. Does that look like innocence or does it look like guilt?\"\\n\\nI found my tongue at this and passionately cried: \"James Zabel\\'s life,\\nas I have known it, shows him to be an honest man. If he has done what\\nyou suggest, given you but a portion of the money entrusted to him and\\naltered the figures in the memorandum to suit the amount he brought you,\\nthen there is a discrepancy between this act and all the other acts of\\nhis life which I find it more difficult to reconcile than you did the\\ntwo sets of figures in Mr. Orr\\'s handwriting. Father, I must hear from\\nhis own lips a confirmation of your suspicions before I will credit\\nthem.\"\\n\\nAnd this is why I write you so minute an account of what passed between\\nmy father and myself last night. If his account of the matter is a\\ncorrect one, and you have nothing to add to it in way of explanation,\\nthen the return of this letter will be token enough that my father has\\nbeen just in his accusations and that the bond between us must be\\nbroken. But if--O James, if you are the true man I consider you, and all\\nthat I have heard is a fabrication or mistake, then come to me at once;\\ndo not delay, but come at once, and the sight of your face at the gate\\nwill be enough to establish your innocence in my eyes.\\n\\nAGATHA. \\n\\nThe letter that followed this was very short:\\n\\nDEAR JAMES:\\n\\nThe package of letters has been received. God help me to bear this shock\\nto all my hopes and the death of all my girlish beliefs. I am not angry.\\nOnly those who have something left to hold on to in life can be angry.\\n\\nMy father tells me he has received a packet too. It contained five\\nthousand dollars in ten five-hundred-dollar notes. James! James! was not\\nmy love enough, that you should want my father\\'s money too?\\n\\nI have begged my father, and he has promised me, to keep the cause of\\nthis rupture secret. No one shall know from either of us that James\\nZabel has any flaw in his nature.\\n\\nThe next letter was dated some months later. It is to Philemon:\\n\\nDEAR PHILEMON:\\n\\nThe gloves are too small; besides, I never wear gloves. I hate their\\nrestraint and do not feel there is any good reason for hiding my hands,\\nin this little country town where everyone knows me. Why not give them\\nto Hattie Weller? She likes such things, while I have had my fill of\\nfinery. A girl whose one duty is to care for a dying father has no room\\nleft in her heart for vanities.\\n\\nDEAR PHILEMON:\\n\\nIt is impossible. I have had my day of love and my heart is quite dead.\\nShow your magnanimity by ceasing to urge me any longer to forget the\\npast. It is all you can do for\\n\\nAGATHA.\\n\\nDEAR PHILEMON:\\n\\nYou WILL have my hand though I have told you that my heart does not go\\nwith it. It is hard to understand such persistence, but if you are\\nsatisfied to take a woman of my strength against her will, then God have\\nmercy upon you, for I will be your wife.\\n\\nBut do not ask me to go to Sutherlandtown. I will live here. And do not\\nexpect to keep up your intimacy with the Zabels. There is no tie of\\naffection remaining between James and myself, but if I am to shed that\\nhalf-light over your home which is all I can promise and all that you\\ncan hope to receive, then keep me from all influence but your own. That\\nthis in time may grow sweet and dear to me is my earnest prayer to-day,\\nfor you are worthy of a true wife.\\n\\nAGATHA.\\n\\nDEAR JOHN:\\n\\nI am going to be married. My father exacts it and there is no good\\nreason why I should not give him this final satisfaction. At least I do\\nnot think there is; but if you or your brother differ from me--Say\\ngood-bye to James from me. I pray that his life may be peaceful. I know\\nthat it will be honest.\\n\\nAGATHA.\\n\\nDEAR PHILEMON:\\n\\nMy father is worse. He fears that if we wait till Tuesday he will not be\\nable to see us married. Decide, then, what our duty is; I am ready to\\nabide by your pleasure.\\n\\nAGATHA.\\n\\nThe following is from John Zabel to his brother James, and is dated one\\nday after the above:\\n\\nDEAR JAMES:\\n\\nWhen you read this I will be far away, never to look in your face again,\\nunless you bid me. Brother, brother, I meant it for the best, but God\\nwas not with me and I have made four hearts miserable without giving\\nhelp to anyone.\\n\\nWhen I read Agatha\\'s letter--the last for more reasons than one that I\\nshall ever receive from her--I seemed to feel as never before what I had\\ndone to blast your two lives. For the first time I realised to the full\\nthat but for me she might have been happy and you the respected husband\\nof the one grand woman to be found in Portchester. That I had loved her\\nso fiercely myself came back to me in reproach, and the thought that she\\nperhaps suspected that the blame had fallen where it was not deserved\\nroused me to such a pitch that I took the sudden and desperate\\nresolution of telling her the truth before she gave her hand to\\nPhilemon. Why the daily sight of your misery should not have driven me\\nbefore to this act, I cannot tell. Some remnants of the old jealousy may\\nhave been still festering in my heart; or the sense of the great\\ndistance between your self-sacrificing spirit and the selfishness of my\\nweaker nature risen like a barrier between me and the only noble act\\nleft for a man in my position. Whatever the cause, it was not till\\nto-day the full determination came to brave the obloquy of a full\\nconfession; but when it did come I did not pause till I reached Mr.\\nGilchrist\\'s house and was ushered into his presence.\\n\\nHe was lying on the sitting-room lounge, looking very weak and\\nexhausted, while on one side of him stood Agatha and on the other\\nPhilemon, both contemplating him with ill-concealed anxiety. I had not\\nexpected to find Philemon there, and for a moment I suffered the extreme\\nagony of a man who has not measured the depth of the plunge he is about\\nto take; but the sight of Agatha trembling under the shock of my\\nunexpected presence restored me to myself and gave me firmness to\\nproceed. Advancing with a bow, I spoke quickly the one word I had come\\nthere to say.\\n\\n\"Agatha, I have done you a great wrong and I am here to undo it. For\\nmonths I have felt driven to confession, but not till to-day have I\\npossessed the necessary courage. NOW, nothing shall hinder me.\"\\n\\nI said this because I saw in both Mr. Gilchrist and Philemon a\\ndisposition to stop me where I was. Indeed Mr. Gilchrist had risen on\\nhis elbow and Philemon was making that pleading gesture of his which we\\nknow so well.\\n\\nAgatha alone looked eager. \"What is it?\" she cried. \"I have a right to\\nknow.\" I went to the door, shut it, and stood with my back against it, a\\nfigure of shame and despair; suddenly the confession burst from me.\\n\"Agatha,\" said I, \"why did you break with my brother James? Because you\\nthought him guilty of theft; because you believed he took the five\\nthousand dollars out of the sum entrusted to him by Mr. Orr for your\\nfather. Agatha, it was not James who did this it was I; and James knew\\nit, and bore the blame of my misdoing because he was always a loyal soul\\nand took account of my weakness and knew, alas! too well, that open\\nshame would kill me.\"\\n\\nIt was a weak plea and merited no reply. But the silence was so dreadful\\nand lasted so long that I felt first crushed and then terrified. Raising\\nmy head, for I had not dared to look any of them in the face, I cast one\\nglance at the group before me and dropped my head again, startled. Only\\none of the three was looking at me, and that was Agatha. The others had\\ntheir heads turned aside, and I thought, or rather the passing fancy\\ntook me, that they shrank from meeting her gaze with something of the\\nsame shame and dread I myself felt. But she! Can I ever hope to make you\\nrealise her look, or comprehend the pang of utter self-abasement with\\nwhich I succumbed before it? It was so terrible that I seemed to hear\\nher utter words, though I am sure she did not speak; and with some wild\\nidea of stemming the torrent of her reproaches, I made an effort at\\nexplanation, and impetuously cried: \"It was not for my own good, Agatha,\\nnot for self altogether, I did this. I too loved you, madly,\\ndespairingly, and, good brother as I seemed, I was jealous of James and\\nhoped to take his place in your regard if I could show a greater\\nprosperity and get for you those things his limited prospects denied\\nhim. You enjoy money, beauty, ease; I could see that by your letters,\\nand if James could not give them to you and I could--Oh, do not look at\\nme like that! I see now that millions could not have bought you.\"\\n\\n\"Despicable!\" was all that came from her lips. At which I shuddered and\\ngroped about for the handle of the door. But she would not let me go.\\nSubduing with an unexpected grand self-restraint the emotions which had\\nhitherto swelled too high in her breast for either speech or action, she\\nthrust out one arm to stay me and said in short, commanding tones: \"How\\nwas this thing done? You say you took the money, yet it was James who\\nwas sent to collect it--or so my father says.\" Here she tore her looks\\nfrom me and cast one glance at her father. What she saw I cannot say,\\nbut her manner changed and henceforth she glanced his way as much as\\nmine and with nearly as much emotion. \"I am waiting to hear what you\\nhave to say,\" she exclaimed, laying her hand on the door over my head so\\nas to leave me no opportunity for escape. I bowed and attempted an\\nexplanation.\\n\\n\"Agatha,\" said I, \"the commission was given to James and he rode to\\nSutherlandtown to perform it. But it was on the day when he was\\naccustomed to write to you, and he was not easy in his mind, for he\\nfeared he would miss sending you his usual letter. When, therefore, he\\ncame to the hotel and saw me in Philemon\\'s room--I was often there in\\nthose days, often without Philemon\\'s knowing it--he saw, or thought he\\ndid, a way out of his difficulties. Entering where I was, he explained\\nto me his errand, and we being then--though never, alas! since--one in\\neverything but the secret hopes he enjoyed, he asked me if I would go in\\nhis stead to Mr. Orr\\'s room, present my credentials, and obtain the\\nmoney while he wrote the letter with which his mind was full. Though my\\njealousy was aroused and I hated the letter he was about to write, I did\\nnot see how I could refuse him; so after receiving such credentials as\\nhe himself carried, and getting full instructions how to proceed, I left\\nhim writing at Philemon\\'s table and hastened down the hall to the door\\nhe had pointed out. If Providence had been on the side of guilt, the\\ncircumstances could not have been more favourable for the deception I\\nafterwards played. No one was in the hall, no one was with Mr. Orr to\\nnote that it was I instead of James who executed Mr. Gilchrist\\'s\\ncommission. But I was thinking of no deception then. I proceeded quite\\ninnocently on my errand, and when the feeble voice of the invalid bade\\nme enter, I experienced nothing but a feeling of compassion for a man\\ndying in this desolate way, alone. Of course Mr. Orr was surprised to\\nsee a stranger, but after reading Mr. Gilchrist\\'s letter which I handed\\nhim, he seemed quite satisfied and himself drew out the wallet at the\\nhead of his bed and handed it over. \\'You will find,\\' said he, \\'a\\nmemorandum inside of the full amount, $7758.67. I should like to have\\nreturned Mr. Gilchrist the full ten thousand which I owe him, but this\\nis all I possess, barring a hundred dollars which I have kept for my\\nfinal expenses.\\' \\'Mr. Gilchrist will be satisfied,\\' I assured him.\\n\\'Shall I make you out a receipt?\\' He shook his head with a sad smile. \\'I\\nshall be dead in twenty-four hours. What good will a receipt do me?\\' But\\nit seemed unbusinesslike not to give it, so I went over to the table,\\nwhere I saw a pen and paper, and recognising the necessity of counting\\nthe money before writing a receipt, I ran my eye over the bills, which\\nwere large, and found the wallet contained just the amount he had named.\\nThen I glanced at the memorandum. It had evidently been made out by him\\nat some previous time, for the body of the writing was in firm\\ncharacters and the ink blue, while the figures were faintly inscribed in\\nmuddy black. The 7 especially was little more than a straight line, and\\nas I looked at it the devil that is in every man\\'s nature whispered at\\nfirst carelessly, then with deeper and deeper insistence: \\'How easy it\\nwould be to change that 7 to a 2! Only a little mark at the top and the\\nleast additional stroke at the bottom and these figures would stand for\\nfive thousand less. It might be a temptation to some men.\\' It presently\\nbecame a temptation to me; for, glancing furtively up, I discovered that\\nMr. Orr had fallen either into a sleep or into a condition of\\ninsensibility which made him oblivious to my movements. Five thousand\\ndollars! just the sum of the ten five-hundred-dollar bills that made the\\nbulk of the amount I had counted. In this village and at my age this sum\\nwould raise me at once to comparative independence. The temptation was\\ntoo strong for resistance. I succumbed to it, and seizing the pen before\\nme, I made the fatal marks. When I went back to James the wallet was in\\nmy hand, and the ten five-hundred-dollar bills in my breast pocket.\"\\n\\nAgatha had begun to shudder. She shook so she rattled the door against\\nwhich I leaned.\\n\\n\"And when you found that Providence was not so much upon your side as\\nyou thought, when you saw that the fraud was known and that your brother\\nwas suspected of it--\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t!\" I pleaded, \"don\\'t make me recall that hour!\"\\n\\nBut she was inexorable. \"Recall that and every hour,\" she commanded.\\n\"Tell me why he sacrificed himself, why he sacrificed me, to a cur--\"\\n\\nShe feared her own tongue, she feared her own anger, and stopped.\\n\"Speak,\" she whispered, and it was the most ghastly whisper that ever\\nleft mortal lips. I was but a foot from her and she held me as by a\\nstrong enchantment. I could not help obeying her.\\n\\n\"To make it all clear,\" I pursued, \"I must go back to the time I\\nrejoined James in Philemon\\'s room. He had finished his letter when I\\nentered and was standing with it, sealed, in his hand. I may have cast\\nit a disdainful glance. I may have shown that I was no longer the same\\nman I had been when I left him a half-hour before, for he looked\\ncuriously at me for a moment previous to saying:\\n\\n\"\\'Is that the wallet you have there? Was Mr. Orr conscious, and did he\\ngive it to you himself?\\' \\'Mr. Orr was conscious,\\' I returned,--and I\\ndidn\\'t like the sound of my own voice, careful as I was to speak\\nnaturally,--\\' but he fainted just before I came out, and I think you had\\nbetter ask the clerk as you go down to send someone up to him.\\'\\n\\n\"James was weighing the pocket-book in his hand. \\'How much do you think\\nthere is in here? The debt was ten thousand.\\' I had turned carelessly\\naway and was looking out of the window. \\'The memorandum inside gives the\\nfigures as two thousand,\\' I declared. \\'He apologises for not sending the\\nfull amount. He hasn\\'t it.\\' Again I felt James looking at me. Why? Could\\nhe see that guilty wad of bills lying on my breast? \\'How came you to\\nread the memorandum?\\' he asked. \\'Mr. Orr wished me to. I looked at it to\\nplease him.\\' This was a lie--the first I had ever uttered. James\\'s eyes\\nhad not moved. \\'John,\\' said he, \\'this little bit of business seems to\\nhave disturbed you. I ought to have attended to it myself. I am quite\\nsure I ought to have attended to it myself.\\' \\'The man is dying,\\' I\\nmuttered. \\'You escaped a sad sight. Be satisfied that you have got the\\nmoney. Shall I post that letter for you?\\' He put it jealously in his\\npocket, and again I saw him look at me, but he said nothing more except\\nthat he repeated that same phrase, \\'I ought to have attended to it\\nmyself. Agatha might better have waited.\\' Then he went out; but I\\nremained till Philemon came home. My brother and myself were no longer\\ncompanions; a crime divided us,--a crime he could not suspect, yet which\\nmade itself felt in both our hearts and prepared him for the revelation\\nmade to him by Mr. Gilchrist some weeks after. That night he came to\\nSutherlandtown, where I was, and entered my bedroom--not in the\\nfraternal way of the old days, but as an elder enters the presence of a\\nyounger. \\'John,\\' he said, without any preamble or preparation, \\'where\\nare the five thousand dollars you kept back from Mr. Gilchrist? The\\nmemorandum said seven and you delivered to me only two.\\' There are\\ndeath-knells sounded in every life; those words sounded mine, or would\\nhave if he had not immediately added: \\'There! I knew you had no stamina.\\nI have taken your crime on myself, who am really to blame for it, since\\nI delegated my duty to another, and you will only have to bear the\\ndisgrace of having James Zabel for a brother. In exchange, give me the\\nmoney; it shall be returned to-morrow. You cannot have disposed of it\\nalready. After which, you, or rather I, will be in the eyes of the world\\nonly a thief in intent, not in fact.\\' Had he only stopped there!--but he\\nwent on: \\'Agatha is lost to me, John. In return, be to me the brother I\\nalways thought you up to the unhappy day the sin of Achan came between\\nus.\\'\\n\\n\"YOU were lost to him! It was all I heard. YOU were lost to him! Then,\\nif I acknowledged the crime I should not only take up my own burden of\\ndisgrace, but see him restored to his rights over the only woman I had\\never loved. The sacrifice was great and my virtue was not equal to it. I\\ngave him back the money, but I did not offer to assume the\\nresponsibility of my own crime.\"\\n\\n\"And since?\"\\n\\nIn what a hard tone she spoke!\\n\\n\"I have had to see Philemon gradually assume the rights James once\\nenjoyed.\"\\n\\n\"John,\" she asked,--she was under violent self-restraint,--\"why do you\\ncome now?\"\\n\\nI cast my eyes at Philemon. He was standing, as before, with his eyes\\nturned away. There was discouragement in his attitude, mingled with a\\ncertain grand patience. Seeing that he was better able to bear her loss\\nthan either you or myself, I said to her very low, \"I thought you ought\\nto know the truth before you gave your final word. I am late, but I\\nwould have been TOO LATE a week from now.\"\\n\\nHer hand fell from the door, but her eyes remained fixed on my face.\\nNever have I sustained such a look; never will I encounter such another.\\n\\n\"It is too late NOW,\" she murmured. \"The clergyman has just gone who\\nunited me to Philemon.\"\\n\\nThe next minute her back was towards me; she had faced her father and\\nher new-made husband.\\n\\n\"Father, you knew this thing!\" Keen, sharp, incisive, the words rang\\nout. \"I saw it in your face when he began to speak.\"\\n\\nMr. Gilchrist drooped slightly; he was a very sick man and the scene\\nhad been a trying one.\\n\\n\"If I did,\" was his low response, \"it was but lately. You were engaged\\nthen to Philemon. Why break up this second match?\"\\n\\nShe eyed him as if she found it difficult to credit her ears. Such\\nindifference to the claims of innocence was incredible to her. I saw her\\ngrand profile quiver, then the slow ebbing from her cheek of every drop\\nof blood indignation had summoned there.\\n\\n\"And you, Philemon?\" she suggested, with a somewhat softened aspect.\\n\"You committed this wrong ignorantly. Never having heard of this crime,\\nyou could not know on what false grounds I had been separated from\\nJames.\"\\n\\nI had started to escape, but stopped just beyond the threshold of the\\ndoor as she uttered these words. Philemon was not as ignorant as she\\nsupposed. This was evident from his attitude and expression.\\n\\n\"Agatha,\" he began, but at this first word, and before he could clasp\\nthe hands held helplessly out before her, she gave a great cry, and\\nstaggering back, eyed both her father and himself in a frenzy of\\nindignation that was all the more uncontrollable from the superhuman\\neffort which she had hitherto made to suppress it.\\n\\n\"You too!\" she shrieked. \"You too! and I have just sworn to love,\\nhonour, and obey you! Love YOU! Honour YOU! the unconscionable wretch\\nwho--\"\\n\\nBut here Mr. Gilchrist rose. Weak, tottering, quivering with something\\nmore than anger, he approached his daughter and laid his finger on her\\nlips.\\n\\n\"Be quiet!\" he said. \"Philemon is not to blame. A month ago he came to\\nme and prayed that as a relief to his mind I would tell him why you had\\nseparated yourself from James. He had always thought the match had\\nfallen through on account of some foolish quarrel or incompatibility,\\nbut lately he had feared there was something more than he suspected in\\nthis break, something that he should know. So I told him why you had\\ndismissed James; and whether he knew James better than we did, or\\nwhether he had seen something in his long acquaintance with these\\nbrothers which influenced his judgment, he said at once: \\'This cannot be\\ntrue of James. It is not in his nature to defraud any man; but John--I\\nmight believe it of John. Isn\\'t there some complication here?\\' I had\\nnever thought of John, and did not see how John could be mixed up with\\nan affair I had supposed to be a secret between James and myself, but\\nwhen we came to locate the day, Philemon remembered that on returning to\\nhis room that night, he had found John awaiting him. As his room was not\\nfive doors from that occupied by Mr. Orr, he was convinced that there\\nwas more to this matter than I had suspected. But when he laid the\\nmatter before James, he did not deny that John was guilty, but was\\nperemptory in wishing you not to be told before your marriage. He knew\\nthat you were engaged to a good man, a man that your father approved, a\\nman that could and would make you happy. He did not want to be the means\\nof a second break, and besides, and this, I think, was at the bottom of\\nthe stand he took, for James Zabel was always the proudest man I ever\\nknew,--he never could bear, he said, to give to one like Agatha a name\\nwhich he knew and she knew was not entirely free from reproach. It would\\nstand in the way of his happiness and ultimately of hers; his brother\\'s\\ndishonour was his. So while he still loved you, his only prayer was that\\nafter you were safely married and Philemon was sure of your affection,\\nhe should tell you that the man you once regarded so favourably was not\\nunworthy of that regard. To obey him, Philemon has kept silent, while\\nI--Agatha, what are you doing? Are you mad, my child?\"\\n\\nShe looked so for the moment. Tearing off the ring which she had worn\\nbut an hour, she flung it on the floor. Then she threw her arms high up\\nover her head and burst out in an awful voice:\\n\\n\"Curses on the father, curses on the husband, who have combined to make\\nme rue the day I was born! The father I cannot disown, but the\\nhusband--\"\\n\\n\"Hush!\"\\n\\nIt was Mr. Gilchrist who dared her fury. Philemon said nothing.\\n\\n\"Hush! he may be the father of your children. Don\\'t curse--\"\\n\\nBut she only towered the higher and her beauty, from being simply\\nmajestic, became appalling.\\n\\n\"Children!\" she cried. \"If ever I bear children to this man, may the\\nblight of Heaven strike them as it has struck me this day. May they die\\nas my hopes have died, or, if they live, may they bruise his heart as\\nmine is bruised, and curse their father as--\"\\n\\nHere I fled the house. I was shaking as if this awful denunciation had\\nfallen on my own head. But before the door closed behind me, a different\\ncry called me back. Mr. Gilchrist was lying lifeless on the floor, and\\nPhilemon, the patient, tender Philemon, had taken Agatha to his breast\\nand was soothing her there as if the words she had showered upon him had\\nbeen blessings instead of the most fearful curses which had ever left\\nthe lips of mortal woman.\\n\\nThe next letter was in Agatha\\'s handwriting. It was dated some months\\nlater and was stained and crumpled more than any other in the whole\\npacket. Could Philemon once have told why? Were these blotted lines the\\nresult of his tears falling fast upon them, tears of forty years ago,\\nwhen he and she were young and love had been doubtful? Was the sheet so\\nyellowed and so seamed because it had been worn on his breast and folded\\nand unfolded so often? Philemon, thou art in thy grave, sleeping sweetly\\nat last by thy deeply idolised one, but these marks of feeling still\\nremain indissolubly connected with the words that gave them birth.\\n\\nDEAR PHILEMON:\\n\\nYou are gone for a day and a night only, but it seems a lengthened\\nabsence to me, meriting a little letter. You have been so good to me,\\nPhilemon, ever since that dreadful hour following our marriage, that\\nsometimes--I hardly dare yet to say always--I feel that I am beginning\\nto love you and that God did not deal with me so harshly when He cast me\\ninto your arms. Yesterday I tried to tell you this when you almost\\nkissed me at parting. But I was afraid it was a momentary sentimentality\\nand so kept still. But to-day such a warm well-spring of joy rises in my\\nheart when I think that to-morrow the house will be bright again, and\\nthat in place of the empty wall opposite me at table I shall see your\\nkindly and forbearing face, I know that the heart I had thought\\nimpregnable has begun to yield, and that daily gentleness, and a\\nboundless consideration from one who had excuse for bitter thoughts and\\nrecrimination, are doing what all of us thought impossible a few short\\nmonths ago.\\n\\nOh, I am so happy, Philemon, so happy to love where it is now my duty to\\nlove; and if it were not for that dreadful memory of a father dying with\\nharsh words in his ears, and the knowledge that you, my husband, yet not\\nmy husband, are bearing ever about with you echoes of words that in\\nanother nature would have turned tenderness into gall, I could be merry\\nalso and sing as I go about the house making it pleasant and comfortable\\nagainst your speedy return. As it is I can but lay my hand softly on my\\nheart as its beatings grow too impetuous and say, \"God bless my absent\\nPhilemon and help him to forgive me! I forgive him and love him as I\\nnever thought I could.\"\\n\\nThat you may see that these are not the weak outpourings of a lonely\\nwoman, I will here write that I heard to-day that John and James Zabel\\nhave gone into partnership in the ship-building business, John\\'s uncle\\nhaving left him a legacy of several thousand dollars. I hope they will\\ndo well. James, they say, is full of business and is, to all appearance,\\nperfectly cheerful. This relieves me from too much worry in his regard.\\nGod certainly knew what kind of a husband I needed. May you find\\nyourself equally blessed in your wife.\\n\\nAnother letter to Philemon, a year later:\\n\\nDEAR PHILEMON:\\n\\nHasten home, Philemon; I do not like these absences. I am just now too\\nweak and fearful. Since we knew the great hope before us, I have looked\\noften in your face for a sign that you remembered what this hope cannot\\nbut recall to my shuddering memory. Philemon, Philemon, was I mad? When\\nI think what I said in my rage, and then feel the little life stirring\\nabout my heart, I wonder that God did not strike me dead rather than\\nbestow upon me the greatest blessing that can come to woman. Philemon,\\nPhilemon, if anything should happen to the child! I think of it by day,\\nI think of it by night. I know you think of it too, though you show me\\nsuch a cheerful countenance and make such great plans for the future.\\n\"Will God remember my words, or will He forget? It seems as if my reason\\nhung upon this question.\"\\n\\nA note this time in answer to one from John Zabel:\\n\\nDEAR JOHN:\\n\\nThank you for words which could have come from nobody else. My child is\\ndead. Could I expect anything different? If I did, God has rebuked me.\\n\\nPhilemon thinks only of me. We understand each other so perfectly now\\nthat our greatest suffering comes in seeing each other\\'s pain. My load I\\ncan bear, but HIS--Come and see me, John; and tell James our house is\\nopen to him. We have all done wrong, and are caught in one net of\\nmisfortune. Let it make us friends again.\\n\\nBelow this in Philemon\\'s hand:\\n\\nMy wife is superstitious. Strong and capable as she is, she has regarded\\nthis sudden taking off of our first-born as a sign that certain words\\nuttered by her on her marriage day, unhappily known to you and, as I\\ntake it, to James also, have been remembered by the righteous God above\\nus. This is a weakness which I cannot combat. Can you, who alone of all\\nthe world beside know both it and its cause, help me by a renewed\\nfriendship, whose cheerful and natural character may gradually make her\\nforget? If so, come like old neighbours, and dine with us on our wedding\\nday. If God sees that we have buried the past and are ready to forgive\\neach other the faults of our youth, perhaps He will further spare this\\ngood woman. I think she will be able to bear it. She has great strength\\nexcept where a little child is concerned. That alone can henceforth stir\\nthe deepest recesses of her heart.\\n\\nAfter this, a gap of years. One, two, three, four, five children were\\nlaid away to rest in Portchester churchyard, then Philemon and she came\\nto Sutherlandtown; but not till after a certain event had occurred, best\\nmade known by this last letter to Philemon:\\n\\nDEAREST HUSBAND:\\n\\nOur babe is born, our sixth and our dearest, and the reproach of its\\nfirst look had to be met by me alone. Oh, why did I leave you and come\\nto this great Boston where I have no friend but Mrs. Sutherland? Did I\\nthink I could break the spell of fate or providence by giving birth to\\nmy last darling among strangers? I shall have to do something more than\\nthat if I would save this child to our old age. It is borne in upon me\\nlike fate that never will a child prosper at my breast or survive the\\nclasp of my arms. If it is to live it must be reared by others. Some\\nwoman who has not brought down the curse of Heaven upon her by her own\\nblasphemies must nourish the tender frame and receive the blessing of\\nits growing love. Neither I nor you can hope to see recognition in our\\nbabe\\'s eye. Before it can turn upon us with love, it will close in its\\nlast sleep and we will be left desolate. What shall we do, then, with\\nthis little son? To whose guardianship can we entrust it? Do you know a\\nman good enough or a woman sufficiently tender? I do not, but if God\\nwills that our little Frederick should live, He will raise up someone.\\nBy the pang of possible separation already tearing my heart, I believe\\nthat He WILL raise up someone. Meanwhile I do not dare to kiss the\\nchild, lest I should blight it. He is so sturdy, Philemon, so different\\nfrom all the other five.\\n\\nI open this to add that Mrs. Sutherland has just been in--with her\\nfive-weeks-old infant. His father is away, too, and has not yet seen his\\nboy; and this is their first after ten years of marriage. Oh, that my\\nfuture opened before me as brightly as hers!\\n\\nThe next letter opens with a cry:\\n\\nPhilemon! Come to me, Philemon! I have done what I threatened. I have\\nmade the sacrifice. Our child is no longer ours, and now, perhaps, he\\nmay live. But oh, my breaking heart! my empty arms! Help me to bear my\\ndesolation, for it is for life. We will never have another child.\\n\\nAnd where is it? Ah, that is the wonder of it. Near you, Philemon, yet\\nnot too near. Mrs. Sutherland has it, and you may have seen its little\\nface through the car window if you were in the station last night when\\nthe express passed through to Sutherlandtown. Ah! but she has her burden\\nto bear too. An awful, secret burden like my own, only she will have the\\nchild--for, Philemon, she has taken it in lieu of her own, which died\\nlast night in my sight; and Mr. Sutherland does not know what she has\\ndone, and never will, if you keep the secret as I shall, for the sake of\\nthe life our little innocent has thus won.\\n\\nWhat do I mean and how was it all? Philemon, it was God\\'s work, all but\\nthe deception, and that is for the good of all, and to save four broken\\nhearts. Listen. Yesterday, only yesterday,--it seems a month ago,--Mrs.\\nSutherland came again to see me with her baby in her arms. Mr.\\nSutherland is expected home, as you know, this week, and she was about\\nto start out for Sutherlandtown so as to be in her own house when he\\ncame. The baby was looking well and she was the happiest of women; for\\nthe one wish of his heart and hers had been fulfilled and she was soon\\ngoing to have the bliss of showing the child to his father. My own babe\\nwas on the bed asleep, and I, who am feeling wonderfully strong, was\\nsitting up in a little chair as far away from him as possible, not out\\nof hatred or indifference--oh, no!--but because he seemed to rest better\\nwhen left entirely by himself and not under the hungry look of my eye.\\nMrs. Sutherland went over to look at it. \"Oh, he is fair like my baby,\"\\nshe said, \"and almost as sturdy, though mine is a month older.\" And she\\nstooped down and kissed him. Philemon, he smiled for her, though he\\nnever had for me. I saw it with a greedy longing that almost made me cry\\nout. Then I turned to her and we talked.\\n\\nOf what? I cannot remember now. At home we had never been intimate\\nfriends. She is from Sutherlandtown and I am from Portchester, and the\\ndistance of nine miles is enough to estrange people. But here, each with\\na husband absent and a darling infant lying asleep under our eyes,\\ninterests we have never thought identical drew us to one another and we\\nchatted with ever-increasing pleasure--when suddenly Mrs. Sutherland\\njumped up in a terrible fright. The infant she had been rocking on her\\nbreast was blue; the next minute it shuddered; the next--it lay in her\\narms DEAD!\\n\\nI hear the shriek yet with which she fell with it still in her arms to\\nthe floor. Fortunately no other ears were open to her cry. I alone saw\\nher misery. I alone heard her tale. The child had been poisoned,\\nPhilemon, poisoned by her. She had mistaken a cup of medicine for a cup\\nof water and had given the child a few drops in a spoon just before\\nsetting out from her hotel. She had not known at the time what she had\\ndone, but now she remembered that the fatal cup was just like the other\\nand that the two stood very near together. Oh, her innocent child, and\\noh, her husband!\\n\\nIt seemed as if the latter thought would drive her wild. \"He has so\\nwished for a child,\" she moaned. \"We have been married ten years and\\nthis baby seemed to have been sent from heaven. He will curse me, he\\nwill hate me, he will never be able after this to bear me in his sight.\"\\nThis was not true of Mr. Sutherland, but it was useless to argue with\\nher. Instead of attempting it, I took another way to stop her ravings.\\nLifting the child out of her hands, I first listened at its heart, and\\nthen, finding it was really dead,--Philemon, I have seen too many\\nlifeless children not to know,--I began slowly to undress it. \"What are\\nyou doing?\" she cried. \"Mrs. Webb, Mrs. Webb, what are you doing?\" For\\nreply I pointed to the bed, where two little arms could be seen feebly\\nfluttering. \"You shall have my child,\" I whispered. \"I have carried too\\nmany babies to the tomb to dare risk bringing up another.\" And catching\\nher poor wandering spirit with my eye, I held her while I told her my\\nstory.\\n\\nPhilemon, I saved that woman. Before I had finished speaking I saw the\\nreason return to her eye and the dawning of a pitiful hope in her\\npassion-drawn face. She looked at the child in my arms and then she\\nlooked at the one in the bed, and the long-drawn sigh with which she\\nfinally bent down and wept over our darling told me that my cause was\\nwon. The rest was easy. When the clothes of the two children had been\\nexchanged, she took our baby in her arms and prepared to leave. Then I\\nstopped her. \"Swear,\" I cried, holding her by the arm and lifting my\\nother hand to heaven, \"swear you will be a mother to this child! Swear\\nyou will love it as your own and rear it in the paths of truth and\\nrighteousness!\" The convulsive clasp with which she drew the baby to her\\nbreast assured me more than her shuddering \"I swear!\" that her heart had\\nalready opened to it. I dropped her arm and covered my face with my\\nhands. I could not see my darling go; it was worse than death--for the\\nmoment it was worse than death. \"O God, save him!\" I groaned. \"God, make\\nhim an honour--\" But here she caught me by the arm. Her clutch was\\nfrenzied, her teeth were chattering. \"Swear in your turn!\" she gasped.\\n\"Swear that if I do a mother\\'s duty by this boy, you will keep my secret\\nand never, never reveal to my husband, to the boy, or to the world that\\nyou have any claims upon him!\" It was like tearing the heart from my\\nbreast with my own hand, but I swore, Philemon, and she in her turn drew\\nback. But suddenly she faced me again, terror and doubt in all her\\nlooks. \"Your husband!\" she whispered. \"Can you keep such a secret from\\nhim? You will breathe it in your dreams.\" \"I shall tell him,\" I\\nanswered. \"Tell him!\" The hair seemed to rise on her forehead and she\\nshook so that I feared she would drop the babe. \"Be careful!\" I cried.\\n\"See! you frighten the babe. My husband has but one heart with me. What\\nI do he will subscribe to. Do not fear Philemon.\" So I promised in your\\nname. Gradually she grew calmer. When I saw she was steady again, I\\nmotioned her to go. Even my more than mortal strength was failing, and\\nthe baby--Philemon, I had never kissed it and I did not kiss it then. I\\nheard her feet draw slowly towards the door, I heard her hand fall on\\nthe knob, heard it turn, uttered one cry, and then----\\n\\nThey found me an hour after, lying along the floor, clasping the dead\\ninfant in my arms. I was in a swoon, and they all think I fell with the\\nchild, as perhaps I did, and that its little life went out during my\\ninsensibility. Of its features, like and yet unlike our boy\\'s, no one\\nseems to take heed. The nurse who cared for it is gone, and who else\\nwould know that little face but me? They are very good to me, and are\\nfull of self-reproaches for leaving me so long in my part of the\\nbuilding alone. But though they watch me now, I have contrived to write\\nthis letter, which you will get with the one telling of the baby\\'s death\\nand my own dangerous condition. Destroy it, Philemon, and then COME.\\nNothing in all the world will give me comfort but your hand laid under\\nmy head and your true eyes looking into mine. Ah, we must love each\\nother now, and live humbly! All our woe has come from my early girlish\\ndelight in gay and elegant things. From this day on I eschew all\\nvanities and find in your affection alone the solace which Heaven will\\nnot deny to our bewildered hearts. Perhaps in this way the blessing that\\nhas been denied us will be visited on our child, who will live. I am now\\nsure, to be the delight of our hearts and the pride of our eyes, even\\nthough we are denied the bliss of his presence and affection.\\n\\nMrs. Sutherland was not seen to enter or go out of my rooms. Being on\\nher way to the depot, she kept on her way, and must be now in her own\\nhome. Her secret is safe, but ours--oh, you will help me to preserve it!\\nHelp me not to betray--tell them I have lost five babies before this\\none--delirious--there may be an inquest--she must not be mentioned--let\\nall the blame fall on me if there is blame--I fell--there is a bruise on\\nthe baby\\'s forehead--and--and--I am growing incoherent--I will try and\\ndirect this and then love--love--O God!\\n\\n[A scrawl for the name.]\\n\\nUnder it these words:\\n\\nThough bidden to destroy this, I have never dared to do so. Some day it\\nmay be of inestimable value to us or our boy. PHILEMON WEBB.\\n\\nThis was the last letter found in the first packet. As it was laid down,\\nsobs were heard all over the room, and Frederick, who for some time now\\nhad been sitting with his head in his hands, ventured to look up and\\nsay: \"Do you wonder that I endeavoured to keep this secret, bought at\\nsuch a price and sealed by the death of her I thought my mother and of\\nher who really was? Gentlemen, Mr. Sutherland loved his wife and\\nhonoured her memory. To tell him, as I shall have to within the hour,\\nthat the child she placed in his arms twenty-five years ago was an\\nalien, and that all his love, his care, his disappointment, and his\\nsufferings had been lavished on the son of a neighbour, required greater\\ncourage than to face doubt on the faces of my fellow-townsmen, or\\nanything, in short, but absolute arraignment on the charge of murder.\\nHence my silence, hence my indecision, till this woman\"--here he pointed\\na scornful finger at Amabel, now shrinking in her chair--\"drove me to it\\nby secretly threatening me with a testimony which would have made me the\\nmurderer of my mother and the lasting disgrace of a good man who alone\\nhas been without blame from the beginning to the end of this desperate\\naffair. She was about to speak when I forestalled her. My punishment, if\\nI deserve such, will be to sit and hear in your presence the reading of\\nthe letters still remaining in the coroner\\'s hands.\"\\n\\nThese letters were certain ones written by Agatha to her unacknowledged\\nson. They had never been sent. The first one dated from his earliest\\ninfancy, and its simple and touching hopefulness sent a thrill through\\nevery heart. It read as follows:\\n\\nThree years old, my darling! and the health flush has not faded from\\nyour cheek nor the bright gold from your hair.\\n\\nOh, how I bless Mrs. Sutherland that she did not rebuke me when your\\nfather and I came to Sutherlandtown and set up our home where I could at\\nleast see your merry form toddling through the streets, holding on to\\nthe hand of her who now claims your love. My darling, my pride, my\\nangel, so near and yet so far removed, will you ever know, even in the\\nheaven to which we all look for joy after our weary pilgrimage is over,\\nhow often in this troublous world, and in these days of your early\\ninfancy, I have crept out of my warm bed, dressed myself, and, without a\\nword to your father, whose heart it would break, gone out and climbed\\nthe steep hillside just to look at the window of your room to see if it\\nwere light or dark and you awake or sleeping? To breathe the scent of\\nthe eglantine which climbs up to your nursery window, I have braved the\\nnight-damps and the watching eyes of Heaven; but you have a child\\'s\\nblissful ignorance of all this; you only grow and grow and live, my\\ndarling, LIVE!--which is the only boon I crave, the only recompense I\\nask.\\n\\nHave I but added another sin to my account and brought a worse vengeance\\non myself than that of seeing you die in your early infancy? Frederick,\\nmy son, my son, I heard you swear to-day! Not lightly, thoughtlessly, as\\nboys sometimes will in imitation of their elders, but bitterly,\\nrevengefully, as if the seeds of evil passions were already pushing to\\nlife in the boyish breast I thought so innocent. Did you wonder at the\\nstrange woman who stopped you? Did you realise the awful woe from which\\nmy commonplace words sprang? No, no, what grown mind could take that in,\\nleast of all a child\\'s? To have forsworn the bliss of motherhood and\\nentered upon a life of deception for THIS! Truly Heaven is implacable\\nand my last sin is to be punished more inexorably than my first.\\n\\nThere are worse evils than death. This I have always heard, but now I\\nknow it. God was merciful when He slew my babes, and I, presumptous in\\nmy rebellion, and the efforts with which I tried to prevent His work.\\nFrederick, you are weak, dissipated, and without conscience. The darling\\nbabe, the beautiful child, has grown into a reckless youth whose\\nimpulses Mr. Sutherland will find it hard to restrain, and over whom his\\nmother--do _I_ call her your mother?--has little influence, though she\\ntries hard to do a mother\\'s part and save herself and myself from\\nboundless regret. My boy, my boy, do you feel the lack of your own\\nmother\\'s vigour? Might you have lived under my care and owned a better\\nrestraint and learned to work and live a respectable life in\\ncircumstances less provocative of self-indulgence? Such questions, when\\nthey rise, are maddening. When I see them form themselves in Philemon\\'s\\neyes I drive them out with all the force of my influence, which is still\\nstrong over him. But when they make way in my own breast, I can find no\\nrelief, not even in prayer. Frederick, were I to tell you the truth\\nabout your parentage, would the shock of such an unexpected revelation\\nmake a man of you? I have been tempted to make the trial, at times. Deep\\ndown in my heart I have thought that perhaps I should best serve the\\ngood man who is growing grey under your waywardness, by opening up\\nbefore you the past and present agonies of which you are the unconscious\\ncentre. But I cannot do this while SHE lives. The look she gave me one\\nday when I approached you a step too near at the church door, proves\\nthat it would be the killing of her to reveal her long-preserved secret\\nnow. I must wait her death, which seems near, and then--No, I cannot do\\nit. Mr. Sutherland has but one staff to lean on, and that is you. It may\\nbe a poor one, a breaking one, but it is still a staff. I dare not take\\nit away--I dare not. Ah, if Philemon was the man he was once, he might\\ncounsel me, but he is only a child now; just as if God had heard my cry\\nfor children and had given me--HIM.\\n\\nMore money, and still more money! and I hate it except for what it will\\ndo for the poor and incapable about me. How strange are the ways of\\nProvidence! To us who have no need of aught beyond a competence, money\\npours in almost against our will, while to those who long and labour for\\nit, it comes not, or comes so slowly the life wears out in the waiting\\nand the working. The Zabels, now! Once well-to-do ship-builders, with a\\ngood business and a home full of curious works of art, they now appear\\nto find it hard to obtain even the necessities of life. Such are the\\nfreaks of fortune; or should I say, the dealings of an inscrutable\\nProvidence? Once I tried to give something out of my abundance to these\\nold friends, but their pride stood in the way and the attempt failed.\\nWorse than that. As if to show that benefits should proceed from them to\\nme rather than from me to them, James bestowed on me a gift. It is a\\nstrange one,--nothing more nor less than a quaint Florentine dagger\\nwhich I had often admired for its exquisite workmanship. Was it the last\\ntreasure he possessed? I am almost afraid so. At all events it shall lie\\nhere in my table-drawer where I alone can see it. Such sights are not\\ngood for Philemon. He must have cheerful objects before him, happy faces\\nsuch as mine tries to be. But ah!\\n\\nI would gladly give my life if I could once hold you in my arms, my\\nerring but beloved son. Will the day ever come when I can? Will you have\\nstrength enough to hear my story and preserve your peace and let me go\\ndown to the grave with the memory of one look, one smile, that is for me\\nalone? Sometimes I foresee this hour and am happy for a few short\\nminutes; and then some fresh story of your recklessness is wafted\\nthrough the town and--What stopped her at this point we shall never\\nknow. Some want of Philemon\\'s, perhaps. At all events she left off here\\nand the letter was never resumed. It was the last secret outpouring of\\nher heart. With this broken sentence Agatha\\'s letters terminated..\\n\\n......\\n\\nThat afternoon, before the inquiry broke up, the jury brought in their\\nverdict. It was:\\n\\n\"Death by means of a wound inflicted upon herself in a moment of terror\\nand misapprehension.\"\\n\\nIt was all his fellow-townsmen could do for Frederick.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXIII\\n\\nFATHER AND SON\\n\\n\\nBut Frederick\\'s day of trial was not yet over. There was a closed door\\nto open and a father to see (as in his heart he still called Mr.\\nSutherland). Then there were friends to face, and foes, under conditions\\nhe better than anyone else, knew were in some regards made worse rather\\nthan better by the admissions and revelations of this eventful\\nday--Agnes, for instance. How could he meet her pure gaze? But it was\\nhis father he must first confront, his father to whom he would have to\\nrepeat in private the tale which robbed the best of men of a past, and\\ntook from him a son, almost a wife, without leaving him one memory\\ncalculated to console him. Frederick was so absorbed in this\\nanticipation that he scarcely noticed the two or three timid hands\\nstretched out in encouragement toward him, and was moving slowly toward\\nthe door behind which his father had disappeared so many hours before,\\nwhen he was recalled to the interests of the moment by a single word,\\nuttered not very far from him. It was simply, \"Well?\" But it was uttered\\nby Knapp and repeated by Mr. Courtney.\\n\\nFrederick shuddered, and was hurrying on when he found himself stopped\\nby a piteous figure that, with appealing eyes and timid gestures,\\nstepped up before him. It was Amabel.\\n\\n\"Forgive!\" she murmured, looking like a pleading saint. \"I did not\\nknow--I never dreamed--you were so much of a man, Frederick: that you\\nbore such a heart, cherished such griefs, were so worthy of love and a\\nwoman\\'s admiration. If I had--\"\\n\\nHer expression was eloquent, more eloquent than he had ever seen it, for\\nit had real feeling in it; but he put her coldly by.\\n\\n\"When my father\\'s white hairs become black again, and the story of my\\nshame is forgotten in this never-forgetting world, then come back and I\\nwill forgive you.\"\\n\\nAnd he was passing on when another touch detained him. He turned, this\\ntime in some impatience, only to meet the frank eyes of Sweetwater. As\\nhe knew very little of this young man, save that he was the amateur\\ndetective who had by some folly of his own been carried off on the\\nHesper, and who was probably the only man saved from its wreck, he was\\nabout to greet him with some commonplace phrase of congratulation, when\\nSweetwater interrupted him with the following words:\\n\\n\"I only wanted to say that it may be easier for you to approach your\\nfather with the revelations you are about to make if you knew that in\\nhis present frame of mind he is much more likely to be relieved by such\\nproofs of innocence as you can give him than overwhelmed by such as show\\nthe lack of kinship between you. For two weeks Mr. Sutherland has been\\nbending under the belief of your personal criminality in this matter.\\nThis was his secret, which was shared by me.\"\\n\\n\"By you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, by me! I am more closely linked to this affair than you can\\nreadily imagine. Some day I may be able to explain myself, but not now.\\nOnly remember what I have said about your father--pardon me, I should\\nperhaps say Mr. Sutherland--and act accordingly. Perhaps it was to tell\\nyou this that I was forced back here against my will by the strangest\\nseries of events that ever happened to a man. But,\" he added, with a\\nsidelong look at the group of men still hovering about the coroner\\'s\\ntable, \"I had rather think it was for some more important office still.\\nBut this the future will show,--the future which I seem to see lowering\\nin the faces over there.\"\\n\\nAnd, waiting for no reply, he melted into the crowd.\\n\\nFrederick passed at once to his father.\\n\\nNo one interrupted them during this solemn interview, but the large\\ncrowd that in the halls and on the steps of the building awaited\\nFrederick\\'s reappearance showed that the public interest was still warm\\nin a matter affecting so deeply the heart and interests of their best\\ncitizen. When, therefore, that long-closed door finally opened and\\nFrederick was seen escorting Mr. Sutherland on his arm, the tide of\\nfeeling which had not yet subsided since Agatha\\'s letters were read\\nvented itself in one great sob of relief. For Mr. Sutherland\\'s face was\\ncalmer than when they had last seen it, and his step more assured, and\\nhe leaned, or made himself lean, on Frederick\\'s arm, as if to impress\\nupon all who saw them that the ties of years cannot be shaken off so\\neasily, and that he still looked upon Frederick as his son.\\n\\nBut he was not contented with this dumb show, eloquent as it was. As the\\ncrowd parted and these two imposing figures took their way down the\\nsteps to the carriage which had been sent for them, Mr. Sutherland cast\\none deep and long glance about him on faces he knew and on faces he did\\nnot know, on those who were near and those who were far, and raising his\\nvoice, which did not tremble as much as might have been expected, said\\ndeliberately:\\n\\n\"My son accompanies me to his home. If he should afterwards be wanted,\\nhe will be found at his own fireside. Good-day, my friends. I thank you\\nfor the goodwill you have this day shown us both.\"\\n\\nThen he entered the carriage.\\n\\nThe solemn way in which Frederick bared his head in acknowledgment of\\nthis public recognition of the hold he still retained on this one\\nfaithful heart, struck awe into the hearts of all who saw it. So that\\nthe carriage rolled off in silence, closing one of the most thrilling\\nand impressive scenes ever witnessed in that time-worn village.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXIV\\n\\n\"NOT WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG GIRLS\"\\n\\n\\nBut, alas! all tides have their ebb as well as flow, and before Mr.\\nSutherland and Frederick were well out of the main street the latter\\nbecame aware that notwithstanding the respect with which his\\nexplanations had been received by the jury, there were many of his\\nfellow-townsmen who were ready to show dissatisfaction at his being\\nallowed to return in freedom to that home where he had still every\\nprospect of being called the young master. Doubt, that seed of ramifying\\ngrowth, had been planted in more than one breast, and while it failed as\\nyet to break out into any open manifestation, there were evidences\\nenough in the very restraint visible in such groups of people as they\\npassed that suspicion had not been suppressed or his innocence\\nestablished by the over-favourable verdict of the coroner\\'s jury.\\n\\nTo Mr. Sutherland, suffering now from the reaction following all great\\nefforts, much, if not all, of this quiet but significant display of\\npublic feeling passed unnoticed. But to Frederick, alive to the least\\nlook, the least sign that his story had not been accepted unquestioned,\\nthis passage through the town was the occasion of the most poignant\\nsuffering.\\n\\nFor not only did these marks of public suspicion bespeak possible\\narraignment in the future, but through them it became evident that even\\nif he escaped open condemnation in the courts, he could never hope for\\ncomplete reinstatement before the world, nor, what was to him a still\\ndeeper source of despair, anticipate a day when Agnes\\'s love should make\\namends to him for the grief and errors of his more than wayward youth.\\nHe could never marry so pure a being while the shadow of crime separated\\nhim from the mass of human beings. Her belief in his innocence and the\\nexact truth of his story (and he was confident she did believe him)\\ncould make no difference in this conclusion. While he was regarded\\nopenly or in dark corners or beside the humblest fireside as a possible\\ncriminal, neither Mr. Sutherland nor her father, nor his own heart even,\\nwould allow him to offer her anything but a friend\\'s gratitude, or win\\nfrom her anything but a neighbour\\'s sympathy; yet in bidding good-bye to\\nlarger hopes and more importunate desires, he parted with the better\\npart of his heart and the only solace remaining in this world for the\\nboundless griefs and tragic experiences of his still young life. He had\\nlearned to love through suffering, only to realise that the very nature\\nof his suffering forbade him to indulge in love.\\n\\nAnd this seemed a final judgment, even in this hour of public\\njustification. He had told his story and been for the moment believed,\\nbut what was there in his life, what was there in the facts as witnessed\\nby others, what was there in his mother\\'s letters and the revelation of\\ntheir secret relationship, to corroborate his assertions, or to prove\\nthat her hand and not his had held the weapon when the life-blood gushed\\nfrom her devoted breast? Nothing, nothing; only his word to stand\\nagainst all human probabilities and natural inference; only his word and\\nthe generous nature of the great-hearted woman who had thus perished!\\nThough a dozen of his fellow-citizens had by their verdict professed\\ntheir belief in his word and given him the benefit of a doubt involving\\nhis life as well as his honour, he, as well as they, knew that neither\\nthe police nor the general public were given to sentimentality, and that\\nthe question of his guilt still lay open and must remain so till his\\ndying day. For from the nature of things no proof of the truth was\\nprobable. Batsy being dead, only God and his own heart could know that\\nthe facts of that awful half-hour were as he had told them.\\n\\nHad God in His justice removed in this striking way his only witness, as\\na punishment for his sins and his mad indulgence in acts so little short\\nof crime as to partake of its guilt and merit its obloquy?\\n\\nHe was asking himself this question as he bent to fasten the gate. His\\nfather had passed in, the carriage had driven off, and the road was\\nalmost solitary--but not quite. As he leaned his arm over the gate and\\nturned to take a final glance down the hillside, he saw, with what\\nfeelings no one will ever know, the light figure of Agnes advancing on\\nthe arm of her father.\\n\\nHe would have drawn back, but a better impulse intervened and he stood\\nhis ground. Mr. Halliday, who walked very close to Agnes, cast her an\\nadmonitory glance which Frederick was not slow in interpreting, then\\nstopped reluctantly, perhaps because he saw her falter, perhaps because\\nhe knew that an interview between these two was unavoidable and had best\\nbe quickly over.\\n\\nFrederick found his voice first.\\n\\n\"Agnes,\" said he, \"I am glad of this opportunity for expressing my\\ngratitude. You have acted like a friend and have earned my eternal\\nconsideration, even if we never speak again.\"\\n\\nThere was a momentary silence. Her head, which had drooped under his\\ngreeting, rose again. Her eyes, humid with feeling, sought his face.\\n\\n\"Why do you speak like that?\" said she. \"Why shouldn\\'t we meet? Does not\\neveryone recognise your innocence, and will not the whole world soon\\nsee, as I have, that you have left the old life behind and have only to\\nbe your new self to win everyone\\'s regard?\"\\n\\n\"Agnes,\" returned Frederick, smiling sadly as he observed the sudden\\nalarm visible in her father\\'s face at these enthusiastic words, \"you\\nknow me perhaps better than others do and are prepared to believe my\\nwords and my more than unhappy story. But there are few like you in the\\nworld. People in general will not acquit me, and if there was only one\\nperson who doubted \"--Mr. Halliday began to look relieved--\"I would fail\\nto give any promise of the new life you hope to see me lead, if I\\nallowed the shadow under which I undoubtedly rest to fall in the\\nremotest way across yours. You and I have been friends and will continue\\nsuch, but we will hold little intercourse in future, hard as I find it\\nto say so. Does not Mr. Halliday consider this right? As your father he\\nmust.\"\\n\\nAgnes\\'s eyes, leaving Frederick\\'s for a moment, sought her father\\'s.\\nAlas! there was no mistaking their language. Sighing deeply, she again\\nhung her head.\\n\\n\"Too much care for people\\'s opinion,\" she murmured, \"and too little for\\nwhat is best and noblest in us. I do not recognise the necessity of a\\nfarewell between us any more than I recognise that anyone who saw and\\nheard you to-day can believe in your guilt.\"\\n\\n\"But there are so many who did not hear and see me. Besides\" (here he\\nturned a little and pointed to the garden in his rear), \"for the past\\nweek a man--I need not state who, nor under what authority he acts--has\\nbeen in hiding under that arbour, watching my every movement, and almost\\ncounting my sighs. Yesterday he left for a short space, but to-day he is\\nback. What does that argue, dear friend? Innocence, completely\\nrecognised, does not call for such guardianship.\"\\n\\nThe slight frame of the young girl bending so innocently toward him\\nshuddered involuntarily at this, and her eyes, frightened and flashing,\\nswept over the arbour before returning to his face.\\n\\n\"If there is a watcher there, and if such a fact proves you to be in\\ndanger of arrest for a crime you never committed, then it behooves your\\nfriends to show where they stand in this matter, and by lending their\\nsympathy give you courage and power to meet the trials before you.\"\\n\\n\"Not when they are young girls,\" murmured Frederick, and casting a\\nglance at Mr. Halliday, he stepped softly back.\\n\\nAgnes flushed and yielded to her father\\'s gentle pressure. \"Good-bye, my\\nfriend,\" she said, the quiver in her tones sinking deep into Frederick\\'s\\nheart. \"Some day it will be good-morrow,\" and her head, turned back over\\nher shoulder, took on a beautiful radiance that fixed itself forever in\\nthe hungry heart of him who watched it disappear. When she was quite\\ngone, a man not the one whom Frederick had described, as lying in hiding\\nin the arbour, but a different one, in fact, no other than our old\\nfriend the constable--advanced around the corner of the house and\\npresented a paper to him.\\n\\nIt was the warrant for his arrest on a charge of murder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXV\\n\\nSWEETWATER PAYS HIS DEBT AT LAST TO MR. SUTHERLAND\\n\\n\\nFrederick\\'s arrest had been conducted so quietly that no hint of the\\nmatter reached the village before the next morning. Then the whole town\\nbroke into uproar, and business was not only suspended, but the streets\\nand docks overflowed with gesticulating men and excited women, carrying\\non in every corner and across innumerable doorsteps the endless debate\\nwhich such an action on the part of the police necessarily opened.\\n\\nBut the most agitated face, though the stillest tongue, was not to be\\nseen in town that morning, but in a little cottage on an arid hill-slope\\noverlooking the sea. Here Sweetwater sat and communed with his great\\nmonitor, the ocean, and only from his flashing eye and the firm set of\\nhis lips could the mother of Sweetwater see that the crisis of her son\\'s\\nlife was rapidly approaching, and that on the outcome of this long\\nbrooding rested not only his own self-satisfaction, but the interests of\\nthe man most dear to them.\\n\\nSuddenly, from that far horizon upon which Sweetwater\\'s eye rested with\\na look that was almost a demand, came an answer that flushed him with a\\nhope as great as it was unexpected. Bounding to his feet, he confronted\\nhis mother with eager eyes and outstretched hand.\\n\\n\"Give me money, all the money we have in the house. I have an idea that\\nmay be worth all I can ever make or can ever hope to have. If it\\nsucceeds, we save Frederick Sutherland; if it fails, I have only to meet\\nanother of Knapp\\'s scornful looks. But it won\\'t fail; the inspiration\\ncame from the sea, and the sea, you know, is my second mother!\"\\n\\nWhat this inspiration was he did not say, but it carried him presently\\ninto town and landed him in the telegraph office.\\n\\n       .       .       .       .       .       .\\n\\nThe scene later in the day, when Frederick entered the village under the\\nguardianship of the police, was indescribable. Mr. Sutherland had\\ninsisted upon accompanying him, and when the well-loved figure and white\\nhead were recognised, the throng, which had rapidly collected in the\\nthoroughfare leading to the depot, succumbed to the feelings occasioned\\nby this devotion, and fell into a wondering silence.\\n\\nFrederick had never looked better. There is something in the extremity\\nof fate which brings out a man\\'s best characteristics, and this man,\\nhaving much that was good in him, showed it at that moment as never\\nbefore in his short but over-eventful life. As the carriage stopped\\nbefore the court-house on its way to the train, a glimpse was given of\\nhis handsome head to those who had followed him closest, and as there\\nbecame visible for the first time in his face, so altered under his\\ntroubles, a likeness to their beautiful and commanding Agatha, a murmur\\nbroke out around him that was half a wail and half a groan, and which\\naffected him so that he turned from his father, whose hand he was\\nsecretly holding, and taking the whole scene in with one flash of his\\neye, was about to speak, when a sudden hubbub broke out in the direction\\nof the telegraph office, and a man was seen rushing down the street\\nholding a paper high over his head. It was Sweetwater.\\n\\n\"News!\" he cried. \"News! A cablegram from the Azores! A Swedish\\nsailor--\"\\n\\nBut here a man with more authority than the amateur detective pushed his\\nway to the carriage and took off his hat to Mr. Sutherland.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said he, \"but the prisoner will not leave town\\nto-day. Important evidence has just reached us.\"\\n\\nMr. Sutherland saw that it was in Frederick\\'s favour and fainted on his\\nson\\'s neck. As the people beheld his head fall forward, and observed the\\nlook with which Frederick received him in his arms, they broke into a\\ngreat shout.\\n\\n\"News!\" they shrieked. \"News! Frederick Sutherland is innocent! See! the\\nold man has fainted from joy!\" And caps went up and tears fell, before a\\nmother\\'s son of them knew what grounds he had for his enthusiasm.\\n\\nLater, they found they were good and substantial ones. Sweetwater had\\nremembered the group of sailors who had passed by the corner of Agatha\\'s\\nhouse just as Batsy fell forward on the window-sill, and cabling to the\\ncaptain of the vessel, at the first port at which they were likely to\\nput in, was fortunate enough to receive in reply a communication from\\none of the men, who remembered the words she shouted. They were in\\nSwedish and none of his mates had understood them, but he recalled them\\nwell. They were:\\n\\n\"Hjelp! Hjelp! Frun håller på alb döda sig. Hon har en knif. Hjelp!\\nHjelp!\"\\n\\nIn English:\\n\\n\"Help! Help! My mistress kills herself. She has a knife. Help! Help!\"\\n\\nThe impossible had occurred. Batsy was not dead, or at least her\\ntestimony still remained and had come at Sweetwater\\'s beck from the\\nother side of the sea to save her mistress\\'s son.\\n\\n       .       .       .       .       .       .\\n\\nSweetwater was a made man. And Frederick? In a week he was the idol of\\nthe town. In a year--but let Agnes\\'s contented face and happy smile show\\nwhat he was then. Sweet Agnes, who first despised, then encouraged, then\\nloved him, and who, next to Agatha, commanded the open worship of his\\nheart.\\n\\nAgatha is first, must be first, as anyone can see who beholds him, on a\\ncertain anniversary of each year, bury his face in the long grass which\\ncovers the saddest and most passionate heart which ever yielded to the\\npressure of life\\'s deepest tragedy.\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'PROLOGUE\\n\\n\\nUpon a paper attached to the Narrative which follows, Doctor Hesselius\\nhas written a rather elaborate note, which he accompanies with a\\nreference to his Essay on the strange subject which the MS.\\nilluminates.\\n\\nThis mysterious subject he treats, in that Essay, with his usual\\nlearning and acumen, and with remarkable directness and condensation.\\nIt will form but one volume of the series of that extraordinary man’s\\ncollected papers.\\n\\nAs I publish the case, in this volume, simply to interest the “laity,”\\nI shall forestall the intelligent lady, who relates it, in nothing; and\\nafter due consideration, I have determined, therefore, to abstain from\\npresenting any précis of the learned Doctor’s reasoning, or extract\\nfrom his statement on a subject which he describes as “involving, not\\nimprobably, some of the profoundest arcana of our dual existence, and\\nits intermediates.”\\n\\nI was anxious on discovering this paper, to reopen the correspondence\\ncommenced by Doctor Hesselius, so many years before, with a person so\\nclever and careful as his informant seems to have been. Much to my\\nregret, however, I found that she had died in the interval.\\n\\nShe, probably, could have added little to the Narrative which she\\ncommunicates in the following pages, with, so far as I can pronounce,\\nsuch conscientious particularity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI.\\nAn Early Fright\\n\\n\\nIn Styria, we, though by no means magnificent people, inhabit a castle,\\nor schloss. A small income, in that part of the world, goes a great\\nway. Eight or nine hundred a year does wonders. Scantily enough ours\\nwould have answered among wealthy people at home. My father is English,\\nand I bear an English name, although I never saw England. But here, in\\nthis lonely and primitive place, where everything is so marvelously\\ncheap, I really don’t see how ever so much more money would at all\\nmaterially add to our comforts, or even luxuries.\\n\\nMy father was in the Austrian service, and retired upon a pension and\\nhis patrimony, and purchased this feudal residence, and the small\\nestate on which it stands, a bargain.\\n\\nNothing can be more picturesque or solitary. It stands on a slight\\neminence in a forest. The road, very old and narrow, passes in front of\\nits drawbridge, never raised in my time, and its moat, stocked with\\nperch, and sailed over by many swans, and floating on its surface white\\nfleets of water lilies.\\n\\nOver all this the schloss shows its many-windowed front; its towers,\\nand its Gothic chapel.\\n\\nThe forest opens in an irregular and very picturesque glade before its\\ngate, and at the right a steep Gothic bridge carries the road over a\\nstream that winds in deep shadow through the wood. I have said that\\nthis is a very lonely place. Judge whether I say truth. Looking from\\nthe hall door towards the road, the forest in which our castle stands\\nextends fifteen miles to the right, and twelve to the left. The nearest\\ninhabited village is about seven of your English miles to the left. The\\nnearest inhabited schloss of any historic associations, is that of old\\nGeneral Spielsdorf, nearly twenty miles away to the right.\\n\\nI have said “the nearest _inhabited_ village,” because there is, only\\nthree miles westward, that is to say in the direction of General\\nSpielsdorf’s schloss, a ruined village, with its quaint little church,\\nnow roofless, in the aisle of which are the moldering tombs of the\\nproud family of Karnstein, now extinct, who once owned the equally\\ndesolate chateau which, in the thick of the forest, overlooks the\\nsilent ruins of the town.\\n\\nRespecting the cause of the desertion of this striking and melancholy\\nspot, there is a legend which I shall relate to you another time.\\n\\nI must tell you now, how very small is the party who constitute the\\ninhabitants of our castle. I don’t include servants, or those\\ndependents who occupy rooms in the buildings attached to the schloss.\\nListen, and wonder! My father, who is the kindest man on earth, but\\ngrowing old; and I, at the date of my story, only nineteen. Eight years\\nhave passed since then.\\n\\nI and my father constituted the family at the schloss. My mother, a\\nStyrian lady, died in my infancy, but I had a good-natured governess,\\nwho had been with me from, I might almost say, my infancy. I could not\\nremember the time when her fat, benignant face was not a familiar\\npicture in my memory.\\n\\nThis was Madame Perrodon, a native of Berne, whose care and good nature\\nnow in part supplied to me the loss of my mother, whom I do not even\\nremember, so early I lost her. She made a third at our little dinner\\nparty. There was a fourth, Mademoiselle De Lafontaine, a lady such as\\nyou term, I believe, a “finishing governess.” She spoke French and\\nGerman, Madame Perrodon French and broken English, to which my father\\nand I added English, which, partly to prevent its becoming a lost\\nlanguage among us, and partly from patriotic motives, we spoke every\\nday. The consequence was a Babel, at which strangers used to laugh, and\\nwhich I shall make no attempt to reproduce in this narrative. And there\\nwere two or three young lady friends besides, pretty nearly of my own\\nage, who were occasional visitors, for longer or shorter terms; and\\nthese visits I sometimes returned.\\n\\nThese were our regular social resources; but of course there were\\nchance visits from “neighbors” of only five or six leagues distance. My\\nlife was, notwithstanding, rather a solitary one, I can assure you.\\n\\nMy gouvernantes had just so much control over me as you might\\nconjecture such sage persons would have in the case of a rather spoiled\\ngirl, whose only parent allowed her pretty nearly her own way in\\neverything.\\n\\nThe first occurrence in my existence, which produced a terrible\\nimpression upon my mind, which, in fact, never has been effaced, was\\none of the very earliest incidents of my life which I can recollect.\\nSome people will think it so trifling that it should not be recorded\\nhere. You will see, however, by-and-by, why I mention it. The nursery,\\nas it was called, though I had it all to myself, was a large room in\\nthe upper story of the castle, with a steep oak roof. I can’t have been\\nmore than six years old, when one night I awoke, and looking round the\\nroom from my bed, failed to see the nursery maid. Neither was my nurse\\nthere; and I thought myself alone. I was not frightened, for I was one\\nof those happy children who are studiously kept in ignorance of ghost\\nstories, of fairy tales, and of all such lore as makes us cover up our\\nheads when the door cracks suddenly, or the flicker of an expiring\\ncandle makes the shadow of a bedpost dance upon the wall, nearer to our\\nfaces. I was vexed and insulted at finding myself, as I conceived,\\nneglected, and I began to whimper, preparatory to a hearty bout of\\nroaring; when to my surprise, I saw a solemn, but very pretty face\\nlooking at me from the side of the bed. It was that of a young lady who\\nwas kneeling, with her hands under the coverlet. I looked at her with a\\nkind of pleased wonder, and ceased whimpering. She caressed me with her\\nhands, and lay down beside me on the bed, and drew me towards her,\\nsmiling; I felt immediately delightfully soothed, and fell asleep\\nagain. I was wakened by a sensation as if two needles ran into my\\nbreast very deep at the same moment, and I cried loudly. The lady\\nstarted back, with her eyes fixed on me, and then slipped down upon the\\nfloor, and, as I thought, hid herself under the bed.\\n\\nI was now for the first time frightened, and I yelled with all my might\\nand main. Nurse, nursery maid, housekeeper, all came running in, and\\nhearing my story, they made light of it, soothing me all they could\\nmeanwhile. But, child as I was, I could perceive that their faces were\\npale with an unwonted look of anxiety, and I saw them look under the\\nbed, and about the room, and peep under tables and pluck open\\ncupboards; and the housekeeper whispered to the nurse: “Lay your hand\\nalong that hollow in the bed; someone _did_ lie there, so sure as you\\ndid not; the place is still warm.”\\n\\nI remember the nursery maid petting me, and all three examining my\\nchest, where I told them I felt the puncture, and pronouncing that\\nthere was no sign visible that any such thing had happened to me.\\n\\nThe housekeeper and the two other servants who were in charge of the\\nnursery, remained sitting up all night; and from that time a servant\\nalways sat up in the nursery until I was about fourteen.\\n\\nI was very nervous for a long time after this. A doctor was called in,\\nhe was pallid and elderly. How well I remember his long saturnine face,\\nslightly pitted with smallpox, and his chestnut wig. For a good while,\\nevery second day, he came and gave me medicine, which of course I\\nhated.\\n\\nThe morning after I saw this apparition I was in a state of terror, and\\ncould not bear to be left alone, daylight though it was, for a moment.\\n\\nI remember my father coming up and standing at the bedside, and talking\\ncheerfully, and asking the nurse a number of questions, and laughing\\nvery heartily at one of the answers; and patting me on the shoulder,\\nand kissing me, and telling me not to be frightened, that it was\\nnothing but a dream and could not hurt me.\\n\\nBut I was not comforted, for I knew the visit of the strange woman was\\n_not_ a dream; and I was _awfully_ frightened.\\n\\nI was a little consoled by the nursery maid’s assuring me that it was\\nshe who had come and looked at me, and lain down beside me in the bed,\\nand that I must have been half-dreaming not to have known her face. But\\nthis, though supported by the nurse, did not quite satisfy me.\\n\\nI remembered, in the course of that day, a venerable old man, in a\\nblack cassock, coming into the room with the nurse and housekeeper, and\\ntalking a little to them, and very kindly to me; his face was very\\nsweet and gentle, and he told me they were going to pray, and joined my\\nhands together, and desired me to say, softly, while they were praying,\\n“Lord hear all good prayers for us, for Jesus’ sake.” I think these\\nwere the very words, for I often repeated them to myself, and my nurse\\nused for years to make me say them in my prayers.\\n\\nI remembered so well the thoughtful sweet face of that white-haired old\\nman, in his black cassock, as he stood in that rude, lofty, brown room,\\nwith the clumsy furniture of a fashion three hundred years old about\\nhim, and the scanty light entering its shadowy atmosphere through the\\nsmall lattice. He kneeled, and the three women with him, and he prayed\\naloud with an earnest quavering voice for, what appeared to me, a long\\ntime. I forget all my life preceding that event, and for some time\\nafter it is all obscure also, but the scenes I have just described\\nstand out vivid as the isolated pictures of the phantasmagoria\\nsurrounded by darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII.\\nA Guest\\n\\n\\nI am now going to tell you something so strange that it will require\\nall your faith in my veracity to believe my story. It is not only true,\\nnevertheless, but truth of which I have been an eyewitness.\\n\\nIt was a sweet summer evening, and my father asked me, as he sometimes\\ndid, to take a little ramble with him along that beautiful forest vista\\nwhich I have mentioned as lying in front of the schloss.\\n\\n“General Spielsdorf cannot come to us so soon as I had hoped,” said my\\nfather, as we pursued our walk.\\n\\nHe was to have paid us a visit of some weeks, and we had expected his\\narrival next day. He was to have brought with him a young lady, his\\nniece and ward, Mademoiselle Rheinfeldt, whom I had never seen, but\\nwhom I had heard described as a very charming girl, and in whose\\nsociety I had promised myself many happy days. I was more disappointed\\nthan a young lady living in a town, or a bustling neighborhood can\\npossibly imagine. This visit, and the new acquaintance it promised, had\\nfurnished my day dream for many weeks.\\n\\n“And how soon does he come?” I asked.\\n\\n“Not till autumn. Not for two months, I dare say,” he answered. “And I\\nam very glad now, dear, that you never knew Mademoiselle Rheinfeldt.”\\n\\n“And why?” I asked, both mortified and curious.\\n\\n“Because the poor young lady is dead,” he replied. “I quite forgot I\\nhad not told you, but you were not in the room when I received the\\nGeneral’s letter this evening.”\\n\\nI was very much shocked. General Spielsdorf had mentioned in his first\\nletter, six or seven weeks before, that she was not so well as he would\\nwish her, but there was nothing to suggest the remotest suspicion of\\ndanger.\\n\\n“Here is the General’s letter,” he said, handing it to me. “I am afraid\\nhe is in great affliction; the letter appears to me to have been\\nwritten very nearly in distraction.”\\n\\nWe sat down on a rude bench, under a group of magnificent lime trees.\\nThe sun was setting with all its melancholy splendor behind the sylvan\\nhorizon, and the stream that flows beside our home, and passes under\\nthe steep old bridge I have mentioned, wound through many a group of\\nnoble trees, almost at our feet, reflecting in its current the fading\\ncrimson of the sky. General Spielsdorf’s letter was so extraordinary,\\nso vehement, and in some places so self-contradictory, that I read it\\ntwice over—the second time aloud to my father—and was still unable to\\naccount for it, except by supposing that grief had unsettled his mind.\\n\\nIt said “I have lost my darling daughter, for as such I loved her.\\nDuring the last days of dear Bertha’s illness I was not able to write\\nto you.\\n\\nBefore then I had no idea of her danger. I have lost her, and now learn\\n_all_, too late. She died in the peace of innocence, and in the\\nglorious hope of a blessed futurity. The fiend who betrayed our\\ninfatuated hospitality has done it all. I thought I was receiving into\\nmy house innocence, gaiety, a charming companion for my lost Bertha.\\nHeavens! what a fool have I been!\\n\\nI thank God my child died without a suspicion of the cause of her\\nsufferings. She is gone without so much as conjecturing the nature of\\nher illness, and the accursed passion of the agent of all this misery.\\nI devote my remaining days to tracking and extinguishing a monster. I\\nam told I may hope to accomplish my righteous and merciful purpose. At\\npresent there is scarcely a gleam of light to guide me. I curse my\\nconceited incredulity, my despicable affectation of superiority, my\\nblindness, my obstinacy—all—too late. I cannot write or talk\\ncollectedly now. I am distracted. So soon as I shall have a little\\nrecovered, I mean to devote myself for a time to enquiry, which may\\npossibly lead me as far as Vienna. Some time in the autumn, two months\\nhence, or earlier if I live, I will see you—that is, if you permit me;\\nI will then tell you all that I scarce dare put upon paper now.\\nFarewell. Pray for me, dear friend.”\\n\\nIn these terms ended this strange letter. Though I had never seen\\nBertha Rheinfeldt my eyes filled with tears at the sudden intelligence;\\nI was startled, as well as profoundly disappointed.\\n\\nThe sun had now set, and it was twilight by the time I had returned the\\nGeneral’s letter to my father.\\n\\nIt was a soft clear evening, and we loitered, speculating upon the\\npossible meanings of the violent and incoherent sentences which I had\\njust been reading. We had nearly a mile to walk before reaching the\\nroad that passes the schloss in front, and by that time the moon was\\nshining brilliantly. At the drawbridge we met Madame Perrodon and\\nMademoiselle De Lafontaine, who had come out, without their bonnets, to\\nenjoy the exquisite moonlight.\\n\\nWe heard their voices gabbling in animated dialogue as we approached.\\nWe joined them at the drawbridge, and turned about to admire with them\\nthe beautiful scene.\\n\\nThe glade through which we had just walked lay before us. At our left\\nthe narrow road wound away under clumps of lordly trees, and was lost\\nto sight amid the thickening forest. At the right the same road crosses\\nthe steep and picturesque bridge, near which stands a ruined tower\\nwhich once guarded that pass; and beyond the bridge an abrupt eminence\\nrises, covered with trees, and showing in the shadows some grey\\nivy-clustered rocks.\\n\\nOver the sward and low grounds a thin film of mist was stealing like\\nsmoke, marking the distances with a transparent veil; and here and\\nthere we could see the river faintly flashing in the moonlight.\\n\\nNo softer, sweeter scene could be imagined. The news I had just heard\\nmade it melancholy; but nothing could disturb its character of profound\\nserenity, and the enchanted glory and vagueness of the prospect.\\n\\nMy father, who enjoyed the picturesque, and I, stood looking in silence\\nover the expanse beneath us. The two good governesses, standing a\\nlittle way behind us, discoursed upon the scene, and were eloquent upon\\nthe moon.\\n\\nMadame Perrodon was fat, middle-aged, and romantic, and talked and\\nsighed poetically. Mademoiselle De Lafontaine—in right of her father\\nwho was a German, assumed to be psychological, metaphysical, and\\nsomething of a mystic—now declared that when the moon shone with a\\nlight so intense it was well known that it indicated a special\\nspiritual activity. The effect of the full moon in such a state of\\nbrilliancy was manifold. It acted on dreams, it acted on lunacy, it\\nacted on nervous people, it had marvelous physical influences connected\\nwith life. Mademoiselle related that her cousin, who was mate of a\\nmerchant ship, having taken a nap on deck on such a night, lying on his\\nback, with his face full in the light on the moon, had wakened, after a\\ndream of an old woman clawing him by the cheek, with his features\\nhorribly drawn to one side; and his countenance had never quite\\nrecovered its equilibrium.\\n\\n“The moon, this night,” she said, “is full of idyllic and magnetic\\ninfluence—and see, when you look behind you at the front of the schloss\\nhow all its windows flash and twinkle with that silvery splendor, as if\\nunseen hands had lighted up the rooms to receive fairy guests.”\\n\\nThere are indolent styles of the spirits in which, indisposed to talk\\nourselves, the talk of others is pleasant to our listless ears; and I\\ngazed on, pleased with the tinkle of the ladies’ conversation.\\n\\n“I have got into one of my moping moods tonight,” said my father, after\\na silence, and quoting Shakespeare, whom, by way of keeping up our\\nEnglish, he used to read aloud, he said:\\n\\n“‘In truth I know not why I am so sad.\\nIt wearies me: you say it wearies you;\\nBut how I got it—came by it.’\\n\\n\\n“I forget the rest. But I feel as if some great misfortune were hanging\\nover us. I suppose the poor General’s afflicted letter has had\\nsomething to do with it.”\\n\\nAt this moment the unwonted sound of carriage wheels and many hoofs\\nupon the road, arrested our attention.\\n\\nThey seemed to be approaching from the high ground overlooking the\\nbridge, and very soon the equipage emerged from that point. Two\\nhorsemen first crossed the bridge, then came a carriage drawn by four\\nhorses, and two men rode behind.\\n\\nIt seemed to be the traveling carriage of a person of rank; and we were\\nall immediately absorbed in watching that very unusual spectacle. It\\nbecame, in a few moments, greatly more interesting, for just as the\\ncarriage had passed the summit of the steep bridge, one of the leaders,\\ntaking fright, communicated his panic to the rest, and after a plunge\\nor two, the whole team broke into a wild gallop together, and dashing\\nbetween the horsemen who rode in front, came thundering along the road\\ntowards us with the speed of a hurricane.\\n\\nThe excitement of the scene was made more painful by the clear,\\nlong-drawn screams of a female voice from the carriage window.\\n\\nWe all advanced in curiosity and horror; me rather in silence, the rest\\nwith various ejaculations of terror.\\n\\nOur suspense did not last long. Just before you reach the castle\\ndrawbridge, on the route they were coming, there stands by the roadside\\na magnificent lime tree, on the other stands an ancient stone cross, at\\nsight of which the horses, now going at a pace that was perfectly\\nfrightful, swerved so as to bring the wheel over the projecting roots\\nof the tree.\\n\\nI knew what was coming. I covered my eyes, unable to see it out, and\\nturned my head away; at the same moment I heard a cry from my lady\\nfriends, who had gone on a little.\\n\\nCuriosity opened my eyes, and I saw a scene of utter confusion. Two of\\nthe horses were on the ground, the carriage lay upon its side with two\\nwheels in the air; the men were busy removing the traces, and a lady\\nwith a commanding air and figure had got out, and stood with clasped\\nhands, raising the handkerchief that was in them every now and then to\\nher eyes.\\n\\nThrough the carriage door was now lifted a young lady, who appeared to\\nbe lifeless. My dear old father was already beside the elder lady, with\\nhis hat in his hand, evidently tendering his aid and the resources of\\nhis schloss. The lady did not appear to hear him, or to have eyes for\\nanything but the slender girl who was being placed against the slope of\\nthe bank.\\n\\nI approached; the young lady was apparently stunned, but she was\\ncertainly not dead. My father, who piqued himself on being something of\\na physician, had just had his fingers on her wrist and assured the\\nlady, who declared herself her mother, that her pulse, though faint and\\nirregular, was undoubtedly still distinguishable. The lady clasped her\\nhands and looked upward, as if in a momentary transport of gratitude;\\nbut immediately she broke out again in that theatrical way which is, I\\nbelieve, natural to some people.\\n\\nShe was what is called a fine looking woman for her time of life, and\\nmust have been handsome; she was tall, but not thin, and dressed in\\nblack velvet, and looked rather pale, but with a proud and commanding\\ncountenance, though now agitated strangely.\\n\\n“Who was ever being so born to calamity?” I heard her say, with clasped\\nhands, as I came up. “Here am I, on a journey of life and death, in\\nprosecuting which to lose an hour is possibly to lose all. My child\\nwill not have recovered sufficiently to resume her route for who can\\nsay how long. I must leave her: I cannot, dare not, delay. How far on,\\nsir, can you tell, is the nearest village? I must leave her there; and\\nshall not see my darling, or even hear of her till my return, three\\nmonths hence.”\\n\\nI plucked my father by the coat, and whispered earnestly in his ear:\\n“Oh! papa, pray ask her to let her stay with us—it would be so\\ndelightful. Do, pray.”\\n\\n“If Madame will entrust her child to the care of my daughter, and of\\nher good gouvernante, Madame Perrodon, and permit her to remain as our\\nguest, under my charge, until her return, it will confer a distinction\\nand an obligation upon us, and we shall treat her with all the care and\\ndevotion which so sacred a trust deserves.”\\n\\n“I cannot do that, sir, it would be to task your kindness and chivalry\\ntoo cruelly,” said the lady, distractedly.\\n\\n“It would, on the contrary, be to confer on us a very great kindness at\\nthe moment when we most need it. My daughter has just been disappointed\\nby a cruel misfortune, in a visit from which she had long anticipated a\\ngreat deal of happiness. If you confide this young lady to our care it\\nwill be her best consolation. The nearest village on your route is\\ndistant, and affords no such inn as you could think of placing your\\ndaughter at; you cannot allow her to continue her journey for any\\nconsiderable distance without danger. If, as you say, you cannot\\nsuspend your journey, you must part with her tonight, and nowhere could\\nyou do so with more honest assurances of care and tenderness than\\nhere.”\\n\\nThere was something in this lady’s air and appearance so distinguished\\nand even imposing, and in her manner so engaging, as to impress one,\\nquite apart from the dignity of her equipage, with a conviction that\\nshe was a person of consequence.\\n\\nBy this time the carriage was replaced in its upright position, and the\\nhorses, quite tractable, in the traces again.\\n\\nThe lady threw on her daughter a glance which I fancied was not quite\\nso affectionate as one might have anticipated from the beginning of the\\nscene; then she beckoned slightly to my father, and withdrew two or\\nthree steps with him out of hearing; and talked to him with a fixed and\\nstern countenance, not at all like that with which she had hitherto\\nspoken.\\n\\nI was filled with wonder that my father did not seem to perceive the\\nchange, and also unspeakably curious to learn what it could be that she\\nwas speaking, almost in his ear, with so much earnestness and rapidity.\\n\\nTwo or three minutes at most I think she remained thus employed, then\\nshe turned, and a few steps brought her to where her daughter lay,\\nsupported by Madame Perrodon. She kneeled beside her for a moment and\\nwhispered, as Madame supposed, a little benediction in her ear; then\\nhastily kissing her she stepped into her carriage, the door was closed,\\nthe footmen in stately liveries jumped up behind, the outriders spurred\\non, the postilions cracked their whips, the horses plunged and broke\\nsuddenly into a furious canter that threatened soon again to become a\\ngallop, and the carriage whirled away, followed at the same rapid pace\\nby the two horsemen in the rear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII.\\nWe Compare Notes\\n\\n\\nWe followed the _cortege_ with our eyes until it was swiftly lost to\\nsight in the misty wood; and the very sound of the hoofs and the wheels\\ndied away in the silent night air.\\n\\nNothing remained to assure us that the adventure had not been an\\nillusion of a moment but the young lady, who just at that moment opened\\nher eyes. I could not see, for her face was turned from me, but she\\nraised her head, evidently looking about her, and I heard a very sweet\\nvoice ask complainingly, “Where is mamma?”\\n\\nOur good Madame Perrodon answered tenderly, and added some comfortable\\nassurances.\\n\\nI then heard her ask:\\n\\n“Where am I? What is this place?” and after that she said, “I don’t see\\nthe carriage; and Matska, where is she?”\\n\\nMadame answered all her questions in so far as she understood them; and\\ngradually the young lady remembered how the misadventure came about,\\nand was glad to hear that no one in, or in attendance on, the carriage\\nwas hurt; and on learning that her mamma had left her here, till her\\nreturn in about three months, she wept.\\n\\nI was going to add my consolations to those of Madame Perrodon when\\nMademoiselle De Lafontaine placed her hand upon my arm, saying:\\n\\n“Don’t approach, one at a time is as much as she can at present\\nconverse with; a very little excitement would possibly overpower her\\nnow.”\\n\\nAs soon as she is comfortably in bed, I thought, I will run up to her\\nroom and see her.\\n\\nMy father in the meantime had sent a servant on horseback for the\\nphysician, who lived about two leagues away; and a bedroom was being\\nprepared for the young lady’s reception.\\n\\nThe stranger now rose, and leaning on Madame’s arm, walked slowly over\\nthe drawbridge and into the castle gate.\\n\\nIn the hall, servants waited to receive her, and she was conducted\\nforthwith to her room. The room we usually sat in as our drawing room\\nis long, having four windows, that looked over the moat and drawbridge,\\nupon the forest scene I have just described.\\n\\nIt is furnished in old carved oak, with large carved cabinets, and the\\nchairs are cushioned with crimson Utrecht velvet. The walls are covered\\nwith tapestry, and surrounded with great gold frames, the figures being\\nas large as life, in ancient and very curious costume, and the subjects\\nrepresented are hunting, hawking, and generally festive. It is not too\\nstately to be extremely comfortable; and here we had our tea, for with\\nhis usual patriotic leanings he insisted that the national beverage\\nshould make its appearance regularly with our coffee and chocolate.\\n\\nWe sat here this night, and with candles lighted, were talking over the\\nadventure of the evening.\\n\\nMadame Perrodon and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine were both of our party.\\nThe young stranger had hardly lain down in her bed when she sank into a\\ndeep sleep; and those ladies had left her in the care of a servant.\\n\\n“How do you like our guest?” I asked, as soon as Madame entered. “Tell\\nme all about her?”\\n\\n“I like her extremely,” answered Madame, “she is, I almost think, the\\nprettiest creature I ever saw; about your age, and so gentle and nice.”\\n\\n“She is absolutely beautiful,” threw in Mademoiselle, who had peeped\\nfor a moment into the stranger’s room.\\n\\n“And such a sweet voice!” added Madame Perrodon.\\n\\n“Did you remark a woman in the carriage, after it was set up again, who\\ndid not get out,” inquired Mademoiselle, “but only looked from the\\nwindow?”\\n\\n“No, we had not seen her.”\\n\\nThen she described a hideous black woman, with a sort of colored turban\\non her head, and who was gazing all the time from the carriage window,\\nnodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with gleaming eyes\\nand large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in fury.\\n\\n“Did you remark what an ill-looking pack of men the servants were?”\\nasked Madame.\\n\\n“Yes,” said my father, who had just come in, “ugly, hang-dog looking\\nfellows as ever I beheld in my life. I hope they mayn’t rob the poor\\nlady in the forest. They are clever rogues, however; they got\\neverything to rights in a minute.”\\n\\n“I dare say they are worn out with too long traveling,” said Madame.\\n\\n“Besides looking wicked, their faces were so strangely lean, and dark,\\nand sullen. I am very curious, I own; but I dare say the young lady\\nwill tell you all about it tomorrow, if she is sufficiently recovered.”\\n\\n“I don’t think she will,” said my father, with a mysterious smile, and\\na little nod of his head, as if he knew more about it than he cared to\\ntell us.\\n\\nThis made us all the more inquisitive as to what had passed between him\\nand the lady in the black velvet, in the brief but earnest interview\\nthat had immediately preceded her departure.\\n\\nWe were scarcely alone, when I entreated him to tell me. He did not\\nneed much pressing.\\n\\n“There is no particular reason why I should not tell you. She expressed\\na reluctance to trouble us with the care of her daughter, saying she\\nwas in delicate health, and nervous, but not subject to any kind of\\nseizure—she volunteered that—nor to any illusion; being, in fact,\\nperfectly sane.”\\n\\n“How very odd to say all that!” I interpolated. “It was so\\nunnecessary.”\\n\\n“At all events it _was_ said,” he laughed, “and as you wish to know all\\nthat passed, which was indeed very little, I tell you. She then said,\\n‘I am making a long journey of _vital_ importance—she emphasized the\\nword—rapid and secret; I shall return for my child in three months; in\\nthe meantime, she will be silent as to who we are, whence we come, and\\nwhither we are traveling.’ That is all she said. She spoke very pure\\nFrench. When she said the word ‘secret,’ she paused for a few seconds,\\nlooking sternly, her eyes fixed on mine. I fancy she makes a great\\npoint of that. You saw how quickly she was gone. I hope I have not done\\na very foolish thing, in taking charge of the young lady.”\\n\\nFor my part, I was delighted. I was longing to see and talk to her; and\\nonly waiting till the doctor should give me leave. You, who live in\\ntowns, can have no idea how great an event the introduction of a new\\nfriend is, in such a solitude as surrounded us.\\n\\nThe doctor did not arrive till nearly one o’clock; but I could no more\\nhave gone to my bed and slept, than I could have overtaken, on foot,\\nthe carriage in which the princess in black velvet had driven away.\\n\\nWhen the physician came down to the drawing room, it was to report very\\nfavorably upon his patient. She was now sitting up, her pulse quite\\nregular, apparently perfectly well. She had sustained no injury, and\\nthe little shock to her nerves had passed away quite harmlessly. There\\ncould be no harm certainly in my seeing her, if we both wished it; and,\\nwith this permission I sent, forthwith, to know whether she would allow\\nme to visit her for a few minutes in her room.\\n\\nThe servant returned immediately to say that she desired nothing more.\\n\\nYou may be sure I was not long in availing myself of this permission.\\n\\nOur visitor lay in one of the handsomest rooms in the schloss. It was,\\nperhaps, a little stately. There was a somber piece of tapestry\\nopposite the foot of the bed, representing Cleopatra with the asps to\\nher bosom; and other solemn classic scenes were displayed, a little\\nfaded, upon the other walls. But there was gold carving, and rich and\\nvaried color enough in the other decorations of the room, to more than\\nredeem the gloom of the old tapestry.\\n\\nThere were candles at the bedside. She was sitting up; her slender\\npretty figure enveloped in the soft silk dressing gown, embroidered\\nwith flowers, and lined with thick quilted silk, which her mother had\\nthrown over her feet as she lay upon the ground.\\n\\nWhat was it that, as I reached the bedside and had just begun my little\\ngreeting, struck me dumb in a moment, and made me recoil a step or two\\nfrom before her? I will tell you.\\n\\nI saw the very face which had visited me in my childhood at night,\\nwhich remained so fixed in my memory, and on which I had for so many\\nyears so often ruminated with horror, when no one suspected of what I\\nwas thinking.\\n\\nIt was pretty, even beautiful; and when I first beheld it, wore the\\nsame melancholy expression.\\n\\nBut this almost instantly lighted into a strange fixed smile of\\nrecognition.\\n\\nThere was a silence of fully a minute, and then at length she spoke; I\\ncould not.\\n\\n“How wonderful!” she exclaimed. “Twelve years ago, I saw your face in a\\ndream, and it has haunted me ever since.”\\n\\n“Wonderful indeed!” I repeated, overcoming with an effort the horror\\nthat had for a time suspended my utterances. “Twelve years ago, in\\nvision or reality, I certainly saw you. I could not forget your face.\\nIt has remained before my eyes ever since.”\\n\\nHer smile had softened. Whatever I had fancied strange in it, was gone,\\nand it and her dimpling cheeks were now delightfully pretty and\\nintelligent.\\n\\nI felt reassured, and continued more in the vein which hospitality\\nindicated, to bid her welcome, and to tell her how much pleasure her\\naccidental arrival had given us all, and especially what a happiness it\\nwas to me.\\n\\nI took her hand as I spoke. I was a little shy, as lonely people are,\\nbut the situation made me eloquent, and even bold. She pressed my hand,\\nshe laid hers upon it, and her eyes glowed, as, looking hastily into\\nmine, she smiled again, and blushed.\\n\\nShe answered my welcome very prettily. I sat down beside her, still\\nwondering; and she said:\\n\\n“I must tell you my vision about you; it is so very strange that you\\nand I should have had, each of the other so vivid a dream, that each\\nshould have seen, I you and you me, looking as we do now, when of\\ncourse we both were mere children. I was a child, about six years old,\\nand I awoke from a confused and troubled dream, and found myself in a\\nroom, unlike my nursery, wainscoted clumsily in some dark wood, and\\nwith cupboards and bedsteads, and chairs, and benches placed about it.\\nThe beds were, I thought, all empty, and the room itself without anyone\\nbut myself in it; and I, after looking about me for some time, and\\nadmiring especially an iron candlestick with two branches, which I\\nshould certainly know again, crept under one of the beds to reach the\\nwindow; but as I got from under the bed, I heard someone crying; and\\nlooking up, while I was still upon my knees, I saw you—most assuredly\\nyou—as I see you now; a beautiful young lady, with golden hair and\\nlarge blue eyes, and lips—your lips—you as you are here.\\n\\n“Your looks won me; I climbed on the bed and put my arms about you, and\\nI think we both fell asleep. I was aroused by a scream; you were\\nsitting up screaming. I was frightened, and slipped down upon the\\nground, and, it seemed to me, lost consciousness for a moment; and when\\nI came to myself, I was again in my nursery at home. Your face I have\\nnever forgotten since. I could not be misled by mere resemblance. _You\\nare_ the lady whom I saw then.”\\n\\nIt was now my turn to relate my corresponding vision, which I did, to\\nthe undisguised wonder of my new acquaintance.\\n\\n“I don’t know which should be most afraid of the other,” she said,\\nagain smiling—“If you were less pretty I think I should be very much\\nafraid of you, but being as you are, and you and I both so young, I\\nfeel only that I have made your acquaintance twelve years ago, and have\\nalready a right to your intimacy; at all events it does seem as if we\\nwere destined, from our earliest childhood, to be friends. I wonder\\nwhether you feel as strangely drawn towards me as I do to you; I have\\nnever had a friend—shall I find one now?” She sighed, and her fine dark\\neyes gazed passionately on me.\\n\\nNow the truth is, I felt rather unaccountably towards the beautiful\\nstranger. I did feel, as she said, “drawn towards her,” but there was\\nalso something of repulsion. In this ambiguous feeling, however, the\\nsense of attraction immensely prevailed. She interested and won me; she\\nwas so beautiful and so indescribably engaging.\\n\\nI perceived now something of languor and exhaustion stealing over her,\\nand hastened to bid her good night.\\n\\n“The doctor thinks,” I added, “that you ought to have a maid to sit up\\nwith you tonight; one of ours is waiting, and you will find her a very\\nuseful and quiet creature.”\\n\\n“How kind of you, but I could not sleep, I never could with an\\nattendant in the room. I shan’t require any assistance—and, shall I\\nconfess my weakness, I am haunted with a terror of robbers. Our house\\nwas robbed once, and two servants murdered, so I always lock my door.\\nIt has become a habit—and you look so kind I know you will forgive me.\\nI see there is a key in the lock.”\\n\\nShe held me close in her pretty arms for a moment and whispered in my\\near, “Good night, darling, it is very hard to part with you, but good\\nnight; tomorrow, but not early, I shall see you again.”\\n\\nShe sank back on the pillow with a sigh, and her fine eyes followed me\\nwith a fond and melancholy gaze, and she murmured again “Good night,\\ndear friend.”\\n\\nYoung people like, and even love, on impulse. I was flattered by the\\nevident, though as yet undeserved, fondness she showed me. I liked the\\nconfidence with which she at once received me. She was determined that\\nwe should be very near friends.\\n\\nNext day came and we met again. I was delighted with my companion; that\\nis to say, in many respects.\\n\\nHer looks lost nothing in daylight—she was certainly the most beautiful\\ncreature I had ever seen, and the unpleasant remembrance of the face\\npresented in my early dream, had lost the effect of the first\\nunexpected recognition.\\n\\nShe confessed that she had experienced a similar shock on seeing me,\\nand precisely the same faint antipathy that had mingled with my\\nadmiration of her. We now laughed together over our momentary horrors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV.\\nHer Habits—A Saunter\\n\\n\\nI told you that I was charmed with her in most particulars.\\n\\nThere were some that did not please me so well.\\n\\nShe was above the middle height of women. I shall begin by describing\\nher.\\n\\nShe was slender, and wonderfully graceful. Except that her movements\\nwere languid—very languid—indeed, there was nothing in her appearance\\nto indicate an invalid. Her complexion was rich and brilliant; her\\nfeatures were small and beautifully formed; her eyes large, dark, and\\nlustrous; her hair was quite wonderful, I never saw hair so\\nmagnificently thick and long when it was down about her shoulders; I\\nhave often placed my hands under it, and laughed with wonder at its\\nweight. It was exquisitely fine and soft, and in color a rich very dark\\nbrown, with something of gold. I loved to let it down, tumbling with\\nits own weight, as, in her room, she lay back in her chair talking in\\nher sweet low voice, I used to fold and braid it, and spread it out and\\nplay with it. Heavens! If I had but known all!\\n\\nI said there were particulars which did not please me. I have told you\\nthat her confidence won me the first night I saw her; but I found that\\nshe exercised with respect to herself, her mother, her history,\\neverything in fact connected with her life, plans, and people, an ever\\nwakeful reserve. I dare say I was unreasonable, perhaps I was wrong; I\\ndare say I ought to have respected the solemn injunction laid upon my\\nfather by the stately lady in black velvet. But curiosity is a restless\\nand unscrupulous passion, and no one girl can endure, with patience,\\nthat hers should be baffled by another. What harm could it do anyone to\\ntell me what I so ardently desired to know? Had she no trust in my good\\nsense or honor? Why would she not believe me when I assured her, so\\nsolemnly, that I would not divulge one syllable of what she told me to\\nany mortal breathing.\\n\\nThere was a coldness, it seemed to me, beyond her years, in her smiling\\nmelancholy persistent refusal to afford me the least ray of light.\\n\\nI cannot say we quarreled upon this point, for she would not quarrel\\nupon any. It was, of course, very unfair of me to press her, very\\nill-bred, but I really could not help it; and I might just as well have\\nlet it alone.\\n\\nWhat she did tell me amounted, in my unconscionable estimation—to\\nnothing.\\n\\nIt was all summed up in three very vague disclosures:\\n\\nFirst—Her name was Carmilla.\\n\\nSecond—Her family was very ancient and noble.\\n\\nThird—Her home lay in the direction of the west.\\n\\nShe would not tell me the name of her family, nor their armorial\\nbearings, nor the name of their estate, nor even that of the country\\nthey lived in.\\n\\nYou are not to suppose that I worried her incessantly on these\\nsubjects. I watched opportunity, and rather insinuated than urged my\\ninquiries. Once or twice, indeed, I did attack her more directly. But\\nno matter what my tactics, utter failure was invariably the result.\\nReproaches and caresses were all lost upon her. But I must add this,\\nthat her evasion was conducted with so pretty a melancholy and\\ndeprecation, with so many, and even passionate declarations of her\\nliking for me, and trust in my honor, and with so many promises that I\\nshould at last know all, that I could not find it in my heart long to\\nbe offended with her.\\n\\nShe used to place her pretty arms about my neck, draw me to her, and\\nlaying her cheek to mine, murmur with her lips near my ear, “Dearest,\\nyour little heart is wounded; think me not cruel because I obey the\\nirresistible law of my strength and weakness; if your dear heart is\\nwounded, my wild heart bleeds with yours. In the rapture of my enormous\\nhumiliation I live in your warm life, and you shall die—die, sweetly\\ndie—into mine. I cannot help it; as I draw near to you, you, in your\\nturn, will draw near to others, and learn the rapture of that cruelty,\\nwhich yet is love; so, for a while, seek to know no more of me and\\nmine, but trust me with all your loving spirit.”\\n\\nAnd when she had spoken such a rhapsody, she would press me more\\nclosely in her trembling embrace, and her lips in soft kisses gently\\nglow upon my cheek.\\n\\nHer agitations and her language were unintelligible to me.\\n\\nFrom these foolish embraces, which were not of very frequent\\noccurrence, I must allow, I used to wish to extricate myself; but my\\nenergies seemed to fail me. Her murmured words sounded like a lullaby\\nin my ear, and soothed my resistance into a trance, from which I only\\nseemed to recover myself when she withdrew her arms.\\n\\nIn these mysterious moods I did not like her. I experienced a strange\\ntumultuous excitement that was pleasurable, ever and anon, mingled with\\na vague sense of fear and disgust. I had no distinct thoughts about her\\nwhile such scenes lasted, but I was conscious of a love growing into\\nadoration, and also of abhorrence. This I know is paradox, but I can\\nmake no other attempt to explain the feeling.\\n\\nI now write, after an interval of more than ten years, with a trembling\\nhand, with a confused and horrible recollection of certain occurrences\\nand situations, in the ordeal through which I was unconsciously\\npassing; though with a vivid and very sharp remembrance of the main\\ncurrent of my story.\\n\\nBut, I suspect, in all lives there are certain emotional scenes, those\\nin which our passions have been most wildly and terribly roused, that\\nare of all others the most vaguely and dimly remembered.\\n\\nSometimes after an hour of apathy, my strange and beautiful companion\\nwould take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and\\nagain; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning\\neyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the\\ntumultuous respiration. It was like the ardor of a lover; it\\nembarrassed me; it was hateful and yet over-powering; and with gloating\\neyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips traveled along my cheek in\\nkisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, “You are mine, you\\n_shall_ be mine, you and I are one for ever.” Then she had thrown\\nherself back in her chair, with her small hands over her eyes, leaving\\nme trembling.\\n\\n“Are we related,” I used to ask; “what can you mean by all this? I\\nremind you perhaps of someone whom you love; but you must not, I hate\\nit; I don’t know you—I don’t know myself when you look so and talk so.”\\n\\nShe used to sigh at my vehemence, then turn away and drop my hand.\\n\\nRespecting these very extraordinary manifestations I strove in vain to\\nform any satisfactory theory—I could not refer them to affectation or\\ntrick. It was unmistakably the momentary breaking out of suppressed\\ninstinct and emotion. Was she, notwithstanding her mother’s volunteered\\ndenial, subject to brief visitations of insanity; or was there here a\\ndisguise and a romance? I had read in old storybooks of such things.\\nWhat if a boyish lover had found his way into the house, and sought to\\nprosecute his suit in masquerade, with the assistance of a clever old\\nadventuress. But there were many things against this hypothesis, highly\\ninteresting as it was to my vanity.\\n\\nI could boast of no little attentions such as masculine gallantry\\ndelights to offer. Between these passionate moments there were long\\nintervals of commonplace, of gaiety, of brooding melancholy, during\\nwhich, except that I detected her eyes so full of melancholy fire,\\nfollowing me, at times I might have been as nothing to her. Except in\\nthese brief periods of mysterious excitement her ways were girlish; and\\nthere was always a languor about her, quite incompatible with a\\nmasculine system in a state of health.\\n\\nIn some respects her habits were odd. Perhaps not so singular in the\\nopinion of a town lady like you, as they appeared to us rustic people.\\nShe used to come down very late, generally not till one o’clock, she\\nwould then take a cup of chocolate, but eat nothing; we then went out\\nfor a walk, which was a mere saunter, and she seemed, almost\\nimmediately, exhausted, and either returned to the schloss or sat on\\none of the benches that were placed, here and there, among the trees.\\nThis was a bodily languor in which her mind did not sympathize. She was\\nalways an animated talker, and very intelligent.\\n\\nShe sometimes alluded for a moment to her own home, or mentioned an\\nadventure or situation, or an early recollection, which indicated a\\npeople of strange manners, and described customs of which we knew\\nnothing. I gathered from these chance hints that her native country was\\nmuch more remote than I had at first fancied.\\n\\nAs we sat thus one afternoon under the trees a funeral passed us by. It\\nwas that of a pretty young girl, whom I had often seen, the daughter of\\none of the rangers of the forest. The poor man was walking behind the\\ncoffin of his darling; she was his only child, and he looked quite\\nheartbroken.\\n\\nPeasants walking two-and-two came behind, they were singing a funeral\\nhymn.\\n\\nI rose to mark my respect as they passed, and joined in the hymn they\\nwere very sweetly singing.\\n\\nMy companion shook me a little roughly, and I turned surprised.\\n\\nShe said brusquely, “Don’t you perceive how discordant that is?”\\n\\n“I think it very sweet, on the contrary,” I answered, vexed at the\\ninterruption, and very uncomfortable, lest the people who composed the\\nlittle procession should observe and resent what was passing.\\n\\nI resumed, therefore, instantly, and was again interrupted. “You pierce\\nmy ears,” said Carmilla, almost angrily, and stopping her ears with her\\ntiny fingers. “Besides, how can you tell that your religion and mine\\nare the same; your forms wound me, and I hate funerals. What a fuss!\\nWhy you must die—_everyone_ must die; and all are happier when they do.\\nCome home.”\\n\\n“My father has gone on with the clergyman to the churchyard. I thought\\nyou knew she was to be buried today.”\\n\\n“She? I don’t trouble my head about peasants. I don’t know who she is,”\\nanswered Carmilla, with a flash from her fine eyes.\\n\\n“She is the poor girl who fancied she saw a ghost a fortnight ago, and\\nhas been dying ever since, till yesterday, when she expired.”\\n\\n“Tell me nothing about ghosts. I shan’t sleep tonight if you do.”\\n\\n“I hope there is no plague or fever coming; all this looks very like\\nit,” I continued. “The swineherd’s young wife died only a week ago, and\\nshe thought something seized her by the throat as she lay in her bed,\\nand nearly strangled her. Papa says such horrible fancies do accompany\\nsome forms of fever. She was quite well the day before. She sank\\nafterwards, and died before a week.”\\n\\n“Well, _her_ funeral is over, I hope, and _her_ hymn sung; and our ears\\nshan’t be tortured with that discord and jargon. It has made me\\nnervous. Sit down here, beside me; sit close; hold my hand; press it\\nhard-hard-harder.”\\n\\nWe had moved a little back, and had come to another seat.\\n\\nShe sat down. Her face underwent a change that alarmed and even\\nterrified me for a moment. It darkened, and became horribly livid; her\\nteeth and hands were clenched, and she frowned and compressed her lips,\\nwhile she stared down upon the ground at her feet, and trembled all\\nover with a continued shudder as irrepressible as ague. All her\\nenergies seemed strained to suppress a fit, with which she was then\\nbreathlessly tugging; and at length a low convulsive cry of suffering\\nbroke from her, and gradually the hysteria subsided. “There! That comes\\nof strangling people with hymns!” she said at last. “Hold me, hold me\\nstill. It is passing away.”\\n\\nAnd so gradually it did; and perhaps to dissipate the somber impression\\nwhich the spectacle had left upon me, she became unusually animated and\\nchatty; and so we got home.\\n\\nThis was the first time I had seen her exhibit any definable symptoms\\nof that delicacy of health which her mother had spoken of. It was the\\nfirst time, also, I had seen her exhibit anything like temper.\\n\\nBoth passed away like a summer cloud; and never but once afterwards did\\nI witness on her part a momentary sign of anger. I will tell you how it\\nhappened.\\n\\nShe and I were looking out of one of the long drawing room windows,\\nwhen there entered the courtyard, over the drawbridge, a figure of a\\nwanderer whom I knew very well. He used to visit the schloss generally\\ntwice a year.\\n\\nIt was the figure of a hunchback, with the sharp lean features that\\ngenerally accompany deformity. He wore a pointed black beard, and he\\nwas smiling from ear to ear, showing his white fangs. He was dressed in\\nbuff, black, and scarlet, and crossed with more straps and belts than I\\ncould count, from which hung all manner of things. Behind, he carried a\\nmagic lantern, and two boxes, which I well knew, in one of which was a\\nsalamander, and in the other a mandrake. These monsters used to make my\\nfather laugh. They were compounded of parts of monkeys, parrots,\\nsquirrels, fish, and hedgehogs, dried and stitched together with great\\nneatness and startling effect. He had a fiddle, a box of conjuring\\napparatus, a pair of foils and masks attached to his belt, several\\nother mysterious cases dangling about him, and a black staff with\\ncopper ferrules in his hand. His companion was a rough spare dog, that\\nfollowed at his heels, but stopped short, suspiciously at the\\ndrawbridge, and in a little while began to howl dismally.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the mountebank, standing in the midst of the\\ncourtyard, raised his grotesque hat, and made us a very ceremonious\\nbow, paying his compliments very volubly in execrable French, and\\nGerman not much better.\\n\\nThen, disengaging his fiddle, he began to scrape a lively air to which\\nhe sang with a merry discord, dancing with ludicrous airs and activity,\\nthat made me laugh, in spite of the dog’s howling.\\n\\nThen he advanced to the window with many smiles and salutations, and\\nhis hat in his left hand, his fiddle under his arm, and with a fluency\\nthat never took breath, he gabbled a long advertisement of all his\\naccomplishments, and the resources of the various arts which he placed\\nat our service, and the curiosities and entertainments which it was in\\nhis power, at our bidding, to display.\\n\\n“Will your ladyships be pleased to buy an amulet against the oupire,\\nwhich is going like the wolf, I hear, through these woods,” he said\\ndropping his hat on the pavement. “They are dying of it right and left\\nand here is a charm that never fails; only pinned to the pillow, and\\nyou may laugh in his face.”\\n\\nThese charms consisted of oblong slips of vellum, with cabalistic\\nciphers and diagrams upon them.\\n\\nCarmilla instantly purchased one, and so did I.\\n\\nHe was looking up, and we were smiling down upon him, amused; at least,\\nI can answer for myself. His piercing black eye, as he looked up in our\\nfaces, seemed to detect something that fixed for a moment his\\ncuriosity,\\n\\nIn an instant he unrolled a leather case, full of all manner of odd\\nlittle steel instruments.\\n\\n“See here, my lady,” he said, displaying it, and addressing me, “I\\nprofess, among other things less useful, the art of dentistry. Plague\\ntake the dog!” he interpolated. “Silence, beast! He howls so that your\\nladyships can scarcely hear a word. Your noble friend, the young lady\\nat your right, has the sharpest tooth,—long, thin, pointed, like an\\nawl, like a needle; ha, ha! With my sharp and long sight, as I look up,\\nI have seen it distinctly; now if it happens to hurt the young lady,\\nand I think it must, here am I, here are my file, my punch, my nippers;\\nI will make it round and blunt, if her ladyship pleases; no longer the\\ntooth of a fish, but of a beautiful young lady as she is. Hey? Is the\\nyoung lady displeased? Have I been too bold? Have I offended her?”\\n\\nThe young lady, indeed, looked very angry as she drew back from the\\nwindow.\\n\\n“How dares that mountebank insult us so? Where is your father? I shall\\ndemand redress from him. My father would have had the wretch tied up to\\nthe pump, and flogged with a cart whip, and burnt to the bones with the\\ncattle brand!”\\n\\nShe retired from the window a step or two, and sat down, and had hardly\\nlost sight of the offender, when her wrath subsided as suddenly as it\\nhad risen, and she gradually recovered her usual tone, and seemed to\\nforget the little hunchback and his follies.\\n\\nMy father was out of spirits that evening. On coming in he told us that\\nthere had been another case very similar to the two fatal ones which\\nhad lately occurred. The sister of a young peasant on his estate, only\\na mile away, was very ill, had been, as she described it, attacked very\\nnearly in the same way, and was now slowly but steadily sinking.\\n\\n“All this,” said my father, “is strictly referable to natural causes.\\nThese poor people infect one another with their superstitions, and so\\nrepeat in imagination the images of terror that have infested their\\nneighbors.”\\n\\n“But that very circumstance frightens one horribly,” said Carmilla.\\n\\n“How so?” inquired my father.\\n\\n“I am so afraid of fancying I see such things; I think it would be as\\nbad as reality.”\\n\\n“We are in God’s hands: nothing can happen without his permission, and\\nall will end well for those who love him. He is our faithful creator;\\nHe has made us all, and will take care of us.”\\n\\n“Creator! _Nature!_” said the young lady in answer to my gentle father.\\n“And this disease that invades the country is natural. Nature. All\\nthings proceed from Nature—don’t they? All things in the heaven, in the\\nearth, and under the earth, act and live as Nature ordains? I think\\nso.”\\n\\n“The doctor said he would come here today,” said my father, after a\\nsilence. “I want to know what he thinks about it, and what he thinks we\\nhad better do.”\\n\\n“Doctors never did me any good,” said Carmilla.\\n\\n“Then you have been ill?” I asked.\\n\\n“More ill than ever you were,” she answered.\\n\\n“Long ago?”\\n\\n“Yes, a long time. I suffered from this very illness; but I forget all\\nbut my pain and weakness, and they were not so bad as are suffered in\\nother diseases.”\\n\\n“You were very young then?”\\n\\n“I dare say, let us talk no more of it. You would not wound a friend?”\\n\\nShe looked languidly in my eyes, and passed her arm round my waist\\nlovingly, and led me out of the room. My father was busy over some\\npapers near the window.\\n\\n“Why does your papa like to frighten us?” said the pretty girl with a\\nsigh and a little shudder.\\n\\n“He doesn’t, dear Carmilla, it is the very furthest thing from his\\nmind.”\\n\\n“Are you afraid, dearest?”\\n\\n“I should be very much if I fancied there was any real danger of my\\nbeing attacked as those poor people were.”\\n\\n“You are afraid to die?”\\n\\n“Yes, every one is.”\\n\\n“But to die as lovers may—to die together, so that they may live\\ntogether.\\n\\nGirls are caterpillars while they live in the world, to be finally\\nbutterflies when the summer comes; but in the meantime there are grubs\\nand larvae, don’t you see—each with their peculiar propensities,\\nnecessities and structure. So says Monsieur Buffon, in his big book, in\\nthe next room.”\\n\\nLater in the day the doctor came, and was closeted with papa for some\\ntime.\\n\\nHe was a skilful man, of sixty and upwards, he wore powder, and shaved\\nhis pale face as smooth as a pumpkin. He and papa emerged from the room\\ntogether, and I heard papa laugh, and say as they came out:\\n\\n“Well, I do wonder at a wise man like you. What do you say to\\nhippogriffs and dragons?”\\n\\nThe doctor was smiling, and made answer, shaking his head—\\n\\n“Nevertheless life and death are mysterious states, and we know little\\nof the resources of either.”\\n\\nAnd so they walked on, and I heard no more. I did not then know what\\nthe doctor had been broaching, but I think I guess it now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV.\\nA Wonderful Likeness\\n\\n\\nThis evening there arrived from Gratz the grave, dark-faced son of the\\npicture cleaner, with a horse and cart laden with two large packing\\ncases, having many pictures in each. It was a journey of ten leagues,\\nand whenever a messenger arrived at the schloss from our little capital\\nof Gratz, we used to crowd about him in the hall, to hear the news.\\n\\nThis arrival created in our secluded quarters quite a sensation. The\\ncases remained in the hall, and the messenger was taken charge of by\\nthe servants till he had eaten his supper. Then with assistants, and\\narmed with hammer, ripping chisel, and turnscrew, he met us in the\\nhall, where we had assembled to witness the unpacking of the cases.\\n\\nCarmilla sat looking listlessly on, while one after the other the old\\npictures, nearly all portraits, which had undergone the process of\\nrenovation, were brought to light. My mother was of an old Hungarian\\nfamily, and most of these pictures, which were about to be restored to\\ntheir places, had come to us through her.\\n\\nMy father had a list in his hand, from which he read, as the artist\\nrummaged out the corresponding numbers. I don’t know that the pictures\\nwere very good, but they were, undoubtedly, very old, and some of them\\nvery curious also. They had, for the most part, the merit of being now\\nseen by me, I may say, for the first time; for the smoke and dust of\\ntime had all but obliterated them.\\n\\n“There is a picture that I have not seen yet,” said my father. “In one\\ncorner, at the top of it, is the name, as well as I could read, ‘Marcia\\nKarnstein,’ and the date ‘1698’; and I am curious to see how it has\\nturned out.”\\n\\nI remembered it; it was a small picture, about a foot and a half high,\\nand nearly square, without a frame; but it was so blackened by age that\\nI could not make it out.\\n\\nThe artist now produced it, with evident pride. It was quite beautiful;\\nit was startling; it seemed to live. It was the effigy of Carmilla!\\n\\n“Carmilla, dear, here is an absolute miracle. Here you are, living,\\nsmiling, ready to speak, in this picture. Isn’t it beautiful, Papa? And\\nsee, even the little mole on her throat.”\\n\\nMy father laughed, and said “Certainly it is a wonderful likeness,” but\\nhe looked away, and to my surprise seemed but little struck by it, and\\nwent on talking to the picture cleaner, who was also something of an\\nartist, and discoursed with intelligence about the portraits or other\\nworks, which his art had just brought into light and color, while I was\\nmore and more lost in wonder the more I looked at the picture.\\n\\n“Will you let me hang this picture in my room, papa?” I asked.\\n\\n“Certainly, dear,” said he, smiling, “I’m very glad you think it so\\nlike.\\n\\nIt must be prettier even than I thought it, if it is.”\\n\\nThe young lady did not acknowledge this pretty speech, did not seem to\\nhear it. She was leaning back in her seat, her fine eyes under their\\nlong lashes gazing on me in contemplation, and she smiled in a kind of\\nrapture.\\n\\n“And now you can read quite plainly the name that is written in the\\ncorner.\\n\\nIt is not Marcia; it looks as if it was done in gold. The name is\\nMircalla, Countess Karnstein, and this is a little coronet over and\\nunderneath A.D.\\n\\n1698. I am descended from the Karnsteins; that is, mamma was.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said the lady, languidly, “so am I, I think, a very long descent,\\nvery ancient. Are there any Karnsteins living now?”\\n\\n“None who bear the name, I believe. The family were ruined, I believe,\\nin some civil wars, long ago, but the ruins of the castle are only\\nabout three miles away.”\\n\\n“How interesting!” she said, languidly. “But see what beautiful\\nmoonlight!” She glanced through the hall door, which stood a little\\nopen. “Suppose you take a little ramble round the court, and look down\\nat the road and river.”\\n\\n“It is so like the night you came to us,” I said.\\n\\nShe sighed; smiling.\\n\\nShe rose, and each with her arm about the other’s waist, we walked out\\nupon the pavement.\\n\\nIn silence, slowly we walked down to the drawbridge, where the\\nbeautiful landscape opened before us.\\n\\n“And so you were thinking of the night I came here?” she almost\\nwhispered.\\n\\n“Are you glad I came?”\\n\\n“Delighted, dear Carmilla,” I answered.\\n\\n“And you asked for the picture you think like me, to hang in your\\nroom,” she murmured with a sigh, as she drew her arm closer about my\\nwaist, and let her pretty head sink upon my shoulder. “How romantic you\\nare, Carmilla,” I said. “Whenever you tell me your story, it will be\\nmade up chiefly of some one great romance.”\\n\\nShe kissed me silently.\\n\\n“I am sure, Carmilla, you have been in love; that there is, at this\\nmoment, an affair of the heart going on.”\\n\\n“I have been in love with no one, and never shall,” she whispered,\\n“unless it should be with you.”\\n\\nHow beautiful she looked in the moonlight!\\n\\nShy and strange was the look with which she quickly hid her face in my\\nneck and hair, with tumultuous sighs, that seemed almost to sob, and\\npressed in mine a hand that trembled.\\n\\nHer soft cheek was glowing against mine. “Darling, darling,” she\\nmurmured, “I live in you; and you would die for me, I love you so.”\\n\\nI started from her.\\n\\nShe was gazing on me with eyes from which all fire, all meaning had\\nflown, and a face colorless and apathetic.\\n\\n“Is there a chill in the air, dear?” she said drowsily. “I almost\\nshiver; have I been dreaming? Let us come in. Come; come; come in.”\\n\\n“You look ill, Carmilla; a little faint. You certainly must take some\\nwine,” I said.\\n\\n“Yes. I will. I’m better now. I shall be quite well in a few minutes.\\nYes, do give me a little wine,” answered Carmilla, as we approached the\\ndoor.\\n\\n“Let us look again for a moment; it is the last time, perhaps, I shall\\nsee the moonlight with you.”\\n\\n“How do you feel now, dear Carmilla? Are you really better?” I asked.\\n\\nI was beginning to take alarm, lest she should have been stricken with\\nthe strange epidemic that they said had invaded the country about us.\\n\\n“Papa would be grieved beyond measure,” I added, “if he thought you\\nwere ever so little ill, without immediately letting us know. We have a\\nvery skilful doctor near us, the physician who was with papa today.”\\n\\n“I’m sure he is. I know how kind you all are; but, dear child, I am\\nquite well again. There is nothing ever wrong with me, but a little\\nweakness.\\n\\nPeople say I am languid; I am incapable of exertion; I can scarcely\\nwalk as far as a child of three years old: and every now and then the\\nlittle strength I have falters, and I become as you have just seen me.\\nBut after all I am very easily set up again; in a moment I am perfectly\\nmyself. See how I have recovered.”\\n\\nSo, indeed, she had; and she and I talked a great deal, and very\\nanimated she was; and the remainder of that evening passed without any\\nrecurrence of what I called her infatuations. I mean her crazy talk and\\nlooks, which embarrassed, and even frightened me.\\n\\nBut there occurred that night an event which gave my thoughts quite a\\nnew turn, and seemed to startle even Carmilla’s languid nature into\\nmomentary energy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI.\\nA Very Strange Agony\\n\\n\\nWhen we got into the drawing room, and had sat down to our coffee and\\nchocolate, although Carmilla did not take any, she seemed quite herself\\nagain, and Madame, and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine, joined us, and made\\na little card party, in the course of which papa came in for what he\\ncalled his “dish of tea.”\\n\\nWhen the game was over he sat down beside Carmilla on the sofa, and\\nasked her, a little anxiously, whether she had heard from her mother\\nsince her arrival.\\n\\nShe answered “No.”\\n\\nHe then asked whether she knew where a letter would reach her at\\npresent.\\n\\n“I cannot tell,” she answered ambiguously, “but I have been thinking of\\nleaving you; you have been already too hospitable and too kind to me. I\\nhave given you an infinity of trouble, and I should wish to take a\\ncarriage tomorrow, and post in pursuit of her; I know where I shall\\nultimately find her, although I dare not yet tell you.”\\n\\n“But you must not dream of any such thing,” exclaimed my father, to my\\ngreat relief. “We can’t afford to lose you so, and I won’t consent to\\nyour leaving us, except under the care of your mother, who was so good\\nas to consent to your remaining with us till she should herself return.\\nI should be quite happy if I knew that you heard from her: but this\\nevening the accounts of the progress of the mysterious disease that has\\ninvaded our neighborhood, grow even more alarming; and my beautiful\\nguest, I do feel the responsibility, unaided by advice from your\\nmother, very much. But I shall do my best; and one thing is certain,\\nthat you must not think of leaving us without her distinct direction to\\nthat effect. We should suffer too much in parting from you to consent\\nto it easily.”\\n\\n“Thank you, sir, a thousand times for your hospitality,” she answered,\\nsmiling bashfully. “You have all been too kind to me; I have seldom\\nbeen so happy in all my life before, as in your beautiful chateau,\\nunder your care, and in the society of your dear daughter.”\\n\\nSo he gallantly, in his old-fashioned way, kissed her hand, smiling and\\npleased at her little speech.\\n\\nI accompanied Carmilla as usual to her room, and sat and chatted with\\nher while she was preparing for bed.\\n\\n“Do you think,” I said at length, “that you will ever confide fully in\\nme?”\\n\\nShe turned round smiling, but made no answer, only continued to smile\\non me.\\n\\n“You won’t answer that?” I said. “You can’t answer pleasantly; I ought\\nnot to have asked you.”\\n\\n“You were quite right to ask me that, or anything. You do not know how\\ndear you are to me, or you could not think any confidence too great to\\nlook for.\\n\\nBut I am under vows, no nun half so awfully, and I dare not tell my\\nstory yet, even to you. The time is very near when you shall know\\neverything. You will think me cruel, very selfish, but love is always\\nselfish; the more ardent the more selfish. How jealous I am you cannot\\nknow. You must come with me, loving me, to death; or else hate me and\\nstill come with me. and _hating_ me through death and after. There is\\nno such word as indifference in my apathetic nature.”\\n\\n“Now, Carmilla, you are going to talk your wild nonsense again,” I said\\nhastily.\\n\\n“Not I, silly little fool as I am, and full of whims and fancies; for\\nyour sake I’ll talk like a sage. Were you ever at a ball?”\\n\\n“No; how you do run on. What is it like? How charming it must be.”\\n\\n“I almost forget, it is years ago.”\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n“You are not so old. Your first ball can hardly be forgotten yet.”\\n\\n“I remember everything about it—with an effort. I see it all, as divers\\nsee what is going on above them, through a medium, dense, rippling, but\\ntransparent. There occurred that night what has confused the picture,\\nand made its colours faint. I was all but assassinated in my bed,\\nwounded here,” she touched her breast, “and never was the same since.”\\n\\n“Were you near dying?”\\n\\n“Yes, very—a cruel love—strange love, that would have taken my life.\\nLove will have its sacrifices. No sacrifice without blood. Let us go to\\nsleep now; I feel so lazy. How can I get up just now and lock my door?”\\n\\nShe was lying with her tiny hands buried in her rich wavy hair, under\\nher cheek, her little head upon the pillow, and her glittering eyes\\nfollowed me wherever I moved, with a kind of shy smile that I could not\\ndecipher.\\n\\nI bid her good night, and crept from the room with an uncomfortable\\nsensation.\\n\\nI often wondered whether our pretty guest ever said her prayers. I\\ncertainly had never seen her upon her knees. In the morning she never\\ncame down until long after our family prayers were over, and at night\\nshe never left the drawing room to attend our brief evening prayers in\\nthe hall.\\n\\nIf it had not been that it had casually come out in one of our careless\\ntalks that she had been baptised, I should have doubted her being a\\nChristian. Religion was a subject on which I had never heard her speak\\na word. If I had known the world better, this particular neglect or\\nantipathy would not have so much surprised me.\\n\\nThe precautions of nervous people are infectious, and persons of a like\\ntemperament are pretty sure, after a time, to imitate them. I had\\nadopted Carmilla’s habit of locking her bedroom door, having taken into\\nmy head all her whimsical alarms about midnight invaders and prowling\\nassassins. I had also adopted her precaution of making a brief search\\nthrough her room, to satisfy herself that no lurking assassin or robber\\nwas “ensconced.”\\n\\nThese wise measures taken, I got into my bed and fell asleep. A light\\nwas burning in my room. This was an old habit, of very early date, and\\nwhich nothing could have tempted me to dispense with.\\n\\nThus fortifed I might take my rest in peace. But dreams come through\\nstone walls, light up dark rooms, or darken light ones, and their\\npersons make their exits and their entrances as they please, and laugh\\nat locksmiths.\\n\\nI had a dream that night that was the beginning of a very strange\\nagony.\\n\\nI cannot call it a nightmare, for I was quite conscious of being\\nasleep.\\n\\nBut I was equally conscious of being in my room, and lying in bed,\\nprecisely as I actually was. I saw, or fancied I saw, the room and its\\nfurniture just as I had seen it last, except that it was very dark, and\\nI saw something moving round the foot of the bed, which at first I\\ncould not accurately distinguish. But I soon saw that it was a\\nsooty-black animal that resembled a monstrous cat. It appeared to me\\nabout four or five feet long for it measured fully the length of the\\nhearthrug as it passed over it; and it continued to-ing and fro-ing\\nwith the lithe, sinister restlessness of a beast in a cage. I could not\\ncry out, although as you may suppose, I was terrified. Its pace was\\ngrowing faster, and the room rapidly darker and darker, and at length\\nso dark that I could no longer see anything of it but its eyes. I felt\\nit spring lightly on the bed. The two broad eyes approached my face,\\nand suddenly I felt a stinging pain as if two large needles darted, an\\ninch or two apart, deep into my breast. I waked with a scream. The room\\nwas lighted by the candle that burnt there all through the night, and I\\nsaw a female figure standing at the foot of the bed, a little at the\\nright side. It was in a dark loose dress, and its hair was down and\\ncovered its shoulders. A block of stone could not have been more still.\\nThere was not the slightest stir of respiration. As I stared at it, the\\nfigure appeared to have changed its place, and was now nearer the door;\\nthen, close to it, the door opened, and it passed out.\\n\\nI was now relieved, and able to breathe and move. My first thought was\\nthat Carmilla had been playing me a trick, and that I had forgotten to\\nsecure my door. I hastened to it, and found it locked as usual on the\\ninside. I was afraid to open it—I was horrified. I sprang into my bed\\nand covered my head up in the bedclothes, and lay there more dead than\\nalive till morning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII.\\nDescending\\n\\n\\nIt would be vain my attempting to tell you the horror with which, even\\nnow, I recall the occurrence of that night. It was no such transitory\\nterror as a dream leaves behind it. It seemed to deepen by time, and\\ncommunicated itself to the room and the very furniture that had\\nencompassed the apparition.\\n\\nI could not bear next day to be alone for a moment. I should have told\\npapa, but for two opposite reasons. At one time I thought he would\\nlaugh at my story, and I could not bear its being treated as a jest;\\nand at another I thought he might fancy that I had been attacked by the\\nmysterious complaint which had invaded our neighborhood. I had myself\\nno misgiving of the kind, and as he had been rather an invalid for some\\ntime, I was afraid of alarming him.\\n\\nI was comfortable enough with my good-natured companions, Madame\\nPerrodon, and the vivacious Mademoiselle Lafontaine. They both\\nperceived that I was out of spirits and nervous, and at length I told\\nthem what lay so heavy at my heart.\\n\\nMademoiselle laughed, but I fancied that Madame Perrodon looked\\nanxious.\\n\\n“By-the-by,” said Mademoiselle, laughing, “the long lime tree walk,\\nbehind Carmilla’s bedroom window, is haunted!”\\n\\n“Nonsense!” exclaimed Madame, who probably thought the theme rather\\ninopportune, “and who tells that story, my dear?”\\n\\n“Martin says that he came up twice, when the old yard gate was being\\nrepaired, before sunrise, and twice saw the same female figure walking\\ndown the lime tree avenue.”\\n\\n“So he well might, as long as there are cows to milk in the river\\nfields,” said Madame.\\n\\n“I daresay; but Martin chooses to be frightened, and never did I see\\nfool more frightened.”\\n\\n“You must not say a word about it to Carmilla, because she can see down\\nthat walk from her room window,” I interposed, “and she is, if\\npossible, a greater coward than I.”\\n\\nCarmilla came down rather later than usual that day.\\n\\n“I was so frightened last night,” she said, so soon as were together,\\n“and I am sure I should have seen something dreadful if it had not been\\nfor that charm I bought from the poor little hunchback whom I called\\nsuch hard names. I had a dream of something black coming round my bed,\\nand I awoke in a perfect horror, and I really thought, for some\\nseconds, I saw a dark figure near the chimneypiece, but I felt under my\\npillow for my charm, and the moment my fingers touched it, the figure\\ndisappeared, and I felt quite certain, only that I had it by me, that\\nsomething frightful would have made its appearance, and, perhaps,\\nthrottled me, as it did those poor people we heard of.\\n\\n“Well, listen to me,” I began, and recounted my adventure, at the\\nrecital of which she appeared horrified.\\n\\n“And had you the charm near you?” she asked, earnestly.\\n\\n“No, I had dropped it into a china vase in the drawing room, but I\\nshall certainly take it with me tonight, as you have so much faith in\\nit.”\\n\\nAt this distance of time I cannot tell you, or even understand, how I\\novercame my horror so effectually as to lie alone in my room that\\nnight. I remember distinctly that I pinned the charm to my pillow. I\\nfell asleep almost immediately, and slept even more soundly than usual\\nall night.\\n\\nNext night I passed as well. My sleep was delightfully deep and\\ndreamless.\\n\\nBut I wakened with a sense of lassitude and melancholy, which, however,\\ndid not exceed a degree that was almost luxurious.\\n\\n“Well, I told you so,” said Carmilla, when I described my quiet sleep,\\n“I had such delightful sleep myself last night; I pinned the charm to\\nthe breast of my nightdress. It was too far away the night before. I am\\nquite sure it was all fancy, except the dreams. I used to think that\\nevil spirits made dreams, but our doctor told me it is no such thing.\\nOnly a fever passing by, or some other malady, as they often do, he\\nsaid, knocks at the door, and not being able to get in, passes on, with\\nthat alarm.”\\n\\n“And what do you think the charm is?” said I.\\n\\n“It has been fumigated or immersed in some drug, and is an antidote\\nagainst the malaria,” she answered.\\n\\n“Then it acts only on the body?”\\n\\n“Certainly; you don’t suppose that evil spirits are frightened by bits\\nof ribbon, or the perfumes of a druggist’s shop? No, these complaints,\\nwandering in the air, begin by trying the nerves, and so infect the\\nbrain, but before they can seize upon you, the antidote repels them.\\nThat I am sure is what the charm has done for us. It is nothing\\nmagical, it is simply natural.\\n\\nI should have been happier if I could have quite agreed with Carmilla,\\nbut I did my best, and the impression was a little losing its force.\\n\\nFor some nights I slept profoundly; but still every morning I felt the\\nsame lassitude, and a languor weighed upon me all day. I felt myself a\\nchanged girl. A strange melancholy was stealing over me, a melancholy\\nthat I would not have interrupted. Dim thoughts of death began to open,\\nand an idea that I was slowly sinking took gentle, and, somehow, not\\nunwelcome, possession of me. If it was sad, the tone of mind which this\\ninduced was also sweet.\\n\\nWhatever it might be, my soul acquiesced in it.\\n\\nI would not admit that I was ill, I would not consent to tell my papa,\\nor to have the doctor sent for.\\n\\nCarmilla became more devoted to me than ever, and her strange paroxysms\\nof languid adoration more frequent. She used to gloat on me with\\nincreasing ardor the more my strength and spirits waned. This always\\nshocked me like a momentary glare of insanity.\\n\\nWithout knowing it, I was now in a pretty advanced stage of the\\nstrangest illness under which mortal ever suffered. There was an\\nunaccountable fascination in its earlier symptoms that more than\\nreconciled me to the incapacitating effect of that stage of the malady.\\nThis fascination increased for a time, until it reached a certain\\npoint, when gradually a sense of the horrible mingled itself with it,\\ndeepening, as you shall hear, until it discolored and perverted the\\nwhole state of my life.\\n\\nThe first change I experienced was rather agreeable. It was very near\\nthe turning point from which began the descent of Avernus.\\n\\nCertain vague and strange sensations visited me in my sleep. The\\nprevailing one was of that pleasant, peculiar cold thrill which we feel\\nin bathing, when we move against the current of a river. This was soon\\naccompanied by dreams that seemed interminable, and were so vague that\\nI could never recollect their scenery and persons, or any one connected\\nportion of their action. But they left an awful impression, and a sense\\nof exhaustion, as if I had passed through a long period of great mental\\nexertion and danger.\\n\\nAfter all these dreams there remained on waking a remembrance of having\\nbeen in a place very nearly dark, and of having spoken to people whom I\\ncould not see; and especially of one clear voice, of a female’s, very\\ndeep, that spoke as if at a distance, slowly, and producing always the\\nsame sensation of indescribable solemnity and fear. Sometimes there\\ncame a sensation as if a hand was drawn softly along my cheek and neck.\\nSometimes it was as if warm lips kissed me, and longer and longer and\\nmore lovingly as they reached my throat, but there the caress fixed\\nitself. My heart beat faster, my breathing rose and fell rapidly and\\nfull drawn; a sobbing, that rose into a sense of strangulation,\\nsupervened, and turned into a dreadful convulsion, in which my senses\\nleft me and I became unconscious.\\n\\nIt was now three weeks since the commencement of this unaccountable\\nstate.\\n\\nMy sufferings had, during the last week, told upon my appearance. I had\\ngrown pale, my eyes were dilated and darkened underneath, and the\\nlanguor which I had long felt began to display itself in my\\ncountenance.\\n\\nMy father asked me often whether I was ill; but, with an obstinacy\\nwhich now seems to me unaccountable, I persisted in assuring him that I\\nwas quite well.\\n\\nIn a sense this was true. I had no pain, I could complain of no bodily\\nderangement. My complaint seemed to be one of the imagination, or the\\nnerves, and, horrible as my sufferings were, I kept them, with a morbid\\nreserve, very nearly to myself.\\n\\nIt could not be that terrible complaint which the peasants called the\\noupire, for I had now been suffering for three weeks, and they were\\nseldom ill for much more than three days, when death put an end to\\ntheir miseries.\\n\\nCarmilla complained of dreams and feverish sensations, but by no means\\nof so alarming a kind as mine. I say that mine were extremely alarming.\\nHad I been capable of comprehending my condition, I would have invoked\\naid and advice on my knees. The narcotic of an unsuspected influence\\nwas acting upon me, and my perceptions were benumbed.\\n\\nI am going to tell you now of a dream that led immediately to an odd\\ndiscovery.\\n\\nOne night, instead of the voice I was accustomed to hear in the dark, I\\nheard one, sweet and tender, and at the same time terrible, which said,\\n\\n“Your mother warns you to beware of the assassin.” At the same time a\\nlight unexpectedly sprang up, and I saw Carmilla, standing, near the\\nfoot of my bed, in her white nightdress, bathed, from her chin to her\\nfeet, in one great stain of blood.\\n\\nI wakened with a shriek, possessed with the one idea that Carmilla was\\nbeing murdered. I remember springing from my bed, and my next\\nrecollection is that of standing on the lobby, crying for help.\\n\\nMadame and Mademoiselle came scurrying out of their rooms in alarm; a\\nlamp burned always on the lobby, and seeing me, they soon learned the\\ncause of my terror.\\n\\nI insisted on our knocking at Carmilla’s door. Our knocking was\\nunanswered.\\n\\nIt soon became a pounding and an uproar. We shrieked her name, but all\\nwas vain.\\n\\nWe all grew frightened, for the door was locked. We hurried back, in\\npanic, to my room. There we rang the bell long and furiously. If my\\nfather’s room had been at that side of the house, we would have called\\nhim up at once to our aid. But, alas! he was quite out of hearing, and\\nto reach him involved an excursion for which we none of us had courage.\\n\\nServants, however, soon came running up the stairs; I had got on my\\ndressing gown and slippers meanwhile, and my companions were already\\nsimilarly furnished. Recognizing the voices of the servants on the\\nlobby, we sallied out together; and having renewed, as fruitlessly, our\\nsummons at Carmilla’s door, I ordered the men to force the lock. They\\ndid so, and we stood, holding our lights aloft, in the doorway, and so\\nstared into the room.\\n\\nWe called her by name; but there was still no reply. We looked round\\nthe room. Everything was undisturbed. It was exactly in the state in\\nwhich I had left it on bidding her good night. But Carmilla was gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII.\\nSearch\\n\\n\\nAt sight of the room, perfectly undisturbed except for our violent\\nentrance, we began to cool a little, and soon recovered our senses\\nsufficiently to dismiss the men. It had struck Mademoiselle that\\npossibly Carmilla had been wakened by the uproar at her door, and in\\nher first panic had jumped from her bed, and hid herself in a press, or\\nbehind a curtain, from which she could not, of course, emerge until the\\nmajordomo and his myrmidons had withdrawn. We now recommenced our\\nsearch, and began to call her name again.\\n\\nIt was all to no purpose. Our perplexity and agitation increased. We\\nexamined the windows, but they were secured. I implored of Carmilla, if\\nshe had concealed herself, to play this cruel trick no longer—to come\\nout and to end our anxieties. It was all useless. I was by this time\\nconvinced that she was not in the room, nor in the dressing room, the\\ndoor of which was still locked on this side. She could not have passed\\nit. I was utterly puzzled. Had Carmilla discovered one of those secret\\npassages which the old housekeeper said were known to exist in the\\nschloss, although the tradition of their exact situation had been lost?\\nA little time would, no doubt, explain all—utterly perplexed as, for\\nthe present, we were.\\n\\nIt was past four o’clock, and I preferred passing the remaining hours\\nof darkness in Madame’s room. Daylight brought no solution of the\\ndifficulty.\\n\\nThe whole household, with my father at its head, was in a state of\\nagitation next morning. Every part of the chateau was searched. The\\ngrounds were explored. No trace of the missing lady could be\\ndiscovered. The stream was about to be dragged; my father was in\\ndistraction; what a tale to have to tell the poor girl’s mother on her\\nreturn. I, too, was almost beside myself, though my grief was quite of\\na different kind.\\n\\nThe morning was passed in alarm and excitement. It was now one o’clock,\\nand still no tidings. I ran up to Carmilla’s room, and found her\\nstanding at her dressing table. I was astounded. I could not believe my\\neyes. She beckoned me to her with her pretty finger, in silence. Her\\nface expressed extreme fear.\\n\\nI ran to her in an ecstasy of joy; I kissed and embraced her again and\\nagain. I ran to the bell and rang it vehemently, to bring others to the\\nspot who might at once relieve my father’s anxiety.\\n\\n“Dear Carmilla, what has become of you all this time? We have been in\\nagonies of anxiety about you,” I exclaimed. “Where have you been? How\\ndid you come back?”\\n\\n“Last night has been a night of wonders,” she said.\\n\\n“For mercy’s sake, explain all you can.”\\n\\n“It was past two last night,” she said, “when I went to sleep as usual\\nin my bed, with my doors locked, that of the dressing room, and that\\nopening upon the gallery. My sleep was uninterrupted, and, so far as I\\nknow, dreamless; but I woke just now on the sofa in the dressing room\\nthere, and I found the door between the rooms open, and the other door\\nforced. How could all this have happened without my being wakened? It\\nmust have been accompanied with a great deal of noise, and I am\\nparticularly easily wakened; and how could I have been carried out of\\nmy bed without my sleep having been interrupted, I whom the slightest\\nstir startles?”\\n\\nBy this time, Madame, Mademoiselle, my father, and a number of the\\nservants were in the room. Carmilla was, of course, overwhelmed with\\ninquiries, congratulations, and welcomes. She had but one story to\\ntell, and seemed the least able of all the party to suggest any way of\\naccounting for what had happened.\\n\\nMy father took a turn up and down the room, thinking. I saw Carmilla’s\\neye follow him for a moment with a sly, dark glance.\\n\\nWhen my father had sent the servants away, Mademoiselle having gone in\\nsearch of a little bottle of valerian and salvolatile, and there being\\nno one now in the room with Carmilla, except my father, Madame, and\\nmyself, he came to her thoughtfully, took her hand very kindly, led her\\nto the sofa, and sat down beside her.\\n\\n“Will you forgive me, my dear, if I risk a conjecture, and ask a\\nquestion?”\\n\\n“Who can have a better right?” she said. “Ask what you please, and I\\nwill tell you everything. But my story is simply one of bewilderment\\nand darkness. I know absolutely nothing. Put any question you please,\\nbut you know, of course, the limitations mamma has placed me under.”\\n\\n“Perfectly, my dear child. I need not approach the topics on which she\\ndesires our silence. Now, the marvel of last night consists in your\\nhaving been removed from your bed and your room, without being wakened,\\nand this removal having occurred apparently while the windows were\\nstill secured, and the two doors locked upon the inside. I will tell\\nyou my theory and ask you a question.”\\n\\nCarmilla was leaning on her hand dejectedly; Madame and I were\\nlistening breathlessly.\\n\\n“Now, my question is this. Have you ever been suspected of walking in\\nyour sleep?”\\n\\n“Never, since I was very young indeed.”\\n\\n“But you did walk in your sleep when you were young?”\\n\\n“Yes; I know I did. I have been told so often by my old nurse.”\\n\\nMy father smiled and nodded.\\n\\n“Well, what has happened is this. You got up in your sleep, unlocked\\nthe door, not leaving the key, as usual, in the lock, but taking it out\\nand locking it on the outside; you again took the key out, and carried\\nit away with you to some one of the five-and-twenty rooms on this\\nfloor, or perhaps upstairs or downstairs. There are so many rooms and\\nclosets, so much heavy furniture, and such accumulations of lumber,\\nthat it would require a week to search this old house thoroughly. Do\\nyou see, now, what I mean?”\\n\\n“I do, but not all,” she answered.\\n\\n“And how, papa, do you account for her finding herself on the sofa in\\nthe dressing room, which we had searched so carefully?”\\n\\n“She came there after you had searched it, still in her sleep, and at\\nlast awoke spontaneously, and was as much surprised to find herself\\nwhere she was as any one else. I wish all mysteries were as easily and\\ninnocently explained as yours, Carmilla,” he said, laughing. “And so we\\nmay congratulate ourselves on the certainty that the most natural\\nexplanation of the occurrence is one that involves no drugging, no\\ntampering with locks, no burglars, or poisoners, or witches—nothing\\nthat need alarm Carmilla, or anyone else, for our safety.”\\n\\nCarmilla was looking charmingly. Nothing could be more beautiful than\\nher tints. Her beauty was, I think, enhanced by that graceful languor\\nthat was peculiar to her. I think my father was silently contrasting\\nher looks with mine, for he said:\\n\\n“I wish my poor Laura was looking more like herself”; and he sighed.\\n\\nSo our alarms were happily ended, and Carmilla restored to her friends.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX.\\nThe Doctor\\n\\nAs Carmilla would not hear of an attendant sleeping in her room, my\\nfather arranged that a servant should sleep outside her door, so that\\nshe would not attempt to make another such excursion without being\\narrested at her own door.\\n\\nThat night passed quietly; and next morning early, the doctor, whom my\\nfather had sent for without telling me a word about it, arrived to see\\nme.\\n\\nMadame accompanied me to the library; and there the grave little\\ndoctor, with white hair and spectacles, whom I mentioned before, was\\nwaiting to receive me.\\n\\nI told him my story, and as I proceeded he grew graver and graver.\\n\\nWe were standing, he and I, in the recess of one of the windows, facing\\none another. When my statement was over, he leaned with his shoulders\\nagainst the wall, and with his eyes fixed on me earnestly, with an\\ninterest in which was a dash of horror.\\n\\nAfter a minute’s reflection, he asked Madame if he could see my father.\\n\\nHe was sent for accordingly, and as he entered, smiling, he said:\\n\\n“I dare say, doctor, you are going to tell me that I am an old fool for\\nhaving brought you here; I hope I am.”\\n\\nBut his smile faded into shadow as the doctor, with a very grave face,\\nbeckoned him to him.\\n\\nHe and the doctor talked for some time in the same recess where I had\\njust conferred with the physician. It seemed an earnest and\\nargumentative conversation. The room is very large, and I and Madame\\nstood together, burning with curiosity, at the farther end. Not a word\\ncould we hear, however, for they spoke in a very low tone, and the deep\\nrecess of the window quite concealed the doctor from view, and very\\nnearly my father, whose foot, arm, and shoulder only could we see; and\\nthe voices were, I suppose, all the less audible for the sort of closet\\nwhich the thick wall and window formed.\\n\\nAfter a time my father’s face looked into the room; it was pale,\\nthoughtful, and, I fancied, agitated.\\n\\n“Laura, dear, come here for a moment. Madame, we shan’t trouble you,\\nthe doctor says, at present.”\\n\\nAccordingly I approached, for the first time a little alarmed; for,\\nalthough I felt very weak, I did not feel ill; and strength, one always\\nfancies, is a thing that may be picked up when we please.\\n\\nMy father held out his hand to me, as I drew near, but he was looking\\nat the doctor, and he said:\\n\\n“It certainly is very odd; I don’t understand it quite. Laura, come\\nhere, dear; now attend to Doctor Spielsberg, and recollect yourself.”\\n\\n“You mentioned a sensation like that of two needles piercing the skin,\\nsomewhere about your neck, on the night when you experienced your first\\nhorrible dream. Is there still any soreness?”\\n\\n“None at all,” I answered.\\n\\n“Can you indicate with your finger about the point at which you think\\nthis occurred?”\\n\\n“Very little below my throat—here,” I answered.\\n\\nI wore a morning dress, which covered the place I pointed to.\\n\\n“Now you can satisfy yourself,” said the doctor. “You won’t mind your\\npapa’s lowering your dress a very little. It is necessary, to detect a\\nsymptom of the complaint under which you have been suffering.”\\n\\nI acquiesced. It was only an inch or two below the edge of my collar.\\n\\n“God bless me!—so it is,” exclaimed my father, growing pale.\\n\\n“You see it now with your own eyes,” said the doctor, with a gloomy\\ntriumph.\\n\\n“What is it?” I exclaimed, beginning to be frightened.\\n\\n“Nothing, my dear young lady, but a small blue spot, about the size of\\nthe tip of your little finger; and now,” he continued, turning to papa,\\n“the question is what is best to be done?”\\n\\nIs there any danger?”I urged, in great trepidation.\\n\\n“I trust not, my dear,” answered the doctor. “I don’t see why you\\nshould not recover. I don’t see why you should not begin immediately to\\nget better. That is the point at which the sense of strangulation\\nbegins?”\\n\\n“Yes,” I answered.\\n\\n“And—recollect as well as you can—the same point was a kind of center\\nof that thrill which you described just now, like the current of a cold\\nstream running against you?”\\n\\n“It may have been; I think it was.”\\n\\n“Ay, you see?” he added, turning to my father. “Shall I say a word to\\nMadame?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” said my father.\\n\\nHe called Madame to him, and said:\\n\\n“I find my young friend here far from well. It won’t be of any great\\nconsequence, I hope; but it will be necessary that some steps be taken,\\nwhich I will explain by-and-by; but in the meantime, Madame, you will\\nbe so good as not to let Miss Laura be alone for one moment. That is\\nthe only direction I need give for the present. It is indispensable.”\\n\\n“We may rely upon your kindness, Madame, I know,” added my father.\\n\\nMadame satisfied him eagerly.\\n\\n“And you, dear Laura, I know you will observe the doctor’s direction.”\\n\\n“I shall have to ask your opinion upon another patient, whose symptoms\\nslightly resemble those of my daughter, that have just been detailed to\\nyou—very much milder in degree, but I believe quite of the same sort.\\nShe is a young lady—our guest; but as you say you will be passing this\\nway again this evening, you can’t do better than take your supper here,\\nand you can then see her. She does not come down till the afternoon.”\\n\\n“I thank you,” said the doctor. “I shall be with you, then, at about\\nseven this evening.”\\n\\nAnd then they repeated their directions to me and to Madame, and with\\nthis parting charge my father left us, and walked out with the doctor;\\nand I saw them pacing together up and down between the road and the\\nmoat, on the grassy platform in front of the castle, evidently absorbed\\nin earnest conversation.\\n\\nThe doctor did not return. I saw him mount his horse there, take his\\nleave, and ride away eastward through the forest.\\n\\nNearly at the same time I saw the man arrive from Dranfield with the\\nletters, and dismount and hand the bag to my father.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Madame and I were both busy, lost in conjecture as to\\nthe reasons of the singular and earnest direction which the doctor and\\nmy father had concurred in imposing. Madame, as she afterwards told me,\\nwas afraid the doctor apprehended a sudden seizure, and that, without\\nprompt assistance, I might either lose my life in a fit, or at least be\\nseriously hurt.\\n\\nThe interpretation did not strike me; and I fancied, perhaps luckily\\nfor my nerves, that the arrangement was prescribed simply to secure a\\ncompanion, who would prevent my taking too much exercise, or eating\\nunripe fruit, or doing any of the fifty foolish things to which young\\npeople are supposed to be prone.\\n\\nAbout half an hour after my father came in—he had a letter in his\\nhand—and said:\\n\\n“This letter had been delayed; it is from General Spielsdorf. He might\\nhave been here yesterday, he may not come till tomorrow or he may be\\nhere today.”\\n\\nHe put the open letter into my hand; but he did not look pleased, as he\\nused when a guest, especially one so much loved as the General, was\\ncoming.\\n\\nOn the contrary, he looked as if he wished him at the bottom of the Red\\nSea. There was plainly something on his mind which he did not choose to\\ndivulge.\\n\\n“Papa, darling, will you tell me this?” said I, suddenly laying my hand\\non his arm, and looking, I am sure, imploringly in his face.\\n\\n“Perhaps,” he answered, smoothing my hair caressingly over my eyes.\\n\\n“Does the doctor think me very ill?”\\n\\n“No, dear; he thinks, if right steps are taken, you will be quite well\\nagain, at least, on the high road to a complete recovery, in a day or\\ntwo,” he answered, a little dryly. “I wish our good friend, the\\nGeneral, had chosen any other time; that is, I wish you had been\\nperfectly well to receive him.”\\n\\n“But do tell me, papa,” I insisted, “what does he think is the matter\\nwith me?”\\n\\n“Nothing; you must not plague me with questions,” he answered, with\\nmore irritation than I ever remember him to have displayed before; and\\nseeing that I looked wounded, I suppose, he kissed me, and added, “You\\nshall know all about it in a day or two; that is, all that I know. In\\nthe meantime you are not to trouble your head about it.”\\n\\nHe turned and left the room, but came back before I had done wondering\\nand puzzling over the oddity of all this; it was merely to say that he\\nwas going to Karnstein, and had ordered the carriage to be ready at\\ntwelve, and that I and Madame should accompany him; he was going to see\\nthe priest who lived near those picturesque grounds, upon business, and\\nas Carmilla had never seen them, she could follow, when she came down,\\nwith Mademoiselle, who would bring materials for what you call a\\npicnic, which might be laid for us in the ruined castle.\\n\\nAt twelve o’clock, accordingly, I was ready, and not long after, my\\nfather, Madame and I set out upon our projected drive.\\n\\nPassing the drawbridge we turn to the right, and follow the road over\\nthe steep Gothic bridge, westward, to reach the deserted village and\\nruined castle of Karnstein.\\n\\nNo sylvan drive can be fancied prettier. The ground breaks into gentle\\nhills and hollows, all clothed with beautiful wood, totally destitute\\nof the comparative formality which artificial planting and early\\nculture and pruning impart.\\n\\nThe irregularities of the ground often lead the road out of its course,\\nand cause it to wind beautifully round the sides of broken hollows and\\nthe steeper sides of the hills, among varieties of ground almost\\ninexhaustible.\\n\\nTurning one of these points, we suddenly encountered our old friend,\\nthe General, riding towards us, attended by a mounted servant. His\\nportmanteaus were following in a hired wagon, such as we term a cart.\\n\\nThe General dismounted as we pulled up, and, after the usual greetings,\\nwas easily persuaded to accept the vacant seat in the carriage and send\\nhis horse on with his servant to the schloss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX.\\nBereaved\\n\\n\\nIt was about ten months since we had last seen him: but that time had\\nsufficed to make an alteration of years in his appearance. He had grown\\nthinner; something of gloom and anxiety had taken the place of that\\ncordial serenity which used to characterize his features. His dark blue\\neyes, always penetrating, now gleamed with a sterner light from under\\nhis shaggy grey eyebrows. It was not such a change as grief alone\\nusually induces, and angrier passions seemed to have had their share in\\nbringing it about.\\n\\nWe had not long resumed our drive, when the General began to talk, with\\nhis usual soldierly directness, of the bereavement, as he termed it,\\nwhich he had sustained in the death of his beloved niece and ward; and\\nhe then broke out in a tone of intense bitterness and fury, inveighing\\nagainst the “hellish arts” to which she had fallen a victim, and\\nexpressing, with more exasperation than piety, his wonder that Heaven\\nshould tolerate so monstrous an indulgence of the lusts and malignity\\nof hell.\\n\\nMy father, who saw at once that something very extraordinary had\\nbefallen, asked him, if not too painful to him, to detail the\\ncircumstances which he thought justified the strong terms in which he\\nexpressed himself.\\n\\n“I should tell you all with pleasure,” said the General, “but you would\\nnot believe me.”\\n\\n“Why should I not?” he asked.\\n\\n“Because,” he answered testily, “you believe in nothing but what\\nconsists with your own prejudices and illusions. I remember when I was\\nlike you, but I have learned better.”\\n\\n“Try me,” said my father; “I am not such a dogmatist as you suppose.\\n\\nBesides which, I very well know that you generally require proof for\\nwhat you believe, and am, therefore, very strongly predisposed to\\nrespect your conclusions.”\\n\\n“You are right in supposing that I have not been led lightly into a\\nbelief in the marvelous—for what I have experienced is marvelous—and I\\nhave been forced by extraordinary evidence to credit that which ran\\ncounter, diametrically, to all my theories. I have been made the dupe\\nof a preternatural conspiracy.”\\n\\nNotwithstanding his professions of confidence in the General’s\\npenetration, I saw my father, at this point, glance at the General,\\nwith, as I thought, a marked suspicion of his sanity.\\n\\nThe General did not see it, luckily. He was looking gloomily and\\ncuriously into the glades and vistas of the woods that were opening\\nbefore us.\\n\\n“You are going to the Ruins of Karnstein?” he said. “Yes, it is a lucky\\ncoincidence; do you know I was going to ask you to bring me there to\\ninspect them. I have a special object in exploring. There is a ruined\\nchapel, ain’t there, with a great many tombs of that extinct family?”\\n\\n“So there are—highly interesting,” said my father. “I hope you are\\nthinking of claiming the title and estates?”\\n\\nMy father said this gaily, but the General did not recollect the laugh,\\nor even the smile, which courtesy exacts for a friend’s joke; on the\\ncontrary, he looked grave and even fierce, ruminating on a matter that\\nstirred his anger and horror.\\n\\n“Something very different,” he said, gruffly. “I mean to unearth some\\nof those fine people. I hope, by God’s blessing, to accomplish a pious\\nsacrilege here, which will relieve our earth of certain monsters, and\\nenable honest people to sleep in their beds without being assailed by\\nmurderers. I have strange things to tell you, my dear friend, such as I\\nmyself would have scouted as incredible a few months since.”\\n\\nMy father looked at him again, but this time not with a glance of\\nsuspicion—with an eye, rather, of keen intelligence and alarm.\\n\\n“The house of Karnstein,” he said, “has been long extinct: a hundred\\nyears at least. My dear wife was maternally descended from the\\nKarnsteins. But the name and title have long ceased to exist. The\\ncastle is a ruin; the very village is deserted; it is fifty years since\\nthe smoke of a chimney was seen there; not a roof left.”\\n\\n“Quite true. I have heard a great deal about that since I last saw you;\\na great deal that will astonish you. But I had better relate everything\\nin the order in which it occurred,” said the General. “You saw my dear\\nward—my child, I may call her. No creature could have been more\\nbeautiful, and only three months ago none more blooming.”\\n\\n“Yes, poor thing! when I saw her last she certainly was quite lovely,”\\nsaid my father. “I was grieved and shocked more than I can tell you, my\\ndear friend; I knew what a blow it was to you.”\\n\\nHe took the General’s hand, and they exchanged a kind pressure. Tears\\ngathered in the old soldier’s eyes. He did not seek to conceal them. He\\nsaid:\\n\\n“We have been very old friends; I knew you would feel for me, childless\\nas I am. She had become an object of very near interest to me, and\\nrepaid my care by an affection that cheered my home and made my life\\nhappy. That is all gone. The years that remain to me on earth may not\\nbe very long; but by God’s mercy I hope to accomplish a service to\\nmankind before I die, and to subserve the vengeance of Heaven upon the\\nfiends who have murdered my poor child in the spring of her hopes and\\nbeauty!”\\n\\n“You said, just now, that you intended relating everything as it\\noccurred,” said my father. “Pray do; I assure you that it is not mere\\ncuriosity that prompts me.”\\n\\nBy this time we had reached the point at which the Drunstall road, by\\nwhich the General had come, diverges from the road which we were\\ntraveling to Karnstein.\\n\\n“How far is it to the ruins?” inquired the General, looking anxiously\\nforward.\\n\\n“About half a league,” answered my father. “Pray let us hear the story\\nyou were so good as to promise.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI.\\nThe Story\\n\\n\\nWith all my heart,” said the General, with an effort; and after a short\\npause in which to arrange his subject, he commenced one of the\\nstrangest narratives I ever heard.\\n\\n“My dear child was looking forward with great pleasure to the visit you\\nhad been so good as to arrange for her to your charming daughter.” Here\\nhe made me a gallant but melancholy bow. “In the meantime we had an\\ninvitation to my old friend the Count Carlsfeld, whose schloss is about\\nsix leagues to the other side of Karnstein. It was to attend the series\\nof fetes which, you remember, were given by him in honor of his\\nillustrious visitor, the Grand Duke Charles.”\\n\\n“Yes; and very splendid, I believe, they were,” said my father.\\n\\n“Princely! But then his hospitalities are quite regal. He has Aladdin’s\\nlamp. The night from which my sorrow dates was devoted to a magnificent\\nmasquerade. The grounds were thrown open, the trees hung with colored\\nlamps. There was such a display of fireworks as Paris itself had never\\nwitnessed. And such music—music, you know, is my weakness—such\\nravishing music! The finest instrumental band, perhaps, in the world,\\nand the finest singers who could be collected from all the great operas\\nin Europe. As you wandered through these fantastically illuminated\\ngrounds, the moon-lighted chateau throwing a rosy light from its long\\nrows of windows, you would suddenly hear these ravishing voices\\nstealing from the silence of some grove, or rising from boats upon the\\nlake. I felt myself, as I looked and listened, carried back into the\\nromance and poetry of my early youth.\\n\\n“When the fireworks were ended, and the ball beginning, we returned to\\nthe noble suite of rooms that were thrown open to the dancers. A masked\\nball, you know, is a beautiful sight; but so brilliant a spectacle of\\nthe kind I never saw before.\\n\\n“It was a very aristocratic assembly. I was myself almost the only\\n‘nobody’ present.\\n\\n“My dear child was looking quite beautiful. She wore no mask. Her\\nexcitement and delight added an unspeakable charm to her features,\\nalways lovely. I remarked a young lady, dressed magnificently, but\\nwearing a mask, who appeared to me to be observing my ward with\\nextraordinary interest. I had seen her, earlier in the evening, in the\\ngreat hall, and again, for a few minutes, walking near us, on the\\nterrace under the castle windows, similarly employed. A lady, also\\nmasked, richly and gravely dressed, and with a stately air, like a\\nperson of rank, accompanied her as a chaperon.\\n\\nHad the young lady not worn a mask, I could, of course, have been much\\nmore certain upon the question whether she was really watching my poor\\ndarling.\\n\\nI am now well assured that she was.\\n\\n“We were now in one of the salons. My poor dear child had been dancing,\\nand was resting a little in one of the chairs near the door; I was\\nstanding near. The two ladies I have mentioned had approached and the\\nyounger took the chair next my ward; while her companion stood beside\\nme, and for a little time addressed herself, in a low tone, to her\\ncharge.\\n\\n“Availing herself of the privilege of her mask, she turned to me, and\\nin the tone of an old friend, and calling me by my name, opened a\\nconversation with me, which piqued my curiosity a good deal. She\\nreferred to many scenes where she had met me—at Court, and at\\ndistinguished houses. She alluded to little incidents which I had long\\nceased to think of, but which, I found, had only lain in abeyance in my\\nmemory, for they instantly started into life at her touch.\\n\\n“I became more and more curious to ascertain who she was, every moment.\\nShe parried my attempts to discover very adroitly and pleasantly. The\\nknowledge she showed of many passages in my life seemed to me all but\\nunaccountable; and she appeared to take a not unnatural pleasure in\\nfoiling my curiosity, and in seeing me flounder in my eager perplexity,\\nfrom one conjecture to another.\\n\\n“In the meantime the young lady, whom her mother called by the odd name\\nof Millarca, when she once or twice addressed her, had, with the same\\nease and grace, got into conversation with my ward.\\n\\n“She introduced herself by saying that her mother was a very old\\nacquaintance of mine. She spoke of the agreeable audacity which a mask\\nrendered practicable; she talked like a friend; she admired her dress,\\nand insinuated very prettily her admiration of her beauty. She amused\\nher with laughing criticisms upon the people who crowded the ballroom,\\nand laughed at my poor child’s fun. She was very witty and lively when\\nshe pleased, and after a time they had grown very good friends, and the\\nyoung stranger lowered her mask, displaying a remarkably beautiful\\nface. I had never seen it before, neither had my dear child. But though\\nit was new to us, the features were so engaging, as well as lovely,\\nthat it was impossible not to feel the attraction powerfully. My poor\\ngirl did so. I never saw anyone more taken with another at first sight,\\nunless, indeed, it was the stranger herself, who seemed quite to have\\nlost her heart to her.\\n\\n“In the meantime, availing myself of the license of a masquerade, I put\\nnot a few questions to the elder lady.\\n\\n“‘You have puzzled me utterly,’ I said, laughing. ‘Is that not enough?\\n\\nWon’t you, now, consent to stand on equal terms, and do me the kindness\\nto remove your mask?’\\n\\n“‘Can any request be more unreasonable?’ she replied. ‘Ask a lady to\\nyield an advantage! Beside, how do you know you should recognize me?\\nYears make changes.’\\n\\n“‘As you see,’ I said, with a bow, and, I suppose, a rather melancholy\\nlittle laugh.\\n\\n“‘As philosophers tell us,’ she said; ‘and how do you know that a sight\\nof my face would help you?’\\n\\n“‘I should take chance for that,’ I answered. ‘It is vain trying to\\nmake yourself out an old woman; your figure betrays you.’\\n\\n“‘Years, nevertheless, have passed since I saw you, rather since you\\nsaw me, for that is what I am considering. Millarca, there, is my\\ndaughter; I cannot then be young, even in the opinion of people whom\\ntime has taught to be indulgent, and I may not like to be compared with\\nwhat you remember me.\\n\\nYou have no mask to remove. You can offer me nothing in exchange.’\\n\\n“‘My petition is to your pity, to remove it.’\\n\\n“‘And mine to yours, to let it stay where it is,’ she replied.\\n\\n“‘Well, then, at least you will tell me whether you are French or\\nGerman; you speak both languages so perfectly.’\\n\\n“‘I don’t think I shall tell you that, General; you intend a surprise,\\nand are meditating the particular point of attack.’\\n\\n“‘At all events, you won’t deny this,’ I said, ‘that being honored by\\nyour permission to converse, I ought to know how to address you. Shall\\nI say Madame la Comtesse?’\\n\\n“She laughed, and she would, no doubt, have met me with another\\nevasion—if, indeed, I can treat any occurrence in an interview every\\ncircumstance of which was prearranged, as I now believe, with the\\nprofoundest cunning, as liable to be modified by accident.\\n\\n“‘As to that,’ she began; but she was interrupted, almost as she opened\\nher lips, by a gentleman, dressed in black, who looked particularly\\nelegant and distinguished, with this drawback, that his face was the\\nmost deadly pale I ever saw, except in death. He was in no\\nmasquerade—in the plain evening dress of a gentleman; and he said,\\nwithout a smile, but with a courtly and unusually low bow:—\\n\\n“‘Will Madame la Comtesse permit me to say a very few words which may\\ninterest her?’\\n\\n“The lady turned quickly to him, and touched her lip in token of\\nsilence; she then said to me, ‘Keep my place for me, General; I shall\\nreturn when I have said a few words.’\\n\\n“And with this injunction, playfully given, she walked a little aside\\nwith the gentleman in black, and talked for some minutes, apparently\\nvery earnestly. They then walked away slowly together in the crowd, and\\nI lost them for some minutes.\\n\\n“I spent the interval in cudgeling my brains for a conjecture as to the\\nidentity of the lady who seemed to remember me so kindly, and I was\\nthinking of turning about and joining in the conversation between my\\npretty ward and the Countess’s daughter, and trying whether, by the\\ntime she returned, I might not have a surprise in store for her, by\\nhaving her name, title, chateau, and estates at my fingers’ ends. But\\nat this moment she returned, accompanied by the pale man in black, who\\nsaid:\\n\\n“‘I shall return and inform Madame la Comtesse when her carriage is at\\nthe door.’\\n\\n“He withdrew with a bow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII.\\nA Petition\\n\\n\\n“‘Then we are to lose Madame la Comtesse, but I hope only for a few\\nhours,’ I said, with a low bow.\\n\\n“‘It may be that only, or it may be a few weeks. It was very unlucky\\nhis speaking to me just now as he did. Do you now know me?’\\n\\n“I assured her I did not.\\n\\n“‘You shall know me,’ she said, ‘but not at present. We are older and\\nbetter friends than, perhaps, you suspect. I cannot yet declare myself.\\nI shall in three weeks pass your beautiful schloss, about which I have\\nbeen making enquiries. I shall then look in upon you for an hour or\\ntwo, and renew a friendship which I never think of without a thousand\\npleasant recollections. This moment a piece of news has reached me like\\na thunderbolt. I must set out now, and travel by a devious route,\\nnearly a hundred miles, with all the dispatch I can possibly make. My\\nperplexities multiply. I am only deterred by the compulsory reserve I\\npractice as to my name from making a very singular request of you. My\\npoor child has not quite recovered her strength. Her horse fell with\\nher, at a hunt which she had ridden out to witness, her nerves have not\\nyet recovered the shock, and our physician says that she must on no\\naccount exert herself for some time to come. We came here, in\\nconsequence, by very easy stages—hardly six leagues a day. I must now\\ntravel day and night, on a mission of life and death—a mission the\\ncritical and momentous nature of which I shall be able to explain to\\nyou when we meet, as I hope we shall, in a few weeks, without the\\nnecessity of any concealment.’\\n\\n“She went on to make her petition, and it was in the tone of a person\\nfrom whom such a request amounted to conferring, rather than seeking a\\nfavor.\\n\\nThis was only in manner, and, as it seemed, quite unconsciously. Than\\nthe terms in which it was expressed, nothing could be more deprecatory.\\nIt was simply that I would consent to take charge of her daughter\\nduring her absence.\\n\\n“This was, all things considered, a strange, not to say, an audacious\\nrequest. She in some sort disarmed me, by stating and admitting\\neverything that could be urged against it, and throwing herself\\nentirely upon my chivalry. At the same moment, by a fatality that seems\\nto have predetermined all that happened, my poor child came to my side,\\nand, in an undertone, besought me to invite her new friend, Millarca,\\nto pay us a visit. She had just been sounding her, and thought, if her\\nmamma would allow her, she would like it extremely.\\n\\n“At another time I should have told her to wait a little, until, at\\nleast, we knew who they were. But I had not a moment to think in. The\\ntwo ladies assailed me together, and I must confess the refined and\\nbeautiful face of the young lady, about which there was something\\nextremely engaging, as well as the elegance and fire of high birth,\\ndetermined me; and, quite overpowered, I submitted, and undertook, too\\neasily, the care of the young lady, whom her mother called Millarca.\\n\\n“The Countess beckoned to her daughter, who listened with grave\\nattention while she told her, in general terms, how suddenly and\\nperemptorily she had been summoned, and also of the arrangement she had\\nmade for her under my care, adding that I was one of her earliest and\\nmost valued friends.\\n\\n“I made, of course, such speeches as the case seemed to call for, and\\nfound myself, on reflection, in a position which I did not half like.\\n\\n“The gentleman in black returned, and very ceremoniously conducted the\\nlady from the room.\\n\\n“The demeanor of this gentleman was such as to impress me with the\\nconviction that the Countess was a lady of very much more importance\\nthan her modest title alone might have led me to assume.\\n\\n“Her last charge to me was that no attempt was to be made to learn more\\nabout her than I might have already guessed, until her return. Our\\ndistinguished host, whose guest she was, knew her reasons.\\n\\n“‘But here,’ she said, ‘neither I nor my daughter could safely remain\\nfor more than a day. I removed my mask imprudently for a moment, about\\nan hour ago, and, too late, I fancied you saw me. So I resolved to seek\\nan opportunity of talking a little to you. Had I found that you had\\nseen me, I would have thrown myself on your high sense of honor to keep\\nmy secret some weeks. As it is, I am satisfied that you did not see me;\\nbut if you now suspect, or, on reflection, should suspect, who I am, I\\ncommit myself, in like manner, entirely to your honor. My daughter will\\nobserve the same secrecy, and I well know that you will, from time to\\ntime, remind her, lest she should thoughtlessly disclose it.’\\n\\n“She whispered a few words to her daughter, kissed her hurriedly twice,\\nand went away, accompanied by the pale gentleman in black, and\\ndisappeared in the crowd.\\n\\n“‘In the next room,’ said Millarca, ‘there is a window that looks upon\\nthe hall door. I should like to see the last of mamma, and to kiss my\\nhand to her.’\\n\\n“We assented, of course, and accompanied her to the window. We looked\\nout, and saw a handsome old-fashioned carriage, with a troop of\\ncouriers and footmen. We saw the slim figure of the pale gentleman in\\nblack, as he held a thick velvet cloak, and placed it about her\\nshoulders and threw the hood over her head. She nodded to him, and just\\ntouched his hand with hers. He bowed low repeatedly as the door closed,\\nand the carriage began to move.\\n\\n“‘She is gone,’ said Millarca, with a sigh.\\n\\n“‘She is gone,’ I repeated to myself, for the first time—in the hurried\\nmoments that had elapsed since my consent—reflecting upon the folly of\\nmy act.\\n\\n“‘She did not look up,’ said the young lady, plaintively.\\n\\n“‘The Countess had taken off her mask, perhaps, and did not care to\\nshow her face,’ I said; ‘and she could not know that you were in the\\nwindow.’\\n\\n“She sighed, and looked in my face. She was so beautiful that I\\nrelented. I was sorry I had for a moment repented of my hospitality,\\nand I determined to make her amends for the unavowed churlishness of my\\nreception.\\n\\n“The young lady, replacing her mask, joined my ward in persuading me to\\nreturn to the grounds, where the concert was soon to be renewed. We did\\nso, and walked up and down the terrace that lies under the castle\\nwindows.\\n\\nMillarca became very intimate with us, and amused us with lively\\ndescriptions and stories of most of the great people whom we saw upon\\nthe terrace. I liked her more and more every minute. Her gossip without\\nbeing ill-natured, was extremely diverting to me, who had been so long\\nout of the great world. I thought what life she would give to our\\nsometimes lonely evenings at home.\\n\\n“This ball was not over until the morning sun had almost reached the\\nhorizon. It pleased the Grand Duke to dance till then, so loyal people\\ncould not go away, or think of bed.\\n\\n“We had just got through a crowded saloon, when my ward asked me what\\nhad become of Millarca. I thought she had been by her side, and she\\nfancied she was by mine. The fact was, we had lost her.\\n\\n“All my efforts to find her were vain. I feared that she had mistaken,\\nin the confusion of a momentary separation from us, other people for\\nher new friends, and had, possibly, pursued and lost them in the\\nextensive grounds which were thrown open to us.\\n\\n“Now, in its full force, I recognized a new folly in my having\\nundertaken the charge of a young lady without so much as knowing her\\nname; and fettered as I was by promises, of the reasons for imposing\\nwhich I knew nothing, I could not even point my inquiries by saying\\nthat the missing young lady was the daughter of the Countess who had\\ntaken her departure a few hours before.\\n\\n“Morning broke. It was clear daylight before I gave up my search. It\\nwas not till near two o’clock next day that we heard anything of my\\nmissing charge.\\n\\n“At about that time a servant knocked at my niece’s door, to say that\\nhe had been earnestly requested by a young lady, who appeared to be in\\ngreat distress, to make out where she could find the General Baron\\nSpielsdorf and the young lady his daughter, in whose charge she had\\nbeen left by her mother.\\n\\n“There could be no doubt, notwithstanding the slight inaccuracy, that\\nour young friend had turned up; and so she had. Would to heaven we had\\nlost her!\\n\\n“She told my poor child a story to account for her having failed to\\nrecover us for so long. Very late, she said, she had got to the\\nhousekeeper’s bedroom in despair of finding us, and had then fallen\\ninto a deep sleep which, long as it was, had hardly sufficed to recruit\\nher strength after the fatigues of the ball.\\n\\n“That day Millarca came home with us. I was only too happy, after all,\\nto have secured so charming a companion for my dear girl.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII.\\nThe Woodman\\n\\n\\n“There soon, however, appeared some drawbacks. In the first place,\\nMillarca complained of extreme languor—the weakness that remained after\\nher late illness—and she never emerged from her room till the afternoon\\nwas pretty far advanced. In the next place, it was accidentally\\ndiscovered, although she always locked her door on the inside, and\\nnever disturbed the key from its place till she admitted the maid to\\nassist at her toilet, that she was undoubtedly sometimes absent from\\nher room in the very early morning, and at various times later in the\\nday, before she wished it to be understood that she was stirring. She\\nwas repeatedly seen from the windows of the schloss, in the first faint\\ngrey of the morning, walking through the trees, in an easterly\\ndirection, and looking like a person in a trance. This convinced me\\nthat she walked in her sleep. But this hypothesis did not solve the\\npuzzle. How did she pass out from her room, leaving the door locked on\\nthe inside? How did she escape from the house without unbarring door or\\nwindow?\\n\\n“In the midst of my perplexities, an anxiety of a far more urgent kind\\npresented itself.\\n\\n“My dear child began to lose her looks and health, and that in a manner\\nso mysterious, and even horrible, that I became thoroughly frightened.\\n\\n“She was at first visited by appalling dreams; then, as she fancied, by\\na specter, sometimes resembling Millarca, sometimes in the shape of a\\nbeast, indistinctly seen, walking round the foot of her bed, from side\\nto side.\\n\\nLastly came sensations. One, not unpleasant, but very peculiar, she\\nsaid, resembled the flow of an icy stream against her breast. At a\\nlater time, she felt something like a pair of large needles pierce her,\\na little below the throat, with a very sharp pain. A few nights after,\\nfollowed a gradual and convulsive sense of strangulation; then came\\nunconsciousness.”\\n\\nI could hear distinctly every word the kind old General was saying,\\nbecause by this time we were driving upon the short grass that spreads\\non either side of the road as you approach the roofless village which\\nhad not shown the smoke of a chimney for more than half a century.\\n\\nYou may guess how strangely I felt as I heard my own symptoms so\\nexactly described in those which had been experienced by the poor girl\\nwho, but for the catastrophe which followed, would have been at that\\nmoment a visitor at my father’s chateau. You may suppose, also, how I\\nfelt as I heard him detail habits and mysterious peculiarities which\\nwere, in fact, those of our beautiful guest, Carmilla!\\n\\nA vista opened in the forest; we were on a sudden under the chimneys\\nand gables of the ruined village, and the towers and battlements of the\\ndismantled castle, round which gigantic trees are grouped, overhung us\\nfrom a slight eminence.\\n\\nIn a frightened dream I got down from the carriage, and in silence, for\\nwe had each abundant matter for thinking; we soon mounted the ascent,\\nand were among the spacious chambers, winding stairs, and dark\\ncorridors of the castle.\\n\\n“And this was once the palatial residence of the Karnsteins!” said the\\nold General at length, as from a great window he looked out across the\\nvillage, and saw the wide, undulating expanse of forest. “It was a bad\\nfamily, and here its bloodstained annals were written,” he continued.\\n“It is hard that they should, after death, continue to plague the human\\nrace with their atrocious lusts. That is the chapel of the Karnsteins,\\ndown there.”\\n\\nHe pointed down to the grey walls of the Gothic building partly visible\\nthrough the foliage, a little way down the steep. “And I hear the axe\\nof a woodman,” he added, “busy among the trees that surround it; he\\npossibly may give us the information of which I am in search, and point\\nout the grave of Mircalla, Countess of Karnstein. These rustics\\npreserve the local traditions of great families, whose stories die out\\namong the rich and titled so soon as the families themselves become\\nextinct.”\\n\\n“We have a portrait, at home, of Mircalla, the Countess Karnstein;\\nshould you like to see it?” asked my father.\\n\\n“Time enough, dear friend,” replied the General. “I believe that I have\\nseen the original; and one motive which has led me to you earlier than\\nI at first intended, was to explore the chapel which we are now\\napproaching.”\\n\\n“What! see the Countess Mircalla,” exclaimed my father; “why, she has\\nbeen dead more than a century!”\\n\\n“Not so dead as you fancy, I am told,” answered the General.\\n\\n“I confess, General, you puzzle me utterly,” replied my father, looking\\nat him, I fancied, for a moment with a return of the suspicion I\\ndetected before. But although there was anger and detestation, at\\ntimes, in the old General’s manner, there was nothing flighty.\\n\\n“There remains to me,” he said, as we passed under the heavy arch of\\nthe Gothic church—for its dimensions would have justified its being so\\nstyled—“but one object which can interest me during the few years that\\nremain to me on earth, and that is to wreak on her the vengeance which,\\nI thank God, may still be accomplished by a mortal arm.”\\n\\n“What vengeance can you mean?” asked my father, in increasing\\namazement.\\n\\n“I mean, to decapitate the monster,” he answered, with a fierce flush,\\nand a stamp that echoed mournfully through the hollow ruin, and his\\nclenched hand was at the same moment raised, as if it grasped the\\nhandle of an axe, while he shook it ferociously in the air.\\n\\n“What?” exclaimed my father, more than ever bewildered.\\n\\n“To strike her head off.”\\n\\n“Cut her head off!”\\n\\n“Aye, with a hatchet, with a spade, or with anything that can cleave\\nthrough her murderous throat. You shall hear,” he answered, trembling\\nwith rage. And hurrying forward he said:\\n\\n“That beam will answer for a seat; your dear child is fatigued; let her\\nbe seated, and I will, in a few sentences, close my dreadful story.”\\n\\nThe squared block of wood, which lay on the grass-grown pavement of the\\nchapel, formed a bench on which I was very glad to seat myself, and in\\nthe meantime the General called to the woodman, who had been removing\\nsome boughs which leaned upon the old walls; and, axe in hand, the\\nhardy old fellow stood before us.\\n\\nHe could not tell us anything of these monuments; but there was an old\\nman, he said, a ranger of this forest, at present sojourning in the\\nhouse of the priest, about two miles away, who could point out every\\nmonument of the old Karnstein family; and, for a trifle, he undertook\\nto bring him back with him, if we would lend him one of our horses, in\\nlittle more than half an hour.\\n\\n“Have you been long employed about this forest?” asked my father of the\\nold man.\\n\\n“I have been a woodman here,” he answered in his patois, “under the\\nforester, all my days; so has my father before me, and so on, as many\\ngenerations as I can count up. I could show you the very house in the\\nvillage here, in which my ancestors lived.”\\n\\n“How came the village to be deserted?” asked the General.\\n\\n“It was troubled by revenants, sir; several were tracked to their\\ngraves, there detected by the usual tests, and extinguished in the\\nusual way, by decapitation, by the stake, and by burning; but not until\\nmany of the villagers were killed.\\n\\n“But after all these proceedings according to law,” he continued—“so\\nmany graves opened, and so many vampires deprived of their horrible\\nanimation—the village was not relieved. But a Moravian nobleman, who\\nhappened to be traveling this way, heard how matters were, and being\\nskilled—as many people are in his country—in such affairs, he offered\\nto deliver the village from its tormentor. He did so thus: There being\\na bright moon that night, he ascended, shortly after sunset, the towers\\nof the chapel here, from whence he could distinctly see the churchyard\\nbeneath him; you can see it from that window. From this point he\\nwatched until he saw the vampire come out of his grave, and place near\\nit the linen clothes in which he had been folded, and then glide away\\ntowards the village to plague its inhabitants.\\n\\n“The stranger, having seen all this, came down from the steeple, took\\nthe linen wrappings of the vampire, and carried them up to the top of\\nthe tower, which he again mounted. When the vampire returned from his\\nprowlings and missed his clothes, he cried furiously to the Moravian,\\nwhom he saw at the summit of the tower, and who, in reply, beckoned him\\nto ascend and take them. Whereupon the vampire, accepting his\\ninvitation, began to climb the steeple, and so soon as he had reached\\nthe battlements, the Moravian, with a stroke of his sword, clove his\\nskull in twain, hurling him down to the churchyard, whither, descending\\nby the winding stairs, the stranger followed and cut his head off, and\\nnext day delivered it and the body to the villagers, who duly impaled\\nand burnt them.\\n\\n“This Moravian nobleman had authority from the then head of the family\\nto remove the tomb of Mircalla, Countess Karnstein, which he did\\neffectually, so that in a little while its site was quite forgotten.”\\n\\n“Can you point out where it stood?” asked the General, eagerly.\\n\\nThe forester shook his head, and smiled.\\n\\n“Not a soul living could tell you that now,” he said; “besides, they\\nsay her body was removed; but no one is sure of that either.”\\n\\nHaving thus spoken, as time pressed, he dropped his axe and departed,\\nleaving us to hear the remainder of the General’s strange story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV.\\nThe Meeting\\n\\n\\n“My beloved child,” he resumed, “was now growing rapidly worse. The\\nphysician who attended her had failed to produce the slightest\\nimpression on her disease, for such I then supposed it to be. He saw my\\nalarm, and suggested a consultation. I called in an abler physician,\\nfrom Gratz.\\n\\nSeveral days elapsed before he arrived. He was a good and pious, as\\nwell as a learned man. Having seen my poor ward together, they withdrew\\nto my library to confer and discuss. I, from the adjoining room, where\\nI awaited their summons, heard these two gentlemen’s voices raised in\\nsomething sharper than a strictly philosophical discussion. I knocked\\nat the door and entered. I found the old physician from Gratz\\nmaintaining his theory. His rival was combating it with undisguised\\nridicule, accompanied with bursts of laughter. This unseemly\\nmanifestation subsided and the altercation ended on my entrance.\\n\\n“‘Sir,’ said my first physician,’my learned brother seems to think that\\nyou want a conjuror, and not a doctor.’\\n\\n“‘Pardon me,’ said the old physician from Gratz, looking displeased, ‘I\\nshall state my own view of the case in my own way another time. I\\ngrieve, Monsieur le General, that by my skill and science I can be of\\nno use.\\n\\nBefore I go I shall do myself the honor to suggest something to you.’\\n\\n“He seemed thoughtful, and sat down at a table and began to write.\\n\\nProfoundly disappointed, I made my bow, and as I turned to go, the\\nother doctor pointed over his shoulder to his companion who was\\nwriting, and then, with a shrug, significantly touched his forehead.\\n\\n“This consultation, then, left me precisely where I was. I walked out\\ninto the grounds, all but distracted. The doctor from Gratz, in ten or\\nfifteen minutes, overtook me. He apologized for having followed me, but\\nsaid that he could not conscientiously take his leave without a few\\nwords more. He told me that he could not be mistaken; no natural\\ndisease exhibited the same symptoms; and that death was already very\\nnear. There remained, however, a day, or possibly two, of life. If the\\nfatal seizure were at once arrested, with great care and skill her\\nstrength might possibly return. But all hung now upon the confines of\\nthe irrevocable. One more assault might extinguish the last spark of\\nvitality which is, every moment, ready to die.\\n\\n“‘And what is the nature of the seizure you speak of?’ I entreated.\\n\\n“‘I have stated all fully in this note, which I place in your hands\\nupon the distinct condition that you send for the nearest clergyman,\\nand open my letter in his presence, and on no account read it till he\\nis with you; you would despise it else, and it is a matter of life and\\ndeath. Should the priest fail you, then, indeed, you may read it.’\\n\\n“He asked me, before taking his leave finally, whether I would wish to\\nsee a man curiously learned upon the very subject, which, after I had\\nread his letter, would probably interest me above all others, and he\\nurged me earnestly to invite him to visit him there; and so took his\\nleave.\\n\\n“The ecclesiastic was absent, and I read the letter by myself. At\\nanother time, or in another case, it might have excited my ridicule.\\nBut into what quackeries will not people rush for a last chance, where\\nall accustomed means have failed, and the life of a beloved object is\\nat stake?\\n\\n“Nothing, you will say, could be more absurd than the learned man’s\\nletter.\\n\\nIt was monstrous enough to have consigned him to a madhouse. He said\\nthat the patient was suffering from the visits of a vampire! The\\npunctures which she described as having occurred near the throat, were,\\nhe insisted, the insertion of those two long, thin, and sharp teeth\\nwhich, it is well known, are peculiar to vampires; and there could be\\nno doubt, he added, as to the well-defined presence of the small livid\\nmark which all concurred in describing as that induced by the demon’s\\nlips, and every symptom described by the sufferer was in exact\\nconformity with those recorded in every case of a similar visitation.\\n\\n“Being myself wholly skeptical as to the existence of any such portent\\nas the vampire, the supernatural theory of the good doctor furnished,\\nin my opinion, but another instance of learning and intelligence oddly\\nassociated with some one hallucination. I was so miserable, however,\\nthat, rather than try nothing, I acted upon the instructions of the\\nletter.\\n\\n“I concealed myself in the dark dressing room, that opened upon the\\npoor patient’s room, in which a candle was burning, and watched there\\ntill she was fast asleep. I stood at the door, peeping through the\\nsmall crevice, my sword laid on the table beside me, as my directions\\nprescribed, until, a little after one, I saw a large black object, very\\nill-defined, crawl, as it seemed to me, over the foot of the bed, and\\nswiftly spread itself up to the poor girl’s throat, where it swelled,\\nin a moment, into a great, palpitating mass.\\n\\n“For a few moments I had stood petrified. I now sprang forward, with my\\nsword in my hand. The black creature suddenly contracted towards the\\nfoot of the bed, glided over it, and, standing on the floor about a\\nyard below the foot of the bed, with a glare of skulking ferocity and\\nhorror fixed on me, I saw Millarca. Speculating I know not what, I\\nstruck at her instantly with my sword; but I saw her standing near the\\ndoor, unscathed. Horrified, I pursued, and struck again. She was gone;\\nand my sword flew to shivers against the door.\\n\\n“I can’t describe to you all that passed on that horrible night. The\\nwhole house was up and stirring. The specter Millarca was gone. But her\\nvictim was sinking fast, and before the morning dawned, she died.”\\n\\nThe old General was agitated. We did not speak to him. My father walked\\nto some little distance, and began reading the inscriptions on the\\ntombstones; and thus occupied, he strolled into the door of a side\\nchapel to prosecute his researches. The General leaned against the\\nwall, dried his eyes, and sighed heavily. I was relieved on hearing the\\nvoices of Carmilla and Madame, who were at that moment approaching. The\\nvoices died away.\\n\\nIn this solitude, having just listened to so strange a story,\\nconnected, as it was, with the great and titled dead, whose monuments\\nwere moldering among the dust and ivy round us, and every incident of\\nwhich bore so awfully upon my own mysterious case—in this haunted spot,\\ndarkened by the towering foliage that rose on every side, dense and\\nhigh above its noiseless walls—a horror began to steal over me, and my\\nheart sank as I thought that my friends were, after all, not about to\\nenter and disturb this triste and ominous scene.\\n\\nThe old General’s eyes were fixed on the ground, as he leaned with his\\nhand upon the basement of a shattered monument.\\n\\nUnder a narrow, arched doorway, surmounted by one of those demoniacal\\ngrotesques in which the cynical and ghastly fancy of old Gothic carving\\ndelights, I saw very gladly the beautiful face and figure of Carmilla\\nenter the shadowy chapel.\\n\\nI was just about to rise and speak, and nodded smiling, in answer to\\nher peculiarly engaging smile; when with a cry, the old man by my side\\ncaught up the woodman’s hatchet, and started forward. On seeing him a\\nbrutalized change came over her features. It was an instantaneous and\\nhorrible transformation, as she made a crouching step backwards. Before\\nI could utter a scream, he struck at her with all his force, but she\\ndived under his blow, and unscathed, caught him in her tiny grasp by\\nthe wrist. He struggled for a moment to release his arm, but his hand\\nopened, the axe fell to the ground, and the girl was gone.\\n\\nHe staggered against the wall. His grey hair stood upon his head, and a\\nmoisture shone over his face, as if he were at the point of death.\\n\\nThe frightful scene had passed in a moment. The first thing I recollect\\nafter, is Madame standing before me, and impatiently repeating again\\nand again, the question, “Where is Mademoiselle Carmilla?”\\n\\nI answered at length, “I don’t know—I can’t tell—she went there,” and I\\npointed to the door through which Madame had just entered; “only a\\nminute or two since.”\\n\\n“But I have been standing there, in the passage, ever since\\nMademoiselle Carmilla entered; and she did not return.”\\n\\nShe then began to call “Carmilla,” through every door and passage and\\nfrom the windows, but no answer came.\\n\\n“She called herself Carmilla?” asked the General, still agitated.\\n\\n“Carmilla, yes,” I answered.\\n\\n“Aye,” he said; “that is Millarca. That is the same person who long ago\\nwas called Mircalla, Countess Karnstein. Depart from this accursed\\nground, my poor child, as quickly as you can. Drive to the clergyman’s\\nhouse, and stay there till we come. Begone! May you never behold\\nCarmilla more; you will not find her here.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXV.\\nOrdeal and Execution\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke one of the strangest looking men I ever beheld entered the\\nchapel at the door through which Carmilla had made her entrance and her\\nexit. He was tall, narrow-chested, stooping, with high shoulders, and\\ndressed in black. His face was brown and dried in with deep furrows; he\\nwore an oddly-shaped hat with a broad leaf. His hair, long and\\ngrizzled, hung on his shoulders. He wore a pair of gold spectacles, and\\nwalked slowly, with an odd shambling gait, with his face sometimes\\nturned up to the sky, and sometimes bowed down towards the ground,\\nseemed to wear a perpetual smile; his long thin arms were swinging, and\\nhis lank hands, in old black gloves ever so much too wide for them,\\nwaving and gesticulating in utter abstraction.\\n\\n“The very man!” exclaimed the General, advancing with manifest delight.\\n“My dear Baron, how happy I am to see you, I had no hope of meeting you\\nso soon.” He signed to my father, who had by this time returned, and\\nleading the fantastic old gentleman, whom he called the Baron to meet\\nhim. He introduced him formally, and they at once entered into earnest\\nconversation. The stranger took a roll of paper from his pocket, and\\nspread it on the worn surface of a tomb that stood by. He had a pencil\\ncase in his fingers, with which he traced imaginary lines from point to\\npoint on the paper, which from their often glancing from it, together,\\nat certain points of the building, I concluded to be a plan of the\\nchapel. He accompanied, what I may term, his lecture, with occasional\\nreadings from a dirty little book, whose yellow leaves were closely\\nwritten over.\\n\\nThey sauntered together down the side aisle, opposite to the spot where\\nI was standing, conversing as they went; then they began measuring\\ndistances by paces, and finally they all stood together, facing a piece\\nof the sidewall, which they began to examine with great minuteness;\\npulling off the ivy that clung over it, and rapping the plaster with\\nthe ends of their sticks, scraping here, and knocking there. At length\\nthey ascertained the existence of a broad marble tablet, with letters\\ncarved in relief upon it.\\n\\nWith the assistance of the woodman, who soon returned, a monumental\\ninscription, and carved escutcheon, were disclosed. They proved to be\\nthose of the long lost monument of Mircalla, Countess Karnstein.\\n\\nThe old General, though not I fear given to the praying mood, raised\\nhis hands and eyes to heaven, in mute thanksgiving for some moments.\\n\\n“Tomorrow,” I heard him say; “the commissioner will be here, and the\\nInquisition will be held according to law.”\\n\\nThen turning to the old man with the gold spectacles, whom I have\\ndescribed, he shook him warmly by both hands and said:\\n\\n“Baron, how can I thank you? How can we all thank you? You will have\\ndelivered this region from a plague that has scourged its inhabitants\\nfor more than a century. The horrible enemy, thank God, is at last\\ntracked.”\\n\\nMy father led the stranger aside, and the General followed. I know that\\nhe had led them out of hearing, that he might relate my case, and I saw\\nthem glance often quickly at me, as the discussion proceeded.\\n\\nMy father came to me, kissed me again and again, and leading me from\\nthe chapel, said:\\n\\n“It is time to return, but before we go home, we must add to our party\\nthe good priest, who lives but a little way from this; and persuade him\\nto accompany us to the schloss.”\\n\\nIn this quest we were successful: and I was glad, being unspeakably\\nfatigued when we reached home. But my satisfaction was changed to\\ndismay, on discovering that there were no tidings of Carmilla. Of the\\nscene that had occurred in the ruined chapel, no explanation was\\noffered to me, and it was clear that it was a secret which my father\\nfor the present determined to keep from me.\\n\\nThe sinister absence of Carmilla made the remembrance of the scene more\\nhorrible to me. The arrangements for the night were singular. Two\\nservants, and Madame were to sit up in my room that night; and the\\necclesiastic with my father kept watch in the adjoining dressing room.\\n\\nThe priest had performed certain solemn rites that night, the purport\\nof which I did not understand any more than I comprehended the reason\\nof this extraordinary precaution taken for my safety during sleep.\\n\\nI saw all clearly a few days later.\\n\\nThe disappearance of Carmilla was followed by the discontinuance of my\\nnightly sufferings.\\n\\nYou have heard, no doubt, of the appalling superstition that prevails\\nin Upper and Lower Styria, in Moravia, Silesia, in Turkish Serbia, in\\nPoland, even in Russia; the superstition, so we must call it, of the\\nVampire.\\n\\nIf human testimony, taken with every care and solemnity, judicially,\\nbefore commissions innumerable, each consisting of many members, all\\nchosen for integrity and intelligence, and constituting reports more\\nvoluminous perhaps than exist upon any one other class of cases, is\\nworth anything, it is difficult to deny, or even to doubt the existence\\nof such a phenomenon as the Vampire.\\n\\nFor my part I have heard no theory by which to explain what I myself\\nhave witnessed and experienced, other than that supplied by the ancient\\nand well-attested belief of the country.\\n\\nThe next day the formal proceedings took place in the Chapel of\\nKarnstein.\\n\\nThe grave of the Countess Mircalla was opened; and the General and my\\nfather recognized each his perfidious and beautiful guest, in the face\\nnow disclosed to view. The features, though a hundred and fifty years\\nhad passed since her funeral, were tinted with the warmth of life. Her\\neyes were open; no cadaverous smell exhaled from the coffin. The two\\nmedical men, one officially present, the other on the part of the\\npromoter of the inquiry, attested the marvelous fact that there was a\\nfaint but appreciable respiration, and a corresponding action of the\\nheart. The limbs were perfectly flexible, the flesh elastic; and the\\nleaden coffin floated with blood, in which to a depth of seven inches,\\nthe body lay immersed.\\n\\nHere then, were all the admitted signs and proofs of vampirism. The\\nbody, therefore, in accordance with the ancient practice, was raised,\\nand a sharp stake driven through the heart of the vampire, who uttered\\na piercing shriek at the moment, in all respects such as might escape\\nfrom a living person in the last agony. Then the head was struck off,\\nand a torrent of blood flowed from the severed neck. The body and head\\nwas next placed on a pile of wood, and reduced to ashes, which were\\nthrown upon the river and borne away, and that territory has never\\nsince been plagued by the visits of a vampire.\\n\\nMy father has a copy of the report of the Imperial Commission, with the\\nsignatures of all who were present at these proceedings, attached in\\nverification of the statement. It is from this official paper that I\\nhave summarized my account of this last shocking scene.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVI.\\nConclusion\\n\\n\\nI write all this you suppose with composure. But far from it; I cannot\\nthink of it without agitation. Nothing but your earnest desire so\\nrepeatedly expressed, could have induced me to sit down to a task that\\nhas unstrung my nerves for months to come, and reinduced a shadow of\\nthe unspeakable horror which years after my deliverance continued to\\nmake my days and nights dreadful, and solitude insupportably terrific.\\n\\nLet me add a word or two about that quaint Baron Vordenburg, to whose\\ncurious lore we were indebted for the discovery of the Countess\\nMircalla’s grave.\\n\\nHe had taken up his abode in Gratz, where, living upon a mere pittance,\\nwhich was all that remained to him of the once princely estates of his\\nfamily, in Upper Styria, he devoted himself to the minute and laborious\\ninvestigation of the marvelously authenticated tradition of Vampirism.\\nHe had at his fingers’ ends all the great and little works upon the\\nsubject.\\n\\n“Magia Posthuma,” “Phlegon de Mirabilibus,” “Augustinus de cura pro\\nMortuis,” “Philosophicae et Christianae Cogitationes de Vampiris,” by\\nJohn Christofer Herenberg; and a thousand others, among which I\\nremember only a few of those which he lent to my father. He had a\\nvoluminous digest of all the judicial cases, from which he had\\nextracted a system of principles that appear to govern—some always, and\\nothers occasionally only—the condition of the vampire. I may mention,\\nin passing, that the deadly pallor attributed to that sort of\\nrevenants, is a mere melodramatic fiction. They present, in the grave,\\nand when they show themselves in human society, the appearance of\\nhealthy life. When disclosed to light in their coffins, they exhibit\\nall the symptoms that are enumerated as those which proved the\\nvampire-life of the long-dead Countess Karnstein.\\n\\nHow they escape from their graves and return to them for certain hours\\nevery day, without displacing the clay or leaving any trace of\\ndisturbance in the state of the coffin or the cerements, has always\\nbeen admitted to be utterly inexplicable. The amphibious existence of\\nthe vampire is sustained by daily renewed slumber in the grave. Its\\nhorrible lust for living blood supplies the vigor of its waking\\nexistence. The vampire is prone to be fascinated with an engrossing\\nvehemence, resembling the passion of love, by particular persons. In\\npursuit of these it will exercise inexhaustible patience and stratagem,\\nfor access to a particular object may be obstructed in a hundred ways.\\nIt will never desist until it has satiated its passion, and drained the\\nvery life of its coveted victim. But it will, in these cases, husband\\nand protract its murderous enjoyment with the refinement of an epicure,\\nand heighten it by the gradual approaches of an artful courtship. In\\nthese cases it seems to yearn for something like sympathy and consent.\\nIn ordinary ones it goes direct to its object, overpowers with\\nviolence, and strangles and exhausts often at a single feast.\\n\\nThe vampire is, apparently, subject, in certain situations, to special\\nconditions. In the particular instance of which I have given you a\\nrelation, Mircalla seemed to be limited to a name which, if not her\\nreal one, should at least reproduce, without the omission or addition\\nof a single letter, those, as we say, anagrammatically, which compose\\nit.\\n\\nCarmilla did this; so did Millarca.\\n\\nMy father related to the Baron Vordenburg, who remained with us for two\\nor three weeks after the expulsion of Carmilla, the story about the\\nMoravian nobleman and the vampire at Karnstein churchyard, and then he\\nasked the Baron how he had discovered the exact position of the\\nlong-concealed tomb of the Countess Mircalla? The Baron’s grotesque\\nfeatures puckered up into a mysterious smile; he looked down, still\\nsmiling on his worn spectacle case and fumbled with it. Then looking\\nup, he said:\\n\\n“I have many journals, and other papers, written by that remarkable\\nman; the most curious among them is one treating of the visit of which\\nyou speak, to Karnstein. The tradition, of course, discolors and\\ndistorts a little. He might have been termed a Moravian nobleman, for\\nhe had changed his abode to that territory, and was, beside, a noble.\\nBut he was, in truth, a native of Upper Styria. It is enough to say\\nthat in very early youth he had been a passionate and favored lover of\\nthe beautiful Mircalla, Countess Karnstein. Her early death plunged him\\ninto inconsolable grief. It is the nature of vampires to increase and\\nmultiply, but according to an ascertained and ghostly law.\\n\\n“Assume, at starting, a territory perfectly free from that pest. How\\ndoes it begin, and how does it multiply itself? I will tell you. A\\nperson, more or less wicked, puts an end to himself. A suicide, under\\ncertain circumstances, becomes a vampire. That specter visits living\\npeople in their slumbers; they die, and almost invariably, in the\\ngrave, develop into vampires. This happened in the case of the\\nbeautiful Mircalla, who was haunted by one of those demons. My\\nancestor, Vordenburg, whose title I still bear, soon discovered this,\\nand in the course of the studies to which he devoted himself, learned a\\ngreat deal more.\\n\\n“Among other things, he concluded that suspicion of vampirism would\\nprobably fall, sooner or later, upon the dead Countess, who in life had\\nbeen his idol. He conceived a horror, be she what she might, of her\\nremains being profaned by the outrage of a posthumous execution. He has\\nleft a curious paper to prove that the vampire, on its expulsion from\\nits amphibious existence, is projected into a far more horrible life;\\nand he resolved to save his once beloved Mircalla from this.\\n\\n“He adopted the stratagem of a journey here, a pretended removal of her\\nremains, and a real obliteration of her monument. When age had stolen\\nupon him, and from the vale of years, he looked back on the scenes he\\nwas leaving, he considered, in a different spirit, what he had done,\\nand a horror took possession of him. He made the tracings and notes\\nwhich have guided me to the very spot, and drew up a confession of the\\ndeception that he had practiced. If he had intended any further action\\nin this matter, death prevented him; and the hand of a remote\\ndescendant has, too late for many, directed the pursuit to the lair of\\nthe beast.”\\n\\nWe talked a little more, and among other things he said was this:\\n\\n“One sign of the vampire is the power of the hand. The slender hand of\\nMircalla closed like a vice of steel on the General’s wrist when he\\nraised the hatchet to strike. But its power is not confined to its\\ngrasp; it leaves a numbness in the limb it seizes, which is slowly, if\\never, recovered from.”\\n\\nThe following Spring my father took me a tour through Italy. We\\nremained away for more than a year. It was long before the terror of\\nrecent events subsided; and to this hour the image of Carmilla returns\\nto memory with ambiguous alternations—sometimes the playful, languid,\\nbeautiful girl; sometimes the writhing fiend I saw in the ruined\\nchurch; and often from a reverie I have started, fancying I heard the\\nlight step of Carmilla at the drawing room door.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER I.\\n\\nPUTTING ON THE SCREW.\\n\\nThe cold on the 8th of February, 186-, was more intense than the\\nParisians had experienced during the whole of the severe winter\\nwhich had preceded it, for at twelve o’clock on that day Chevalier’s\\nthermometer, so well known by the denizens of Paris, registered three\\ndegrees below zero. The sky was overcast and full of threatening signs\\nof snow, while the moisture on the pavement and roads had frozen hard,\\nrendering traffic of all kinds exceedingly hazardous. The whole great\\ncity wore an air of dreariness and desolation, for even when a thin\\ncrust of ice covers the waters of the Seine, the mind involuntarily\\nturns to those who have neither food, shelter, nor fuel.\\n\\nThis bitterly cold day actually made the landlady of the Hotel de Perou,\\nthough she was a hard, grasping woman of Auvergne, give a thought to the\\ncondition of her lodgers, and one quite different from her usual idea of\\nobtaining the maximum of rent for the minimum of accommodation.\\n\\n“The cold,” remarked she to her husband, who was busily engaged in\\nreplenishing the stove with fuel, “is enough to frighten the wits out of\\na Polar bear. In this kind of weather I always feel very anxious, for\\nit was during a winter like this that one of our lodgers hung himself, a\\ntrick which cost us fifty francs, in good, honest money, besides giving\\nus a bad name in the neighborhood. The fact is, one never knows what\\nlodgers are capable of doing. You should go up to the top floor, and see\\nhow they are getting on there.”\\n\\n“Pooh, pooh!” replied her husband, M. Loupins; “they will do well\\nenough.”\\n\\n“Is that really your opinion?”\\n\\n“I know that I am right. Daddy Tantaine went out as soon as it was\\nlight, and a short time afterward Paul Violaine came down. There is no\\none upstairs now but little Rose, and I expect that she has been wise\\nenough to stick to her bed.”\\n\\n“Ah!” answered the landlady rather spitefully. “I have made up my mind\\nregarding that young lady some time ago; she is a sight too pretty for\\nthis house, and so I tell you.”\\n\\nThe Hotel de Perou stands in the Rue de la Hachette, not twenty steps\\nfrom the Place de Petit Pont; and no more cruelly sarcastic title could\\never have been conferred on a building. The extreme shabbiness of the\\nexterior of the house, the narrow, muddy street in which it stood,\\nthe dingy windows covered with mud, and repaired with every variety of\\npatch,--all seemed to cry out to the passers by: “This is the chosen\\nabode of misery and destitution.”\\n\\nThe observer might have fancied it a robbers’ den, but he would have\\nbeen wrong; for the inhabitants were fairly honest. The Hotel de Perou\\nwas one of those refuges, growing scarcer and more scarce every day,\\nwhere unhappy men and women, who had been worsted in the battle of life,\\ncould find a shelter in return for the change remaining from the last\\nfive-franc piece. They treat it as the shipwrecked mariner uses the rock\\nupon which he climbs from the whirl of the angry waters, and breathes\\na deep sigh of relief as he collects his forces for a fresh effort.\\nHowever wretched existence may be, a protracted sojourn in such a\\nshelter as the Hotel de Perou would be out of the question. The chambers\\nin every floor of the house are divided into small slips by partitions,\\ncovered with canvas and paper, and pleasantly termed rooms by M.\\nLoupins. The partitions were in a terrible condition, rickety and\\nunstable, and the paper with which they were covered torn and hanging\\ndown in tatters; but the state of the attics was even more deplorable,\\nthe ceilings of which were so low that the occupants had to stoop\\ncontinually, while the dormer windows admitted but a small amount of\\nlight. A bedstead, with a straw mattress, a rickety table, and two\\nbroken chairs, formed the sole furniture of these rooms. Miserable\\nas these dormitories were, the landlady asked and obtained twenty-two\\nfrancs for them by the month, as there was a fireplace in each, which\\nshe always pointed out to intending tenants.\\n\\nThe young woman whom M. Loupins alluded to by the name of Rose was\\nseated in one of these dreary dens on this bitter winter’s day. Rose was\\nan exquisitely beautiful girl about eighteen years of age. She was very\\nfair; her long lashes partially concealed a pair of steely blue eyes,\\nand to a certain extent relieved their hard expression. Her ripe, red\\nlips, which seemed formed for love and kisses, permitted a glimpse of\\na row of pearly teeth. Her bright waving hair grew low down upon her\\nforehead, and such of it as had escaped from the bondage of a cheap\\ncomb, with which it was fastened, hung in wild luxuriance over her\\nexquisitely shaped neck and shoulders. She had thrown over her ragged\\nprint gown the patched coverlet of the bed, and, crouched upon\\nthe tattered hearthrug before the hearth, upon which a few sticks\\nsmouldered, giving out hardly a particle of heat, she was telling her\\nfortune with a dirty pack of cards, endeavoring to console herself for\\nthe privations of the day by the promise of future prosperity. She had\\nspread those arbiters of her destiny in a half circle before her, and\\ndivided them into threes, each of which had a peculiar meaning, and her\\nbreast rose and fell as she turned them up and read upon their faces\\ngood fortune or ill-luck. Absorbed in this task, she paid but little\\nattention to the icy chilliness of the atmosphere, which made her\\nfingers stiff, and dyed her white hands purple.\\n\\n“One, two, three,” she murmured in a low voice. “A fair man, that’s\\nsure to be Paul. One, two, three, money to the house. One, two, three,\\ntroubles and vexations. One, two, three, the nine of spades; ah, dear!\\nmore hardships and misery,--always that wretched card turning up with\\nits sad story!”\\n\\nRose seemed utterly downcast at the sight of the little piece of painted\\ncardboard, as though she had received certain intelligence of a\\ncoming misfortune. She soon, however, recovered herself, and was again\\nshuffling the pack,--cut it, taking care to do so with her left hand,\\nspread them out before her, and again commenced counting: one, two,\\nthree. This time the cards appeared to be more propitious, and held out\\npromises of success for the future.\\n\\n“I am loved,” read she, as she gazed anxiously upon them,--“very much\\nloved! Here is rejoicing, and a letter from a dark man! See, here he\\nis,--the knave of clubs. Always the same,” she continued; “I cannot\\nstrive against fate.”\\n\\nThen, rising to her feet, she drew from a crack in the wall, which\\nformed a safe hiding-place for her secrets, a soiled and crumpled\\nletter, and, unfolding it, she read for perhaps the hundredth time these\\nwords:--\\n\\n“MADEMOISELLE,--\\n\\n“To see you is to love you. I give you my word of honor that this is\\ntrue. The wretched hovel where your charms are hidden is no fit\\nabode for you. A home, worthy in every way to receive you, is at\\nyour service--Rue de Douai. It has been taken in your name, as I am\\nstraightforward in these matters. Think of my proposal, and make what\\ninquiries you like concerning me. I have not yet attained my majority,\\nbut shall do so in five months and three days, when I shall inherit my\\nmother’s fortune. My father is wealthy, but old and infirm. From four to\\nsix in the afternoon of the next few days I will be in a carriage at the\\ncorner of the Place de Petit Pont.\\n\\n“GASTON DE GANDELU.”\\n\\n\\nThe cynical insolence of the letter, together with its entire want of\\nform, was a perfect example of the style affected by those loiterers\\nabout town, known to the Parisians as “mashers;” and yet Rose did not\\nappear at all disgusted by the reception of such an unworthily worded\\nproposal, but, on the contrary, rather pleased by its contents. “If I\\nonly dared,” mused she, with a sigh,--“ah, if I only dared!” For a time\\nshe sat deeply immersed in thought, with her face buried in her hands,\\nuntil she was aroused from her meditations by the sound of an active and\\nyouthful step upon the creaking stairs. “He has come back,” she gasped;\\nand with the agile movement of a cat she again concealed the letter\\nin its hiding-place, and she had scarcely done so, when Paul Violaine\\nentered the miserable room. He was a young man of twenty-three, of\\nslender figure, but admirably proportioned. His face was a perfect oval,\\nand his complexion of just that slight olive tint which betrays the\\nnative of the south of France. A slight, silky moustache concealed his\\nupper lip, and gave his features that air of manliness in which they\\nwould have otherwise been deficient. His curly chestnut hair fell\\ngracefully over a brow upon which an expression of pride was visible,\\nand enhanced the peculiar, restless glance of his large dark eyes. His\\nphysical beauty, which was fully equal to that of Rose, was increased by\\nan aristocratic air, popularly believed to be only found in the scions\\nof noble families. The landlady, in her moments of good humor, used to\\nassert her belief that her lodger was a disguised prince; but if this\\nwere the case, he was certainly one that had been overtaken by poverty.\\nHis dress, to which the closest attention had been paid, revealed the\\nstate of destitution in which he was,--not the destitution which openly\\nasks for alms, but the hidden poverty which shuns communication and\\nblushes at a single glance of pity. In this almost Arctic winter he wore\\nclothes rendered thin by the constant friction of the clothes brush,\\nover which was a light overcoat about as thick as the web of a spider.\\nHis shoes were well blacked, but their condition told the piteous tale\\nof long walks in search of employment, or of that good luck which seems\\nto evade its pursuer.\\n\\nPaul was holding a roll of manuscript in his hand, and as he entered\\nthe room he threw it on the bed with a despairing gesture. “A failure\\nagain!” exclaimed he, in accents of the utmost depression. “Nothing else\\nbut failures!”\\n\\nThe young woman rose hastily to her feet; she appeared to have forgotten\\nthe cards completely; the smile of satisfaction faded from her face and\\nher features, and an expression of utter weariness took its place.\\n\\n“What! no success?” she cried, affecting a surprise which was evidently\\nassumed. “No success, after all your promises when you left me this\\nmorning?”\\n\\n“This morning, Rose, a ray of hope had penetrated my heart; but I have\\nbeen deceived, or rather I deceived myself, and I took my ardent desires\\nfor so many promises which were certain to be fulfilled. The people that\\nI have been to have not even the kindness to say ‘No’ plain and flat;\\nthey listen to all you have to say, and as soon as your back is turned\\nthey forget your existence. The coin that passes around in this\\ninfernal town is indeed nothing but idle words, and that is all that\\npoverty-stricken talent can expect.”\\n\\nA silence of some duration ensued, and Paul was too much absorbed in\\nhis own thoughts to notice the look of contempt with which Rose was\\nregarding him. His helpless resignation to adverse circumstances\\nappeared to have turned her to stone.\\n\\n“A nice position we are in!” said she at last. “What do you think will\\nbecome of us?”\\n\\n“Alas! I do not know.”\\n\\n“Nor I. Yesterday Madame Loupins came to me and asked for the eleven\\nfrancs we owe here; and told me plainly that if within three days we did\\nnot settle our account, she would turn us out; and I know enough of her\\nto be sure that she will keep her word. The detestable old hag would do\\nanything for the pleasure of seeing me on the streets.”\\n\\n“Alone and friendless in the world,” muttered Paul, paying but little\\nattention to the young girl’s words, “without a creature or a relative\\nto care for you, or to lend you a helping hand.”\\n\\n“We have not a copper in the world,” continued Rose with cruel\\npersistency; “I have sold everything that I had, to preserve the rags\\nthat I am wearing. Not a scrap of wood remains, and we have not tasted\\nfood since yesterday morning.”\\n\\nTo these words, which were uttered in a tone of the most bitter\\nreproach, the young man made no reply, but clasped his icily cold hands\\nagainst his forehead, as though in utter despair.\\n\\n“Yes, that is a true picture of our position,” resumed Rose coldly,\\nher accents growing more and more contemptuous. “And I tell you that\\nsomething must be done at once, some means discovered, I care not what,\\nto relieve us from our present miserable state.”\\n\\nPaul tore off his overcoat, and held it toward her.\\n\\n“Take it, and pawn it,” exclaimed he; but the girl made no move.\\n\\n“Is that all that you have to propose?” asked she, in the same glacial\\ntone.\\n\\n“They will lend you three francs upon it, and with that we can get bread\\nand fuel.”\\n\\n“And after that is gone?”\\n\\n“After that--oh, we will think of our next step, and shall have time to\\nhit upon some plan. Time, a little time, is all that I require, Rose, to\\nbreak asunder the bonds which seem to fetter me. Some day success must\\ncrown my efforts; and with success, Rose, dear, will come affluence, but\\nin the meantime we must learn to wait.”\\n\\n“And where are the means to enable us to wait?”\\n\\n“No matter; they will come. Only do what I tell you, and who can say\\nwhat to-morrow----”\\n\\nPaul was still too much absorbed in his own thoughts to notice the\\nexpression upon the young girl’s face; for had he done so, he would at\\nonce have perceived that she was not in the humor to permit the matter\\nto be shelved in this manner.\\n\\n“To-morrow!” she broke in sarcastically. “To-morrow,--always the same\\npitiful cry. For months past we seem to have lived upon the word. Look\\nyou here, Paul, you are no longer a child, and ought to be able to look\\nthings straight in the face. What can I get on that threadbare coat of\\nyours? Perhaps three francs at the outside. How many days will that\\nlast us? We will say three. And then, what then? Besides, can you not\\nunderstand that your dress is too shabby for you to make an impression\\non the people you go to see? Well-dressed applicants only have\\nattention, and to obtain money, you must appear not to need it; and,\\npray, what will people think of you if you have no overcoat? Without one\\nyou will look ridiculous, and can hardly venture into the streets.”\\n\\n“Hush!” cried Paul, “for pity’s sake, hush! for your words only prove to\\nme more plainly that you are like the rest of the world, and that want\\nof success is a pernicious crime in your eyes. You once had confidence\\nin me, and then you spoke in a very different strain.”\\n\\n“Once indeed! but then I did not know--”\\n\\n“No, Rose, it was not what you were then ignorant of; but it was that in\\nthose days you loved me.\\n\\n“Great heavens! I ask you, have I left one stone unturned? Have I\\nnot gone from publisher to publisher to sell those songs of my own\\ncomposing--those songs that you sing so well? I have endeavored to get\\npupils. What fresh efforts can I try? What would _you_ do, were you in\\nmy place? Tell me, I beg you.”\\n\\nAnd as Paul spoke, he grew more and more excited, while Rose still\\nmaintained her manner of exasperating coolness.\\n\\n“I know not,” she replied, after a brief pause; “but if I were a man, I\\ndo not think I would permit the woman, for whom I pretended that I had\\nthe most sincere affection, to be in want of the actual necessities of\\nlife. I would strain every effort to obtain them.”\\n\\n“I have no trade; I am no mechanic,” broke in Paul passionately.\\n\\n“Then I would learn one. Pray how much does a man earn who climbs the\\nladder with a bricklayer’s hod upon his shoulders? It may be hard work,\\nI know, but surely the business is not difficult to learn. You have, or\\nsay you have, great musical talents. I say nothing about them; but had\\nI any vocal powers and if there was not a morsel to eat in the house,\\nI would go and sing in the taverns or even in the public streets, and\\nwould earn money, and care little for the means by which I made it.”\\n\\n“When you say those things, you seem to forget that I am an honest man.”\\n\\n“One would really suppose that I had suggested some questionable act to\\nyou. Your reply, Paul, plainly proves to me that you are one of those\\nwho, for want of determination, fall, helpless, by the wayside in the\\njourney of life. They flaunt their rags and tatters in the eyes of the\\nworld, and with saddened hearts and empty stomachs utter the boast,\\n‘I am an honest man.’ Do you think that, in order to be rich, you must\\nperforce be a rogue? This is simple imbecility.”\\n\\nShe uttered this tirade in clear and vibrant accents, and her eyes\\ngleamed with the fire of savage resolution. Her nature was one of those\\ncruel and energetic ones, which lead a woman to hurl a man from the\\nbrink of the abyss to which she had conducted him, and to forget him\\nbefore he has ever reached the bottom.\\n\\nThis torrent of sarcasm brought out Paul’s real nature. His face\\nflushed, and rage began to gain the mastery over him. “Can you not\\nwork?” he asked. “Why do you not do something instead of talking so\\nmuch?”\\n\\n“That is not at all the same thing,” answered she coolly. “I was not\\nmade for work.”\\n\\nPaul made a threatening gesture. “You wretch!” exclaimed he.\\n\\n“You are wrong,” she replied. “I am not a wretch; I am simply hungry.”\\n\\nThere seemed every prospect of an angry scene, when a slight sound\\nattracted the attention of the disputants, and, turning round, they saw\\nan old man standing upon the threshold of their open door. He was tall,\\nbut stooped a good deal. He had high, thick brows, and a red nose; a\\nlong, thick, grizzly beard covered the rest of his countenance. He wore\\na pair of spectacles with colored glasses, which, to a great extent,\\nconcealed the expression of his face. His whole attire indicated extreme\\npoverty. He wore a greasy coat, much frayed and torn at the pockets, and\\nwhich had carried away with it marks of all the walls against which it\\nhad been rubbed when he had indulged a little too freely in the cheerful\\nglass. He seemed to belong to that class who consider it a work of\\nsupererogation to disrobe before going to bed, and who just turn in on\\nsuch spot as the fancy of the moment may dictate. Paul and Rose both\\nrecognized the old man from having continually met him when ascending\\nor descending the staircase, and knew that he rented the back attic, and\\nwas called Daddy Tantaine. In an instant the idea flashed across Paul’s\\nmind that the dilapidated state of the partition permitted every word\\nspoken in one attic to be overheard in the other, and this did not tend\\nto soothe his exasperated feelings.\\n\\n“What do you want here, sir?” asked he angrily. “And, pray, who gave you\\npermission to enter my room without leave?”\\n\\nThe old man did not seem at all put out by the threatening language of\\nhis questioner. “I should be telling a fib,” answered he calmly, “if I\\nwere to tell you that, being in my own room and hearing you quarrelling,\\nI did not hear every word of what you have been saying.”\\n\\n“Sir!”\\n\\n“Stop a bit, and don’t be in such a hurry, my young friend. You seem\\ndisposed to quarrel, and, on my faith, I am not surprised; for when\\nthere is no corn in the manger, the best tempered horse will bite and\\nkick.”\\n\\nHe uttered these words in the most soothing accents, and appeared\\nutterly unconscious of having committed any breach of etiquette in\\nentering the room.\\n\\n“Well, sir,” said Paul, a flush of shame passing across his face, “you\\nsee now how poverty can drag a man down. Are you satisfied?”\\n\\n“Come, come, my young friend,” answered Daddy Tantaine, “you should not\\nget angry; and if I did step in without any notice, it was because, as a\\nneighbor, I find I might venture on such a liberty; for when I heard how\\nembarrassed you were, I said to myself, ‘Tantaine, perhaps you can help\\nthis pretty pair out of the scrape they have got into.’”\\n\\nThe promise of assistance from a person who had not certainly the\\noutward appearance of a capitalist seemed so ludicrous to Rose that she\\ncould not restrain a smile, for she fancied that if their old neighbor\\nwas to present them with half his fortune, it might possibly amount to\\ntwenty centimes or thereabouts.\\n\\nPaul had formed a somewhat similar idea, but he was a little touched by\\nthis act of friendliness on the part of a man who doubtless knew that\\nmoney lent under similar circumstances was but seldom returned.\\n\\n“Ah, sir!” said he, and this time he spoke in softer accents, “what can\\nyou possibly do for us?”\\n\\n“Who can say?”\\n\\n“You can see how hard we are pushed. We are in want of almost\\neverything. Have we not reached the _acme_ of misery?”\\n\\nThe old man raised his hand to heaven, as if to seek for aid from above.\\n\\n“You have indeed come to a terrible pass,” murmured he; “but all is not\\nyet lost. The pearl which lies in the depths of the ocean is not lost\\nfor ever; for may not some skillful diver bring it to the surface? A\\nfisherman may not be able to do much with it, but he knows something of\\nits value, and hands it over to the dealer in precious stones.”\\n\\nHe intensified his speech by a little significant laugh, the meaning\\nof which was lost upon the two young people who, though their evil\\ninstincts led them to be greedy and covetous, were yet unskilled in the\\nworld’s ways.\\n\\n“I should,” remarked Paul, “be a fool if I did not accept the offer of\\nyour kind assistance.”\\n\\n“There, then, that is right; and now the first thing to do is to have a\\nreally good feed. You must get in some wood too, for it is frightfully\\ncold. My old bones are half frozen; and afterward we will talk of a\\nfresh rig out for you both.”\\n\\n“Yes,” remarked Rose with a faint sigh; “but to do all that, we want a\\nlot of money.”\\n\\n“Well, how do you know that I can’t find it?”\\n\\nDaddy Tantaine unbuttoned his great coat with grave deliberation, and\\ndrew from an inner pocket a small scrap of paper which had been fastened\\nto the lining by a pin. This he unfolded with the greatest of care and\\nlaid upon the table.\\n\\n“A banknote for five hundred francs!” exclaimed Rose, with extreme\\nsurprise. Paul did not utter a word. Had he seen the woodwork of the\\nchair upon which he was leaning burst into flower and leaf, he could not\\nhave looked more surprised. Who could have expected to find such a sum\\nconcealed beneath the old man’s tatters, and how could he have obtained\\nso much money? The idea that some robbery had been committed at once\\noccurred to both the young people, and they exchanged a meaning glance,\\nwhich, however, did not escape the observation of their visitor.\\n\\n“Pooh, pooh!” said he, without appearing in the slightest degree\\nannoyed. “You must not give way to evil thoughts or suspicions. It is\\na fact that banknotes for five hundred francs don’t often grow out of\\na ragged pocket like mine. But I got this fellow honestly,--that I can\\nguarantee.”\\n\\nRose paid no attention to his words; indeed, she took no interest in\\nthem. The note was there, and that was enough for her. She took it up\\nand smoothed it out as though the crisp paper communicated a pleasant\\nsensation to her fingers.\\n\\n“I must tell you,” resumed Daddy Tantaine, “that I am employed by a\\nsheriff’s officer, and that, in addition, I do a little bill collecting\\nfor various persons. By these means I have often comparatively large\\nsums in my possession, and I can lend you five hundred francs for a\\nshort time without any inconvenience to myself.”\\n\\nPaul’s necessities and conscience were fighting a hard battle, and\\nhe remained silent, as a person generally does before arriving at a\\nmomentous decision.\\n\\nAt length he broke the silence. “No,” said he, “your offer is one that I\\ncannot accept, for I feel--”\\n\\n“This is no time, my dear Paul, to talk of feelings,” interrupted Rose;\\n“besides, can you not see that our refusal to accept the loan annoys\\nthis worthy gentleman?”\\n\\n“The young lady is quite right,” returned Daddy Tantaine. “Come, let\\nus say that the matter is settled. Go out and get in something to eat,\\nsharp, for it has struck four some time ago.”\\n\\nAt these words, Rose started, and a scarlet flush spread over her\\ncheek. “Four o’clock,” repeated she, thinking of her letter; but after a\\nmoment’s reflection she stepped up to the cracked mirror, and arranging\\nher tattered skirts, took up the banknote and left the room.\\n\\n“She is a rare beauty,” remarked Daddy Tantaine with the air of one who\\nwas an authority in such matters, “and as clever as they make them.\\nAh! if she had only some one to give her a hint, she might rise to any\\nheight.”\\n\\nPaul’s ideas were in such a wild state of confusion, that he could\\nmake no reply; and, now that he was no longer held in thrall by Rose’s\\npresence, he began to be terrified at what had taken place, for he\\nimagined that he caught a sinister expression in the old man’s face\\nwhich made him very suspicious of the wisdom of the course he had been\\npersuaded to pursue. Was there ever such an unheard-of event as an old\\nman of such a poverty-stricken appearance showering banknotes upon the\\nheads of perfect strangers? There was certainly something mysterious\\nin the affair, and Paul made up his mind that he would do his utmost to\\navoid being compromised.\\n\\n“I have thought the matter over,” said he resolutely; “and it is\\nimpossible for me to accept the loan of a sum which it would be\\ndifficult for me to repay.”\\n\\n“My dear young friend, that is not the way to talk. If you do not have a\\ngood opinion of yourself, all the world will judge you according to your\\nown estimation. Your inexperience has, up to this time, been the sole\\ncause of your failure. Poverty soon changes a boy into a man as straw\\nripens fruit; but the first thing you must do is to put all confidence\\nin me. You can repay the five hundred francs at your convenience, but I\\nmust have six per cent. for my money and your note of hand.”\\n\\n“But really--,” began Paul.\\n\\n“I am looking at the matter in a purely business light, so we can drop\\nsentiment.”\\n\\nPaul had so little experience in the ways of the world, that the mere\\nfact of giving his acceptance for the money borrowed put him at once\\nat his ease, though he knew well that his name was not a very valuable\\naddition to the slip of paper.\\n\\nDaddy Tantaine, after a short search through his pockets, discovered\\na bill stamp, and, placing it on the table, said, “Write as I shall\\ndictate:--\\n\\n‘On the 8th of June, 188-, I promise to pay to M. Tantaine or order the\\nsum of five hundred francs for value received, such sum to bear interest\\nat the rate of six per cent. per annum.\\n\\n‘Frs. 500.\\n\\n‘PAUL VIOLAINE.’”\\n\\n\\nThe young man had just completed his signature when Rose made her\\nappearance, bearing a plentiful stock of provisions in her arms. Her\\neyes had a strange radiance in them, which Paul, however, did not\\nnotice, as he was engaged in watching the old man, who, after carefully\\ninspecting the document, secured it in one of the pockets of his ragged\\ncoat.\\n\\n“You will, of course, understand, sir,” remarked Paul, “that there is\\nnot much chance of my being able to save sufficient to meet this bill in\\nfour months, so that the date is a mere form.”\\n\\nA smile of benevolence passed over Daddy Tantaine’s features. “And\\nsuppose,” said he, “that I, the lender, was to put the borrower in a\\nposition to repay the advance before a month had passed?”\\n\\n“Ah! but that is not possible.”\\n\\n“I do not say, my young friend, that I could do this myself; but I have\\na good friend whose hand reaches a long way. If I had only listened to\\nhis advice when I was younger, you would not have caught me to-day in\\nthe Hotel de Perou. Shall I introduce you to him?”\\n\\n“Am I a perfect fool, to throw away such a chance?”\\n\\n“Good! I shall see him this evening, and will mention your name to him.\\nCall on him at noon to-morrow, and if he takes a fancy to you,--decides\\nto push you, your future is assured, and you will have no doubts as to\\ngetting on.”\\n\\nHe took out a card from his pocket and handed it to Paul, adding, “The\\nname of my friend is Mascarin.”\\n\\nMeanwhile Rose, with a true Parisian’s handiness, had contrived to\\nrestore order from chaos, and had arranged the table, with its one or\\ntwo pieces of broken crockery, with scraps of brown paper instead of\\nplates. A fresh supply of wood crackled bravely on the hearth, and two\\ncandles, one of which was placed in a chipped bottle, and the other in a\\ntarnished candlestick belonging to the porter of the hotel. In the eyes\\nof both the young people the spectacle was a truly delightful one, and\\nPaul’s heart swelled with triumph. The business had been satisfactorily\\nconcluded, and all his misgivings were at an end.\\n\\n“Come, let us gather round the festive board,” said he joyously. “This\\nis breakfast and dinner in one. Rose, be seated; and you, my dear\\nfriend, will surely share with us the repast we owe to you?”\\n\\nWith many protestations of regret, however, Daddy Tantaine pleaded an\\nimportant engagement at the other end of Paris. “And,” added he, “it is\\nabsolutely necessary that I should see Mascarin this evening, for I must\\ntry my best to make him look on you with a favorable eye.”\\n\\nRose was very glad when the old man took his departure, for his\\nugliness, the shabbiness of his dress, and his general aspect of dirt,\\ndrove away all the feelings of gratitude she ought to have evinced, and\\ninspired in her loathing and repugnance; and she fancied that his eyes,\\nthough veiled by his colored glasses, could detect the minutest secrets\\nof her heart; but still this did not prevent her putting on a sweet\\nsmile and entreating him to remain.\\n\\nBut Daddy Tantaine was resolute; and after impressing upon Paul the\\nnecessity of punctuality, he went away, repeating, as he passed through\\nthe door, “May good appetite be present at your little feast, my dears.”\\n\\nAs soon, however, as the door was closed he bent down and listened. The\\nyoung people were as merry as larks, and their laughter filled the\\nbare attic of the Hotel de Perou. Why should not Paul have been in good\\nspirits? He had in his pocket the address of the man who was to make his\\nfortune, and on the chimney-piece was the balance of the banknote, which\\nseemed to him an inexhaustible sum. Rose, too, was delighted, and could\\nnot refrain from jeering at their benefactor, whom she stigmatized as\\n“an old idiot.”\\n\\n“Laugh while you can, my dears!” muttered Daddy Tantaine; “for this may\\nbe the last time you will do so.”\\n\\nWith these words he crept down the dark staircase, which was only\\nlighted up on Sundays, owing to the high price of gas, and, peeping\\nthrough the glass door of the porter’s lodge, saw Madame Loupins engaged\\nin cooking; and, with the timid knock of a man who has learned his\\nlesson in poverty’s grammar, he entered.\\n\\n“Here is my rent, madame,” said he, placing on the table ten francs\\nand twenty centimes. Then, as the woman was scribbling a receipt, he\\nlaunched into a statement of his own affairs, and told her that he had\\ncome into a little property which would enable him to live in comfort\\nduring his few remaining years on earth; and--evidently fearing that\\nhis well-known poverty might cause Madame Loupins to discredit his\\nassertions--drew out his pocketbook and exhibited several banknotes.\\nThis exhibition of wealth so surprised the landlady, that when the old\\nman left she insisted on lighting him to the door. He turned eastward as\\nsoon as he had left the house, and, glancing at the names of the shops,\\nentered a grocer’s establishment at the corner of the Rue de Petit Pont.\\nThis grocer, thanks to a certain cheap wine, manufactured for him by a\\nchemist at Bercy, had achieved a certain notoriety in that quarter. He\\nwas very stout and pompous, a widower, and a sergeant in the National\\nGuard. His name was Melusin. In all poor districts five o’clock is a\\nbusy hour for the shopkeepers, for the workmen are returning from their\\nlabors, and their wives are busy in their preparations for their evening\\nmeal. M. Melusin was so busily engaged, giving orders and seeing that\\nthey were executed, that he did not even notice the entrance of Daddy\\nTantaine; but had he done so, he would not have put himself out for so\\npoorly dressed a customer. But the old man had left behind him in the\\nHotel de Perou every sign of humility and servility, and, making his way\\nto the least crowded portion of the shop, he called out in imperative\\naccents, “M. Melusin!”\\n\\nVery much surprised, the grocer ceased his avocation and hastened to\\nobey the summons. “How the deuce does the man know me?” muttered he,\\nforgetting that his name was over the door in gilt letters fully six\\ninches long.\\n\\n“Sir,” said Daddy Tantaine, without giving the grocer time to speak,\\n“did not a young woman come here about half an hour ago and change a\\nnote for five hundred francs?”\\n\\n“Most certainly,” answered M. Melusin; “but how did you know that? Ah,\\nI have it!” he added, striking his forehead; “there has been a robbery,\\nand you are in pursuit of the criminal. I must confess that the girl\\nlooked so poor, that I guessed there was something wrong. I saw her\\nfingers tremble.”\\n\\n“Pardon me,” returned Daddy Tantaine. “I have said nothing about a\\nrobbery. I only wished to ask you if you would know the girl again?”\\n\\n“Perfectly--a really splendid girl, with hair that you do not see every\\nday. I have reason to believe that she lives in the Rue Hachette. The\\npolice are not very popular with the shopkeeping class; but the latter,\\ndesirous of keeping down crime, generally afford plenty of information,\\nand in the interests of virtue will even risk losing customers, who go\\noff in a huff at not being attended to while they are talking to the\\nofficers of justice. Shall I,” continued the grocer, “send one of the\\nerrand boys to the nearest police station?”\\n\\n“No, thank you,” replied Daddy Tantaine. “I should prefer your keeping\\nthe matter quiet until I communicate with you once more.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I see; a false step just now would put them on their guard.”\\n\\n“Just so. Now, will you let me have the number of the note, if you\\nstill have it? I wish you also to make a note of the date as well as the\\nnumber.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I see,” returned the grocer. “You may require my books as\\ncorroborative evidence; that is often the way. Excuse me; I will be back\\ndirectly.”\\n\\nAll that Daddy Tantaine had desired was executed with the greatest\\nrapidity, and he and the grocer parted on the best terms, and the\\ntradesman watched his visitor’s departure, perfectly satisfied that he\\nhad been assisting a police officer who had deemed it fit to assume a\\ndisguise. Daddy Tantaine cared little what he thought, and, gaining the\\nPlace de Petit Pont, stopped and gazed around as if he was waiting for\\nsome one. Twice he walked round it in vain; but in his third circuit he\\ncame to a halt with an exclamation of satisfaction, for he had seen the\\nperson of whom he had been in search, who was a detestable looking\\nyouth of about eighteen years of age, though so thin and stunted that he\\nhardly appeared to be fifteen.\\n\\nThe lad was leaning against the wall of the Quay St. Michel, openly\\nasking alms, but keeping a sharp lookout for the police. At the first\\nglance it was easy to detect in him the hideous outgrowth of the great\\ncity, the regular young rough of Paris, who, at eight years of age,\\nsmokes the butt ends of cigars picked up at the tavern doors and\\ngets tipsy on coarse spirits. He had a thin crop of sandy hair, his\\ncomplexion was dull and colorless, and a sneer curled the corners of\\nhis mouth, which had a thick, hanging underlip, and his eyes had an\\nexpression in them of revolting cynicism. His dress was tattered and\\ndirty, and he had rolled up the sleeve of his right arm, exhibiting a\\ndeformed limb, sufficiently repulsive to excite the pity of the passers\\nby. He was repeating a monotonous whine, in which the words “poor\\nworkman, arm destroyed by machinery, aged mother to support,” occurred\\ncontinually.\\n\\nDaddy Tantaine walked straight up to the youth, and with a sound cuff\\nsent his hat flying.\\n\\nThe lad turned sharply round, evidently in a terrible rage; but,\\nrecognizing his assailant, shrank back, and muttered to himself,\\n“Landed!” In an instant he restored his arm to its originally healthy\\ncondition, and, picking up his cap, replaced it on his head, and humbly\\nwaited for fresh orders.\\n\\n“Is this the way you execute your errands?” asked Daddy Tantaine,\\nsnarling.\\n\\n“What errands? I have heard of none!”\\n\\n“Never you mind that. Did not M. Mascarin, on my recommendation, put you\\nin the way of earning your livelihood? and did you not promise to give\\nup begging?”\\n\\n“Beg pardon, guv’nor, I meant to be on the square, but I didn’t like to\\nwaste time while I was a-waiting. I don’t like a-being idle and I have\\ncopped seven browns.”\\n\\n“Toto Chupin,” said the old man, with great severity, “you will\\ncertainly come to a bad end. But come, give your report. What have you\\nseen?”\\n\\nDuring this conversation they were walking slowly along the quay, and\\nhad passed the Hotel Dieu.\\n\\n“Well, guv’nor,” replied the young rogue, “I just saw what you said I\\nshould. At four sharp, a carriage drove into the Place, and pulled\\nup bang opposite the wigmaker’s. Dash me, if it weren’t a swell\\nturnout!--horse, coachman, and all, in real slap-up style. It waited so\\nlong that I thought it had taken root there.”\\n\\n“Come, get on! Was there any one inside?”\\n\\n“I should think there was! I twigged him at once, by the description\\nyou gave me. I never see a cove togged out as he was,--tall hat, light\\nsit-down-upons, and a short coat--wasn’t it cut short! but in really\\nbang-up style. To be certain, I went right up to him, for it was getting\\ndark, and had a good look at him. He had got out of the trap, and was\\nmarching up and down the pavement, with an unlighted cigar stuck in his\\nmouth. I took a match, and said, ‘Have a light, my noble swell?’ and\\nhanged if he didn’t give me ten centimes! My! ain’t he ugly!--short,\\nshrivelled up, and knock-kneed, with a glass in his eye, and altogether\\nprecious like a monkey.”\\n\\nDaddy Tantaine began to grow impatient with all this rigmarole. “Come,\\ntell me what took place,” said he angrily.\\n\\n“Precious little. The young swell didn’t seem to care about dirtying his\\ntrotter-cases; he kept slashing about with his cane, and staring at\\nall the gals. What an ass that masher is! Wouldn’t I have liked to have\\npunched his head! If you ever want to hide him, daddy, please think of\\nyours truly. He wouldn’t stand up to me for five minutes.”\\n\\n“Go on, my lad; go on.”\\n\\n“Well, we had waited half an hour, when all at once a woman came sharp\\nround the corner, and stops before the masher. Wasn’t she a fine gal!\\nand hadn’t she a pair of sparklers! but she had awfully seedy togs on.\\nBut they spoke in whispers.”\\n\\n“So you did not hear what they said?”\\n\\n“Do you take me for a flat? The gal said, ‘Do you\\nunderstand?--to-morrow.’ Then the swell chap, says he, ‘Do you promise?’\\nand the gal, she answers back, ‘Yes, at noon.’ Then they parted. She\\nwent off to the Rue Hachette, and the masher tumbled into his wheelbox.\\nThe jarvey cracked his whip, and off they went in a brace of shakes. Now\\nhand over them five francs.”\\n\\nDaddy Tantaine did not seem surprised at this request, and he gave over\\nthe money to the young loafer, with the words, “When I promise, I pay\\ndown on the nail; but remember Toto Chupin, you’ll come to grief one\\nday. Good-night. Our ways lie in different directions.”\\n\\nThe old man, however, lingered until he had seen the lad go off toward\\nthe Jardin des Plantes, and then, turning round, went back by the way\\nhe had come. “I have not lost my day,” murmured he. “All the\\nimprobabilities have turned out certainties, and matters are going\\nstraight. Won’t Flavia be awfully pleased?”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nA REGISTRY OFFICE.\\n\\nThe establishment of the influential friend of Daddy Tantaine was\\nsituated in the Rue Montorgeuil, not far from the Passage de la Reine\\nHortense. M. B. Mascarin has a registry office for the engagement of\\nboth male and female servants. Two boards fastened upon each side of the\\ndoor announce the hours of opening and closing, and give a list of those\\nwhose names are on the books; they further inform the public that the\\nestablishment was founded in 1844, and is still in the same hands. It\\nwas the long existence of M. Mascarin in a business which is usually\\nvery short-lived that had obtained for him a great amount of confidence,\\nnot only in the quarter in which he resided, but throughout the whole\\nof Paris. Employers say that he sends them the best of servants, and\\nthe domestics in their turn assert that he only despatches them to good\\nplaces. But M. Mascarin has still further claims on the public esteem;\\nfor it was he who, in 1845, founded and carried out a project which had\\nfor its aim and end the securing of a shelter for servants out of place.\\nThe better to carry out this, Mascarin took a partner, and gave him\\nthe charge of a furnished house close to the office. Worthy as these\\nprojects were, Mascarin contrived to draw considerable profit from them,\\nand was the owner of the house before which, in the noon of the day\\nfollowing the events we have described, Paul Violaine might have been\\nseen standing. The five hundred francs of old Tantaine, or at any rate a\\nportion of them, had been well spent, and his clothes did credit to his\\nown taste and the skill of his tailor. Indeed, in his fine feathers he\\nlooked so handsome, that many women turned to gaze after him. He however\\ntook but little notice of this, for he was too full of anxiety, having\\ngrave doubts as to the power of the man whom Tantaine had asserted\\ncould, if he liked, make his fortune. “A registry office!” muttered he\\nscornfully. “Is he going to propose a berth of a hundred francs a month\\nto me?” He was much agitated at the thoughts of the impending interview,\\nand, before entering the house, gazed upon its exterior with great\\ninterest. The house much resembled its neighbors. The entrances to the\\nRegistry Office and the Servants’ Home were in the courtyard, at the\\narched entrance to which stood a vendor of roast chestnuts.\\n\\n“There is no use in remaining here,” said Paul. Summoning, therefore,\\nall his resolution, he crossed the courtyard, and, ascending a flight of\\nstairs, paused before a door upon which “OFFICE” was written. “Come in!”\\n responded at once to his knock. He pushed open the door, and entered\\na room, which closely resembled all other similar offices. There were\\nseats all round the room, polished by frequent use. At the end was a\\nsort of compartment shut in by a green baize curtain, jestingly termed\\n“the Confessional” by the frequenters of the office. Between the windows\\nwas a tin plate, with the words, “All fees to be paid in advance,” in\\nlarge letters upon it. In one corner a gentleman was seated at a writing\\ntable, who, as he made entries in a ledger, was talking to a woman who\\nstood beside him.\\n\\n“M. Mascarin?” asked Paul hesitatingly.\\n\\n“What do you want with him?” asked the man, without looking up from his\\nwork. “Do you wish to enter your name? We have now vacancies for three\\nbookkeepers, a cashier, a confidential clerk--six other good situations.\\nCan you give good references?”\\n\\nThese words seemed to be uttered by rote.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” returned Paul; “but I should like to see M.\\nMascarin. One of his friends sent me here.”\\n\\nThis statement evidently impressed the official, and he replied almost\\npolitely, “M. Mascarin is much occupied at present, sir; but he will\\nsoon be disengaged. Pray be seated.”\\n\\nPaul sat down on a bench, and examined the man who had just spoken\\nwith some curiosity. M. Mascarin’s partner was a tall and athletic man,\\nevidently enjoying the best of health, and wearing a large moustache\\nelaborately waxed and pointed. His whole appearance betokened the old\\nsoldier. He had, so he asserted, served in the cavalry, and it was\\nthere that he had acquired the _soubriquet_ by which he was\\nknown--Beaumarchef, his original name being David. He was about\\nforty-five, but was still considered a very good-looking fellow. The\\nentries that he was making in the ledger did not prevent him from\\nkeeping up a conversation with the woman standing by him. The woman,\\nwho seemed to be a cross between a cook and a market-woman, might be\\ndescribed as a thoroughly jovial soul. She seasoned her conversation\\nwith pinches of snuff, and spoke with a strong Alsatian brogue.\\n\\n“Now, look here,” said Beaumarchef; “do you really mean to say that you\\nwant a place?”\\n\\n“I do that.”\\n\\n“You said that six months ago. We got you a splendid one, and three days\\nafterward you chucked up the whole concern.”\\n\\n“And why shouldn’t I? There was no need to work then; but now it is\\nanother pair of shoes, for I have spent nearly all I had saved.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef laid down his pen, and eyed her curiously for a second or\\ntwo; then he said,--\\n\\n“You’ve been making a fool of yourself somehow, I expect.”\\n\\nShe half turned away her head, and began to complain of the hardness\\nof the terms and of the meanness of the mistresses, who, instead of\\nallowing their cooks to do the marketing, did it themselves, and so\\ncheated their servants out of their commissions.\\n\\nBeaumarchef nodded, just as he had done half an hour before to a lady\\nwho had complained bitterly of the misconduct of her servants. He was\\ncompelled by his position to sympathize with both sides.\\n\\nThe woman had now finished her tirade, and drawing the amount of the fee\\nfrom a well-filled purse, placed it on the table, saying,--\\n\\n“Please, M. Beaumarchef, register my name as Caroline Scheumal, and get\\nme a real good place. It must be a cook, you understand, and I want to\\ndo the marketing without the missus dodging around.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll do my best.”\\n\\n“Try and find me a wealthy widower, or a young woman married to a very\\nold fellow. Now, do look round; I’ll drop in again to-morrow;” and with\\na farewell pinch of snuff, she left the office.\\n\\nPaul listened to this conversation with feelings of anger and\\nhumiliation, and in his heart cursed old Tantaine for having introduced\\nhim into such company. He was seeking for some plausible excuse for\\nwithdrawal, when the door at the end of the room was thrown open, and\\ntwo men came in, talking as they did so. The one was young and well\\ndressed, with an easy, swaggering manner, which ignorant people mistake\\nfor good breeding. He had a many-colored rosette at his buttonhole,\\nshowing that he was the knight of more than one foreign order. The other\\nwas an elderly man, with an unmistakable legal air about him. He was\\ndressed in a quilted dressing-gown, fur-lined shoes, and had on his head\\nan embroidered cap, most likely the work of the hands of some one dear\\nto him. He wore a white cravat, and his sight compelled him to use\\ncolored glasses.\\n\\n“Then, my dear sir,” said the younger man, “I may venture to entertain\\nhopes?”\\n\\n“Remember, Marquis,” returned the other, “that if I were acting alone,\\nwhat you require would be at once at your disposal. Unfortunately, I\\nhave others to consult.”\\n\\n“I place myself entirely in your hands,” replied the Marquis.\\n\\nThe appearance of the fashionably dressed young man reconciled Paul to\\nthe place in which he was.\\n\\n“A Marquis!” he murmured; “and the other swell-looking fellow must be M.\\nMascarin.”\\n\\nPaul was about to step forward, when Beaumarchef respectfully accosted\\nthe last comer,--\\n\\n“Who do you think, sir,” said he, “I have just seen?”\\n\\n“Tell me quickly,” was the impatient reply.\\n\\n“Caroline Schimmel; you know who I mean.”\\n\\n“What! the woman who was in the service of the Duchess of Champdoce?”\\n\\n“Exactly so.”\\n\\nM. Mascarin uttered an exclamation of delight.\\n\\n“Where is she living now?”\\n\\nBeaumarchef was utterly overwhelmed by this simple question. For the\\nfirst time in his life he had omitted to take a client’s address. This\\nomission made Mascarin so angry that he forgot all his good manners, and\\nbroke out with an oath that would have shamed a London cabman,--\\n\\n“How could you be such an infernal fool? We have been hunting for this\\nwoman for five months. You knew this as well as I did, and yet, when\\nchance brings her to you, you let her slip through your fingers and\\nvanish again.”\\n\\n“She’ll be back again, sir; never fear. She won’t fling away the money\\nthat she had paid for fees.”\\n\\n“And what do you think that she cares for ten sous or ten francs? She’ll\\nbe back when she thinks she will; but a woman who drinks and is off her\\nhead nearly all the year round----”\\n\\nInspired by a sudden thought, Beaumarchef made a clutch at his hat.\\n\\n“She has only just gone,” said he; “I can easily overtake her.”\\n\\nBut Mascarin arrested his progress.\\n\\n“You are not a good bloodhound. Take Toto Chupin with you; he is outside\\nwith his chestnuts, and is as fly as they make them. If you catch her\\nup, don’t say a word, but follow her up, and see where she goes. I want\\nto know her whole daily life. Remember that no item, however unimportant\\nit may seem, is not of consequence.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef disappeared in an instant, and Mascarin continued to\\ngrumble.\\n\\n“What a fool!” he murmured. “If I could only do everything myself. I\\nworried my life out for months, trying to find the clue to the mystery\\nwhich this woman holds, and now she has again escaped me.”\\n\\nPaul, who saw that his presence was not remarked, coughed to draw\\nattention to it. In an instant Mascarin turned quickly round.\\n\\n“Excuse me,” said Paul; but the set smile had already resumed its place\\nupon Mascarin’s countenance.\\n\\n“You are,” remarked he, civilly, “Paul Violaine, are you not?”\\n\\nThe young man bowed in assent.\\n\\n“Forgive my absence for an instant. I will be back directly,” said\\nMascarin.\\n\\nHe passed through the door, and in another instant Paul heard his name\\ncalled.\\n\\nCompared to the outer chamber, Mascarin’s office was quite a luxurious\\napartment, for the windows were bright, the paper on the walls fresh,\\nand the floor carpeted. But few of the visitors to the office could\\nboast of having been admitted into this sanctum; for generally business\\nwas conducted at Beaumarchef’s table in the outer room. Paul, however,\\nwho was unacquainted with the prevailing rule, was not aware of the\\ndistinction with which he had been received. Mascarin, on his visitor’s\\nentrance, was comfortably seated in an armchair before the fire, with\\nhis elbow on his desk--and what a spectacle did that desk present! It\\nwas a perfect world in itself, and indicated that its proprietor was a\\nman of many trades. It was piled with books and documents, while a great\\ndeal of the space was occupied by square pieces of cardboard, upon each\\nof which was a name in large letters, while underneath was writing in\\nvery minute characters.\\n\\nWith a benevolent gesture, Mascarin pointed to an armchair, and in\\nencouraging tones said, “And now let us talk.”\\n\\nIt was plain to Paul that Mascarin was not acting, but that the kind and\\npatriarchal expression upon his face was natural to it, and the young\\nman felt that he could safely intrust his whole future to him.\\n\\n“I have heard,” commenced Mascarin, “that your means of livelihood are\\nvery precarious, or rather that you have none, and are ready to take\\nthe first one that offers you a means of subsistence. That, at least, is\\nwhat I hear from my poor friend Tantaine.”\\n\\n“He has explained my case exactly.”\\n\\n“Good; only before proceeding to the future, let us speak of the past.”\\n\\nPaul gave a start, which Mascarin noticed, for he added,--\\n\\n“You will excuse the freedom I am taking; but it is absolutely necessary\\nthat I should know to what I am binding myself. Tantaine tells me that\\nyou are a charming young man, strictly honest, and well educated; and\\nnow that I have had the pleasure of meeting you, I am sure that he is\\nright; but I can only deal with proofs, and must be quite certain before\\nI act on your behalf with third parties.”\\n\\n“I have nothing to conceal, sir, and am ready to answer any questions,”\\n responded Paul.\\n\\nA slight smile, which Paul did not detect, played round the corners of\\nMascarin’s mouth, and, with a gesture, with which all who knew him were\\nfamiliar, he pushed back his glasses on his nose.\\n\\n“I thank you,” answered he; “it is not so easy as you may suppose to\\nhide anything from me.” He took one of the packets of pasteboard slips\\nform his desk, and shuffling them like a pack of cards, continued, “Your\\nname is Marie Paul Violaine. You were born at Poitiers, in the Rue\\ndes Vignes, on the 5th of January, 1843, and are therefore in your\\ntwenty-fourth year.”\\n\\n“That is quite correct, sir.”\\n\\n“You are an illegitimate child?”\\n\\nThe first question had surprised Paul; the second absolutely astounded\\nhim.\\n\\n“Quite true, sir,” replied he, not attempting to hide his surprise; “but\\nI had no idea that M. Tantaine was so well informed; the partition which\\ndivided our rooms must have been thinner than I thought.”\\n\\nMascarin took no notice of this remark, but continued to shuffle and\\nexamine his pieces of cardboard. Had Paul caught a clear glimpse of\\nthese, he would have seen his initials in the corner of each.\\n\\n“Your mother,” went on Mascarin, “kept, for the last fifteen years of\\nher life, a little haberdasher’s shop.”\\n\\n“Just so.”\\n\\n“But a business of that description in a town like Poitiers, does not\\nbring in very remunerative results, and luckily she received for your\\nsupport and education a sum of one thousand francs per year.”\\n\\nThis time Paul started from his seat, for he was sure that Tantaine\\ncould not have learned this secret at the Hotel de Perou.\\n\\n“Merciful powers, sir!” cried he; “who could have told you a thing that\\nhas never passed my lips since my arrival in Paris, and of which even\\nRose is entirely ignorant?”\\n\\nMascarin raised his shoulders.\\n\\n“You can easily comprehend,” remarked he, “that a man in my line of\\nbusiness has to learn many things. If I did not take the greatest\\nprecautions, I should be deceived daily, and so lead others into error.”\\n\\nPaul had not been more than an hour in the office, but the directions\\ngiven to Beaumarchef had already taught him how many of these events\\nwere arranged.\\n\\n“Though I may be curious,” went on Mascarin, “I am the symbol of\\ndiscretion; so answer me frankly: How did your mother receive this\\nannuity?”\\n\\n“Through a Parisian solicitor.”\\n\\n“Do you know him?”\\n\\n“Not at all,” answered Paul, who had begun to grow uneasy under this\\nquestioning, for a kind of vague apprehension was aroused in his mind,\\nand he could not see the utility of any of these interrogations. There\\nwas, however, nothing in Mascarin’s manner to justify the misgivings\\nof the young man, for he appeared to ask all these questions in quite a\\nmatter-of-course way, as if they were purely affairs of business.\\n\\nAfter a protracted silence, Mascarin resumed,--\\n\\n“I am half inclined to believe that the solicitor sent the money on his\\nown account.”\\n\\n“No, sir,” answered Paul. “I am sure you are mistaken.”\\n\\n“Why are you so certain?”\\n\\n“Because my mother, who was the incarnation of truth, often assured me\\nthat my father died before my birth. Poor mother! I loved and respected\\nher too much to question her on these matters. One day, however,\\nimpelled by an unworthy feeling of curiosity, I dared to ask her the\\nname of our protector. She burst into tears, and then I felt how mean\\nand cruel I had been. I never learned his name but I know that he was\\nnot my father.”\\n\\nMascarin affected not to notice the emotion of his young client.\\n\\n“Did the allowance cease at your mother’s death?” continued he.\\n\\n“No; it was stopped when I came of age. My mother told me that this\\nwould be the case; but it seems only yesterday that she spoke to me of\\nit. It was on my birthday, and she had prepared a little treat for my\\nsupper; for in spite of the affliction my birth had caused her, she\\nloved me fondly. Poor mother! ‘Paul,’ said she, ‘at your birth a genuine\\nfriend promised to help me to bring up and educate you, and he kept his\\nword. But you are now twenty-one, and must expect nothing more from him.\\nMy son, you are a man now, and I have only you to look to. Work and earn\\nan honest livelihood----’”\\n\\nPaul could proceed no farther, for his emotions choked him.\\n\\n“My mother died suddenly some ten months after this\\nconversation--without time to communicate anything to me, and I was left\\nperfectly alone in the world; and were I to die to-morrow, there would\\nnot be a soul to follow me to my grave.”\\n\\nMascarin put on a sympathetic look.\\n\\n“Not quite so bad as that, my young friend; I trust that you have one\\nnow.”\\n\\nMascarin rose from his seat, and for a few minutes paced up and down the\\nroom, and then halted, with his arms folded, before the young man.\\n\\n“You have heard me,” said he, “and I will not put any further questions\\nwhich it will but pain you to reply to, for I only wished to take your\\nmeasure, and to judge of your truth from your replies. You will ask why?\\nAh, that is a question I cannot answer to-day, but you shall know later\\non. Be assured, however, that I know everything about you, but I cannot\\ntell you by what means. Say it has all happened by chance. Chance has\\nbroad shoulders, and can bear a great deal.”\\n\\nThis ambiguous speech caused a thrill of terror to pass through Paul,\\nwhich was plainly visible on his expressive features.\\n\\n“Are you alarmed?” asked Mascarin, readjusting his spectacles.\\n\\n“I am much surprised, sir,” stammered Paul.\\n\\n“Come, come! what can a man in your circumstances have to fear? There\\nis no use racking your brain; you will find out all you want quickly\\nenough, and had best make up your mind to place yourself in my hands\\nwithout reserve, for my sole desire is to be of service to you.”\\n\\nThese words were uttered in the most benevolent manner; and as he\\nresumed his seat, he added,--\\n\\n“Now let us talk of myself. Your mother, whom you justly say was a\\nthoroughly good woman, pinched herself in order to keep you at college\\nat Poitiers. You entered a solicitor’s office at eighteen, I think?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“But your mother’s desire was to see you established at Loudon or\\nCevray. Perhaps she hoped that her wealthy friend would aid you still\\nfurther. Unluckily, however, you had no inclination for the law.”\\n\\nPaul smiled, but Mascarin went on with some little severity.\\n\\n“I repeat, unfortunately; and I think that by this time you have gone\\nthrough enough to be of my opinion. What did you do instead of studying\\nlaw? You did--what? You wasted your time over music, and composed songs,\\nand, I know, an opera, and thought yourself a perfect genius.”\\n\\nPaul had listened up to this time with patience, but at this sarcasm\\nhe endeavored to protest; but it was in vain, for Mascarin went on\\npitilessly,--\\n\\n“One day you abandoned the study of the law, and told your mother\\nthat until you had made your name as a musical composer you would give\\nlessons on the piano; but you could obtain no pupils, and--well, just\\nlook in the glass yourself, and say if you think that your age and\\nappearance would justify parents in intrusting their daughters to your\\ntuition?”\\n\\nMascarin stopped for a moment and consulted his notes afresh.\\n\\n“Your departure from Poitiers,” he went on, “was your last act of folly.\\nThe very day after your poor mother’s death you collected together all\\nher scanty savings, and took the train to Paris.”\\n\\n“Then, sir, I had hoped----”\\n\\n“What, to arrive at fortune by the road of talent? Foolish boy! Every\\nyear a thousand poor wretches have been thus intoxicated by their\\nprovincial celebrity, and have started for Paris, buoyed up by similar\\nhopes. Do you know the end of them? At the end of ten years--I give them\\nno longer--nine out of ten die of starvation and disappointment, and the\\nother joins the criminal army.”\\n\\nPaul had often repeated this to himself, and could, therefore, make no\\nreply.\\n\\n“But,” went on Mascarin, “you did not leave Poitiers alone; you carried\\noff with you a young girl named Rose Pigoreau.”\\n\\n“Pray, let me explain.”\\n\\n“It would be useless. The fact speaks for itself. In six months your\\nlittle store had disappeared; then came poverty and starvation, and at\\nlast, in the Hotel de Perou, your thoughts turned to suicide, and you\\nwere only saved by my old friend Tantaine.”\\n\\nPaul felt his temper rising, for these plain truths were hard to bear;\\nbut fear lest he should lose his protector kept him silent.\\n\\n“I admit everything, sir,” said he calmly. “I was a fool, and almost\\nmad, but experience has taught me a bitter lesson. I am here to-day,\\nand this fact should tell you that I have given up all my vain\\nhallucinations.”\\n\\n“Will you give up Rose Pigoreau?”\\n\\nAs this abrupt question was put to him, Paul turned pale with anger.\\n\\n“I love Rose,” answered he coldly; “she believes in me, and has shared\\nmy troubles with courage, and one day she shall be my wife.”\\n\\nRaising his velvet cap from his head, Mascarin bowed with an ironical\\nair, saying, “Is that so? Then I beg a thousand pardons. It is urgent\\nthat you should have immediate employment. Pray, what can you do? Not\\nmuch of anything, I fancy;--like most college bred boys, you can do a\\nlittle of everything, and nothing well. Had I a son, and an enormous\\nincome, I would have him taught a trade.”\\n\\nPaul bit his lip; but he knew the portrait was a true one.\\n\\n“And now,” continued Mascarin, “I have come to your aid, and what do you\\nsay to a situation with a salary of twelve thousand francs?”\\n\\nThis sum was so much greater than Paul had dared to hope, that he\\nbelieved Mascarin was amusing himself at his expense.\\n\\n“It is not kind of you to laugh at me, under the present circumstances,”\\n remarked he.\\n\\nMascarin was not laughing at him; but it was fully half an hour before\\nhe could prove this to Paul.\\n\\n“You would like more proof of what I say,” said he, after a long\\nconversation. “Very well, then; shall I advance your first month’s\\nsalary?” And as he spoke, he took a thousand-franc note from his desk,\\nand offered it to Paul. The young man rejected the note; but the force\\nof the argument struck him; and he asked if he was capable of carrying\\nout the duties which such a salary doubtless demanded.\\n\\n“Were I not certain of your abilities, I should not offer it to you,”\\n replied Mascarin. “I am in a hurry now, or I would explain the whole\\naffair; but I must defer doing so until to-morrow, when please come at\\nthe same hour as you did to-day.”\\n\\nEven in his state of surprise and stupefaction, Paul felt that this was\\na signal for him to depart.\\n\\n“A moment more,” said Mascarin. “You understand that you can no longer\\nremain at the Hotel de Perou? Try and find a room in this neighborhood;\\nand when you have done so, leave the address at the office. Good-bye, my\\nyoung friend, until to-morrow, and learn to bear good fortune.”\\n\\nFor a few minutes Mascarin stood at the door of the office watching\\nPaul, who departed almost staggering beneath the burden of so many\\nconflicting emotions; and when he saw him disappear round the corner, he\\nran to a glazed door which led to his bed chamber, and in a loud whisper\\ncalled, “Come in, Hortebise. He has gone.”\\n\\nA man obeyed the summons at once, and hurriedly drew up a chair to the\\nfire. “My feet are almost frozen,” exclaimed he; “I should not know\\nit if any one was to chop them off. Your room, my dear Baptiste, is a\\nperfect refrigerator. Another time, please, have a fire lighted in it.”\\n\\nThis speech, however, did not disturb Mascarin’s line of thought. “Did\\nyou hear all?” asked he.\\n\\n“I saw and heard all that you did.”\\n\\n“And what do you think of the lad?”\\n\\n“I think that Daddy Tantaine is a man of observation and powerful will,\\nand that he will mould this child between his fingers like wax.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nTHE OPINION OF DR. HORTEBISE.\\n\\nDr. Hortebise, who had addressed Mascarin so familiarly by his Christian\\nname of Baptiste, was about fifty-six years of age, but he carried his\\nyears so well, that he always passed for forty-nine. He had a heavy pair\\nof red, sensual-looking lips, his hair was untinted by gray, and his\\neyes still lustrous. A man who moved in the best society, eloquent in\\nmanner, a brilliant conversationalist, and vivid in his perceptions, he\\nconcealed under the veil of good-humored sarcasm the utmost cynicism of\\nmind. He was very popular and much sought after. He had but few faults,\\nbut quite a catalogue of appalling vices. Under this Epicurean exterior\\nlurked, it was reported, the man of talent and the celebrated physician.\\nHe was not a hard-working man, simply because he achieved the same\\nresults without toil or labor. He had recently taken to homoeopathy, and\\nstarted a medical journal, which he named _The Globule_, which died at\\nits fifth number. His conversation made all society laugh, and he joined\\nin the ridicule, thus showing the sincerity of his views, for he\\nwas never able to take the round of life seriously. To-day, however,\\nMascarin, well as he knew his friend, seemed piqued at his air of\\nlevity.\\n\\n“When I asked you to come here to-day,” said he, “and when I begged you\\nto conceal yourself in my bedroom--”\\n\\n“Where I was half frozen,” broke in Hortebise.\\n\\n“It was,” went on Mascarin, “because I desired your advice. We have\\nstarted on a serious undertaking,--an undertaking full of peril both to\\nyou and to myself.”\\n\\n“Pooh! I have perfect confidence in you,--whatever you do is done well,\\nand you are not the man to fling away your trump cards.”\\n\\n“True; but I may lose the game, after all, and then----”\\n\\nThe doctor merely shook a large gold locket that depended from his watch\\nchain.\\n\\nThis movement seemed to annoy Mascarin a great deal. “Why do you flash\\nthat trinket at me?” asked he. “We have known each other for five and\\ntwenty years,--what do you mean to imply? Do you mean that the locket\\ncontains the likeness of some one that you intend to make use of later\\non? I think that you might render such a step unnecessary by giving me\\nyour present advice and attention.”\\n\\nHortebise threw himself back in his chair with an expression of\\nresignation. “If you want advice,” remarked he, “why not apply to our\\nworthy friend Catenac?--he knows something of business, as he is a\\nlawyer.”\\n\\nThe name of Catenac seemed to irritate Mascarin so much, that calm, and\\nself-contained as he usually was, he pulled off his cap and dashed it on\\nhis desk.\\n\\n“Are you speaking seriously?” said he angrily.\\n\\n“Why should I not be in earnest?”\\n\\nMascarin removed his glasses, as though without them he could the more\\neasily peer into the depths of the soul of the man before him.\\n\\n“Because,” replied he slowly, “both you and I distrust Catenac. When did\\nyou see him last?”\\n\\n“More than three months ago.”\\n\\n“True, and I allow that he seems to be acting fairly toward his old\\nassociates; but you will admit that, in keeping away thus, his conduct\\nis without excuse, for he has made his fortune; and though he pretends\\nto be poor, he is certainly a man of wealth.”\\n\\n“Do you really think so?”\\n\\n“Were he here, I would force him to acknowledge that he is worth a\\nmillion, at least.”\\n\\n“A million!” exclaimed the doctor, with sudden animation.\\n\\n“Yes, certainly. You and I, Hortebise, have indulged our every whim, and\\nhave spent gold like water, while our friend garnered his harvest and\\nstored it away. But poor Catenac has no expensive tastes, nor does he\\ncare for women or the pleasures of the table. While we indulged in every\\npleasure, he lent out his money at usurious interest. But, stop,--how\\nmuch do you spend per annum?”\\n\\n“That is a hard question to answer; but, say, forty thousand francs.”\\n\\n“More, a great deal more; but calculate what a capital sum that would\\namount to during the twenty years we have done business together.”\\n\\nThe doctor was not clever at figures; he made several vain attempts to\\nsolve the problem, and at last gave it up in despair. “Forty and forty,”\\n muttered he, tapping the tips of his fingers, “are eighty, then forty--”\\n\\n“Call it eight hundred thousand francs,” broke in Mascarin. “Say I drew\\nthe same amount as you did. We have spent ours, and Catenac has saved\\nhis, and grown rich; hence my distrust. Our interests are no longer\\nidentical. He certainly comes here every month, but it is only to claim\\nhis share; he consents to take his share of the profits, but shirks the\\nrisks. It is fully ten years since he brought in any business. I don’t\\ntrust him at all. He always declines to join in any scheme that we\\npropose, and sees danger in everything.”\\n\\n“He would not betray us, however.”\\n\\nMascarin took a few moments for reflection. “I think,” said he, “that\\nCatenac is afraid of us. He knows that the ruin of me would entail the\\ndestruction of the other two. This is our only safeguard; but if he\\ndare not injure us openly, he is quite capable of working against us in\\nsecret. Do you remember what he said the last time he was here? That we\\nought to close our business and retire. How should _we_ live? for he is\\nrich and we are poor. What on earth are you doing, Hortebise?” he added,\\nfor the physician, who had the reputation of being worth an enormous\\namount, had taken out his purse, and was going over the contents.\\n\\n“I have scarcely three hundred and twenty-seven francs!” answered he\\nwith a laugh. “What is the state of your finances?”\\n\\nMascarin made a grimace. “I am not so well off as you; and besides,” he\\ncontinued in a low voice, as though speaking to himself, “I have certain\\nties which you do not possess.”\\n\\nFor the first time during this interview a cloud spread over the\\ndoctor’s countenance.\\n\\n“Great Heavens!” said he, “and I was depending on you for three thousand\\nfrancs, which I require urgently.”\\n\\nMascarin smiled slyly at the doctor’s uneasiness. “Don’t worry,” he\\nanswered. “You can have that; there ought to be some six or eight\\nthousand francs in the safe. But that is all, and that is the last\\nof our common capital,--this after twenty years of toil, danger, and\\nanxiety, and we have not twenty years before us to make a fresh fortune\\nin.”\\n\\n“Yes,” continued Mascarin, “we are getting old, and therefore have the\\ngreater reason for making one grand stroke to assure our fortune. Were I\\nto fall ill to-morrow, all would go to smash.”\\n\\n“Quite true,” returned the doctor, with a slight shudder.\\n\\n“We must, and that is certain, venture on a bold stroke. I have said\\nthis for years, and woven a web of gigantic proportions. Do you now\\nknow why at this last moment I appeal to you, and not to Catenac\\nfor assistance? If only one out of two operations that I have fully\\nexplained to you succeeds, our fortune is made.”\\n\\n“I follow you exactly.”\\n\\n“The question now is whether the chance of success is sufficiently great\\nto warrant our going on with these undertakings. Think it over and let\\nme have your opinion.”\\n\\nAn acute observer could easily have seen that the doctor was a man of\\nresource, and a thoroughly competent adviser, for the reason that his\\ncoolness never deserted him. Compelled to choose between the use of the\\ncontents of his locket, or the continuance of a life of luxurious ease,\\nthe smile vanished from the doctor’s face, and he began to reflect\\nprofoundly. Leaning back in his chair, with his feet resting on the\\nfender, he carefully studied every combination in the undertaking, as\\na general inspects the position taken up by the enemy, when a battle\\nis impending, upon which the fate of an empire may hinge. That this\\nanalysis took a favorable turn, was evident, for Mascarin soon saw a\\nsmile appear upon the doctor’s lips. “We must make the attack at\\nonce,” said he; “but make no mistake; the projects you propose are most\\ndangerous, and a single error upon our side would entail destruction;\\nbut we must take some risk. The odds are against us, but still we may\\nwin. Under these circumstances, and as necessity cheers us on, I say,\\n_Forward!_” As he said this, he rose to his feet, and extending his hand\\ntoward his friend, exclaimed, “I am entirely at your disposal.”\\n\\nMascarin seemed relieved by the doctor’s decision, for he was in\\nthat frame of mind when, however self-reliant a man may be, he has a\\ndisinclination to be left alone, and the aid of a stout ally is of the\\nutmost service.\\n\\n“Have you considered every point carefully?” asked he. “You know that\\nwe can only act at present upon one of the undertakings, and that is the\\none of which the Marquis de Croisenois----”\\n\\n“I know that.”\\n\\n“With reference to the affair of the Duke de Champdoce, I have still to\\ngather together certain things necessary for the ultimate success of\\nthe scheme. There is a mystery in the lives of the Duke and Duchess,--of\\nthis there is no doubt,--but what is this secret? I would lay my life\\nthat I have hit upon the correct solution; but I want no suspicions,\\nno probabilities; I want absolute certainties. And now,” continued he,\\n“this brings us back to the first question. What do you think of Paul\\nViolaine?”\\n\\nHortebise walked up and down the room two or three times, and finally\\nstopped opposite to his friend. “I think,” said he, “that the lad has\\nmany of the qualities we want, and we might find it hard to discover one\\nbetter suited for our purpose. Besides, he is a bastard, knows nothing\\nof his father, and therefore leaves a wide field for conjecture; for\\nevery natural son has the right to consider himself, if he likes, the\\noffspring of a monarch. He has no family or any one to look after him,\\nwhich assures us that whatever may happen, there is no one to call us to\\naccount. He is not overwise, but has a certain amount of talent, and any\\nquantity of ridiculous self-conceit. He is wonderfully handsome, which\\nwill make matters easier, but--”\\n\\n“Ah, there is a ‘but’ then?”\\n\\n“More than one,” answered the doctor, “for there are three for certain.\\nFirst, there is Rose Pigoreau, whose beauty has so captivated our old\\nfriend Tantaine,--she certainly appears to be a danger in the future.”\\n\\n“Be easy,” returned Mascarin; “we will quickly remove this young woman\\nfrom our road.”\\n\\n“Good; but do not be too confident,” answered Hortebise, in his usual\\ntone. “The danger from her is not the one you think, and which you are\\ntrying to avoid. You think Paul loves her. You are wrong. He would drop\\nher to-morrow, so that he could please his self-indulgence. But the\\nwoman who thinks that she hates her lover often deceives herself; and\\nRose is simply tired of poverty. Give her a little amount of comfort,\\ngood living, and luxury, and you will see her give them all up to come\\nback to Paul. Yes, I tell you, she will harass and annoy him, as women\\nof her class who have nothing to love always do. She will even go to\\nFlavia to claim him.”\\n\\n“She had better not,” retorted Mascarin, in threatening accents.\\n\\n“Why, how could you prevent it? She has known Paul from his infancy. She\\nknew his mother; she was perhaps brought up by her, perhaps even lived\\nin the same street. Look out, I say, for danger from that quarter.”\\n\\n“You may be right, and I will take my precautions.”\\n\\nIt was sufficient for Mascarin to be assured of a danger to find means\\nof warding it off.\\n\\n“My second ‘but,’” continued Hortebise, “is the idea of the mysterious\\nprotector of whom the young man spoke. His mother, he says, has reason\\nto know that his father is dead, and I believe in the truth of the\\nstatement. In this case, what has become of the person who paid Madame\\nViolaine her allowance?”\\n\\n“You are right, quite right; these are the crevices in our armor; but I\\nkeep my eyes open, and nothing escapes me.”\\n\\nThe doctor was growing rather weary, but he still went on courageously.\\n“My third ‘but’” said he, “is perhaps the strongest. We must see the\\nyoung fellow at once. It may be to-morrow, without even having prepared\\nhim or taught him his part. Suppose we found that he was honest!\\nImagine--if he returned a firm negative to all your dazzling offers!”\\n\\nMascarin rose to his feet in his turn. “I do not think that there is any\\nchance of that,” said he.\\n\\n“Why not, pray?”\\n\\n“Because when Tantaine brought him to me, he had studied him carefully.\\nHe is as weak as a woman, and as vain as a journalist. Besides, he is\\nashamed at being poor. No; I can mould him like wax into any shape I\\nlike. He will be just what we wish.”\\n\\n“Are you sure,” asked Hortebise, “that Flavia will have nothing to say\\nin this matter?”\\n\\n“I had rather, with your permission, say nothing on that head,” returned\\nMascarin. He broke off his speech and listened eagerly. “There is some\\none listening,” said he. “Hark!”\\n\\nThe sound was repeated, and the doctor was about to seek refuge in the\\ninner room, when Mascarin laid a detaining hand upon his arm.\\n\\n“Stay,” observed he, “it is only Beaumarchef;” and as he spoke,\\nhe struck a gilded bell that stood on his desk. In another instant\\nBeaumarchef appeared, and with an air in which familiarity was mingled\\nwith respect, he saluted in military fashion.\\n\\n“Ah,” said the doctor pleasantly, “do you take your nips of brandy\\nregularly?”\\n\\n“Only occasionally, sir,” stammered the man.\\n\\n“Too often, too often, my good fellow. Do you think that your nose and\\neyelids are not real telltales?”\\n\\n“But I assure you, sir--”\\n\\n“Do you not remember I told you that you had asthmatic symptoms?\\nWhy, the movement of your pectoral muscles shows that your lungs are\\naffected.”\\n\\n“But I have been running, sir.”\\n\\nMascarin broke in upon this conversation, which he considered frivolous.\\n“If he is out of breath,” remarked he, “it is because he has been\\nendeavoring to repair a great act of carelessness that he has committed.\\nWell, Beaumarchef, how did you get on?”\\n\\n“All right, sir,” returned he, with a look of triumph. “Good!”\\n\\n“What are you talking about?” asked the doctor.\\n\\nMascarin gave his friend a meaning glance, and then, in a careless\\nmanner, replied, “Caroline Schimmel, a former servant of the Champdoce\\nfamily, also patronizes our office. How did you find her, Beaumarchef?”\\n\\n“Well, an idea occurred to me.”\\n\\n“Pooh! do you have ideas at your time of life?”\\n\\nBeaumarchef put on an air of importance. “My idea was this,” he went\\non: “as I left the office with Toto Chupin, I said to myself, the woman\\nwould certainly drop in at some pub before she reached the boulevard.”\\n\\n“A sound argument,” remarked the doctor.\\n\\n“Therefore Toto and I took a squint into every one we passed, and before\\nwe got to the Rue Carreau we saw her in one, sure enough.”\\n\\n“And Toto is after her now?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir; he said he would follow her like her shadow, and will bring\\nin a report every day.”\\n\\n“I am very pleased with you, Beaumarchef,” said Mascarin, rubbing his\\nhands joyously.\\n\\nBeaumarchef seemed highly flattered, but continued,--\\n\\n“This is not all.”\\n\\n“What else is there to tell?”\\n\\n“I met La Candele on his way from the Place de Petit Pont, and he\\nhas just seen that young girl--you know whom I mean--driving off in a\\ntwo-horse Victoria. He followed it, of course. She has been placed in a\\ngorgeous apartment in the Rue Douai; and from what the porter says, she\\nmust be a rare beauty; and La Candele raved about her, and says that she\\nhas the most magnificent eyes in the world.”\\n\\n“Ah,” remarked Hortebise, “then Tantaine was right in his description of\\nher.”\\n\\n“Of course he was,” answered Mascarin with a slight frown, “and this\\nproves the justice of the objection you made a little time back. A girl\\npossessed of such dazzling beauty may even influence the fool who has\\ncarried her off to become dangerous.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef touched his master’s arm kindly. “If you wish to get rid of\\nthe masher,” said he, “I can show you a way;” and throwing himself\\ninto the position of a fencer, he made a lunge with his right arm,\\nexclaiming, “One, two!”\\n\\n“A Prussian quarrel,” remarked Mascarin. “No; a duel would do us no\\ngood. We should still have the girl on our hands, and violent measures\\nare always to be avoided.” He took off his glasses, wiped them, and\\nlooking at the doctor intently, said, “Suppose we take an epidemic as\\nour ally. If the girl had the smallpox, she would lose her beauty.”\\n\\nCynical and hardened as the doctor was, he drew back in horror at this\\nproposal. “Under certain circumstances,” remarked he, “science might aid\\nus; but Rose, even without her beauty, would be just as dangerous as she\\nis now. It is _her_ affection for Paul that we have to check, and not\\n_his_ for her; and the uglier a woman is, the more she clings to her\\nlover.”\\n\\n“All this is worthy of consideration,” returned Mascarin; “meanwhile we\\nmust take steps to guard ourselves from the impending danger. Have you\\nfinished that report on Gandelu, Beaumarchef? What is his position?”\\n\\n“Head over ears in debt, sir, but not harassed by his creditors because\\nof his future prospects.”\\n\\n“Surely among these creditors there are some that we could influence?”\\n said Mascarin. “Find this out, and report to me this evening; and\\nfarewell for the present.”\\n\\nWhen again alone, the two confederates remained silent for some time.\\nThe decisive moment had arrived. As yet they were not compromised; but\\nif they intended to carry out their plans, they must no longer remain\\ninactive; and both of these men had sufficient experience to know that\\nthey must look at the position boldly, and make up their minds at once.\\nThe pleasant smile upon the doctor’s face faded away, and his fingers\\nplayed nervously with his locket. Mascarin was the first to break the\\nsilence.\\n\\n“Let us no longer hesitate,” said he; “let us shut our eyes to the\\ndanger and advance steadily. You heard the promises made by the Marquis\\nde Croisenois. He will do as we wish, but under certain conditions.\\nMademoiselle de Mussidan must be his bride.”\\n\\n“That will be impossible.”\\n\\n“Not so, if we desire it: and the proof of this is, that before two\\no’clock the engagement between Mademoiselle Sabine and the Baron de\\nBreulh-Faverlay will be broken off.”\\n\\nThe doctor heaved a deep sigh. “I can understand Catenac’s scruples. Ah!\\nif, like him, I had a million!”\\n\\nDuring this brief conversation Mascarin had gone into his sleeping room\\nand was busily engaged in changing his dress.\\n\\n“If you are ready,” remarked the doctor, “we will make a start.”\\n\\nIn reply, Mascarin opened the door leading into the office. “Get a cab,\\nBeaumarchef,” said he.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nA TRUSTWORTHY SERVANT.\\n\\nIn the City of Paris it is impossible to find a more fashionable quarter\\nthan the one which is bounded on the one side by the Rue Faubourg Saint\\nHonore and on the other by the Seine, and commences at the Place de la\\nConcorde and ends at the Avenue de l’Imperatrice. In this favored spot\\nmillionaires seem to bloom like the rhododendron in the sunny south.\\nThere are the magnificent palaces which they have erected for their\\naccommodation, where the turf is ever verdant, and where the flowers\\nbloom perennially; but the most gorgeous of all these mansions was the\\nHotel de Mussidan, the last _chef d’oeuvre_ of Sevair, that skilful\\narchitect who died just as the world was beginning to recognize his\\ntalents. With a spacious courtyard in front and a magnificent garden in\\nthe rear, the Hotel de Mussidan is as elegant as it is commodious.\\nThe exterior was extremely plain, and not disfigured by florid\\nornamentation. White marble steps, with a light and elegant railing at\\nthe sides, lead to the wide doors which open into the hall. The busy hum\\nof the servants at work at an early hour in the yard tells that an ample\\nestablishment is kept up. There can be seen luxurious carriages, for\\noccasions of ceremony, and the park phaeton, and the simple brougham\\nwhich the Countess uses when she goes out shopping; and that carefully\\ngroomed thoroughbred is Mirette, the favorite riding horse of\\nMademoiselle Sabine. Mascarin and his confederate descended from their\\ncab a little distance at the corner of the Avenue Matignon. Mascarin, in\\nhis dark suit, with his spotless white cravat and glittering spectacles,\\nlooked like some highly respectable functionary of State. Hortebise wore\\nhis usual smile, though his cheek was pale.\\n\\n“Now,” remarked Mascarin, “let me see,--on what footing do you stand\\nwith the Mussidans? Do they look upon you as a friend?”\\n\\n“No, no; a poor doctor, whose ancestors were not among the Crusades,\\ncould not be the intimate friend of such haughty nobles as the\\nMussidans.”\\n\\n“But the Countess knows you, and will not refuse to receive you, nor\\nhave you turned out as soon as you begin to speak; for, taking shelter\\nbehind some rogue without a name, you can shelter your own reputation. I\\nwill see the Count.”\\n\\n“Take care of him,” said Hortebise thoughtfully. “He has a reputation\\nfor being a man of ungovernable temper, and, at the first word from you\\nthat he objects to, would throw you out of the window as soon as look at\\nyou.”\\n\\nMascarin shrugged his shoulders. “I can bring him to reason,” answered\\nhe.\\n\\nThe two confederates walked a little past the Hotel de Mussidan, and the\\ndoctor explained the interior arrangements of the house.\\n\\n“I,” continued Mascarin, “will insist upon the Count’s breaking off his\\ndaughter’s engagement with M. de Breulh-Faverlay, but shall not say\\na word about the Marquis de Croisenois, while you will take the\\nopportunity of putting his pretensions before the Countess, and will not\\nsay a word of M. de Breulh-Faverlay.”\\n\\n“I have learned my lesson, and shall not forget it.”\\n\\n“You see, doctor, the beauty of the whole affair is, that the Countess\\nwill wonder how her husband will take her interference, while he will be\\nat a loss how to break the news to his wife. How surprised they will be\\nwhen they find that they have both the same end in view!”\\n\\nThere was something so droll in the whole affair, that the doctor burst\\ninto a loud laugh.\\n\\n“We go by such different roads,” said he, “that they will never suspect\\nthat we are working together. Faith! my dear Baptiste, you are much more\\nclever than I thought.”\\n\\n“Don’t praise me until you see that I am successful.”\\n\\nMascarin stopped opposite to a _café_ in the Faubourg Saint Honore.\\n\\n“Wait here for me, doctor,” said he, “while I make a little call. If all\\nis all right; I will come for you again; then I will see the Count, and\\ntwenty minutes later do you go to the house and ask for the Countess.”\\n\\nThe clock struck four as the worthy confederates parted, and Mascarin\\ncontinued his way along the Faubourg Saint Honore, and again stopped\\nbefore a public house, which he entered, the master of which, Father\\nCanon, was so well known in the neighborhood that he had not thought it\\nworth while to have his name painted over the door. He did not profess\\nto serve his best wine to casual customers, but for regular frequenters\\nof his house, chiefly the servants of noble families, he kept a better\\nbrand of wine. Mascarin’s respectable appearance inclined the landlord\\nto step forward. Among Frenchmen, who are always full of gayety, a\\nserious exterior is ever an excellent passport.\\n\\n“What can I do for you, sir?” asked he with great politeness.\\n\\n“Can I see Florestan?”\\n\\n“In Count de Mussidan’s service, I believe?”\\n\\n“Just so; I have an appointment with him here.”\\n\\n“He is downstairs in the band-room,” replied the landlord. “I will send\\nfor him.”\\n\\n“Don’t trouble; I will go down,” and, without waiting for permission,\\nMascarin descended some steps that apparently led to a cellar.\\n\\n“It appears to me,” murmured Father Canon, “that I have seen this cove’s\\nface before.”\\n\\nMascarin pushed open a door at the bottom of the flight of stairs, and\\na strange and appalling noise issued from within (but this neither\\nsurprised nor alarmed him), and entered a vaulted room arranged like a\\n_café_, with seats and tables, filled with customers. In the centre, two\\nmen, in their shirt sleeves, with crimson faces, were performing upon\\nhorns; while an old man, with leather gaiters, buttoning to the knee,\\nand a broad leather belt, was whistling the air the hornplayers were\\nexecuting. As Mascarin politely took off his hat, the performers ceased,\\nand the old man discontinued his whistling, while a well-built young\\nfellow, with pumps and stockings, and wearing a fashionable mustache,\\nexclaimed,--\\n\\n“Aha, it is that good old Mascarin. I was expecting you; will you\\ndrink?”\\n\\nWithout waiting for further invitation Mascarin helped himself from a\\nbottle that stood near.\\n\\n“Did Father Canon tell you that I was here?” asked the young man, who\\nwas the Florestan Mascarin had been inquiring for. “You see,” continued\\nhe, “that the police will not permit us to practise the horn; so, you\\nobserve, Father Canon has arranged this underground studio, from whence\\nno sound reaches the upper world.”\\n\\nThe hornplayers had now resumed their lessons, and Florestan was\\ncompelled to place both hands to the side of his mouth, in order to\\nrender himself audible, and to shout with all his might.\\n\\n“That old fellow there is a huntsman in the service of the Duke de\\nChampdoce, and is the finest hornplayer going. I have only had twenty\\nlessons from him, and am getting on wonderfully.”\\n\\n“Ah!” exclaimed Mascarin, “when I have more time I must hear your\\nperformance; but to-day I am in a hurry, and want to say a few words to\\nyou in private.”\\n\\n“Certainly, but suppose we go upstairs and ask for a private room.”\\n\\nThe rooms he referred to were not very luxuriously furnished, but were\\nadmirably suited for confidential communications; and had the walls been\\nable to speak, they could have told many a strange tale.\\n\\nFlorestan and Mascarin seated themselves in one of these before a small\\ntable, upon which Father Canon placed a bottle of wine and two glasses.\\n\\n“I asked you to meet me here, Florestan,” began Mascarin, “because you\\ncan do me a little favor.”\\n\\n“Anything that is in my power I will do,” said the young man.\\n\\n“First, a few words regarding yourself. How do you get on with Count de\\nMussidan?”\\n\\nMascarin had adopted an air of familiarity which he knew would please\\nhis companion.\\n\\n“I don’t care about the place,” replied Florestan, “and I am going to\\nask Beaumarchef to look out another one for me.”\\n\\n“I am surprised at that; all your predecessors said that the Count was a\\nperfect gentleman--”\\n\\n“Just try him yourself,” broke in the valet. “In the first place he is\\nas fickle as the wind, and awfully suspicious. He never leaves anything\\nabout,--no letters, no cigars, and no money. He spends half his time in\\nlocking things up, and goes to bed with his keys under his pillow.”\\n\\n“I allow that such suspicion on his part is most unpleasant.”\\n\\n“It is indeed, and besides he is awfully violent. He gets in a rage\\nabout nothing, and half a dozen times in the day he looks ready to\\nmurder you. On my word, I am really frightened at him.”\\n\\nThis account, coupled with what he had heard from Hortebise seemed to\\nrender Mascarin very thoughtful.\\n\\n“Is he always like this, or only at intervals?”\\n\\n“He is always a beast, but he is worse after drink or losing at cards.\\nHe is never home until after four in the morning.”\\n\\n“And what does his wife say?”\\n\\nThe query made Florestan laugh.\\n\\n“Madame does not bother herself about her lord and master, I can assure\\nyou. Sometimes they don’t meet for weeks. All she wants is plenty of\\nmoney. And ain’t we just dunned!”\\n\\n“But the Mussidans are wealthy?”\\n\\n“Tremendously so, but at times there is not the value of a franc in the\\nhouse. Then Madame is like a tigress, and would sent to borrow from all\\nher friends.”\\n\\n“But she must feel much humiliated?”\\n\\n“Not a bit; when she wants a heavy amount, she sends off to the Duke de\\nChampdoce, and he always parts; but she doesn’t mince matters with him.”\\n\\n“It would seem as if you had known the contents of your mistress’s\\nletters?” remarked Mascarin with a smile.\\n\\n“Of course I have; I like to know what is in the letters I carry about.\\nShe only says, ‘My good friend, I want so much,’ and back comes the\\nmoney without a word. Of course it is easy to see that there has been\\nsomething between them.”\\n\\n“Yes, evidently.”\\n\\n“And when master and missus do meet they only have rows, and such rows!\\nWhen the working man has had a drop too much, he beats his wife, she\\nscreams, then they kiss and make it up; but the Mussidans say things to\\neach other in cold blood that neither can ever forgive.”\\n\\nFrom the air with which Mascarin listened to these details, it almost\\nseemed as if he had been aware of them before.\\n\\n“Then,” said he, “Mademoiselle Sabine is the only nice one in the\\nhouse?”\\n\\n“Yes, she is always gentle and considerate.”\\n\\n“Then you think that M. de Breulh-Faverlay will be a happy man?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; but perhaps this marriage will----” but here Florestan\\ninterrupted himself and assumed an air of extreme caution. After looking\\ncarefully round, he lowered his voice, and continued, “Mademoiselle\\nSabine has been left so much to herself that she acts just as she thinks\\nfit.”\\n\\n“Do you mean,” asked Mascarin, “that the young lady has a lover?”\\n\\n“Just so.”\\n\\n“But that must be wrong; and let me tell you that you ought not to\\nrepeat such a story.”\\n\\nThe man grew quite excited.\\n\\n“Story,” repeated he; “I know what I know. If I spoke of a lover, it is\\nbecause I have seen him with my own eyes, not once, but twice.”\\n\\nFrom the manner in which Mascarin received this intelligence, Florestan\\nsaw that he was interested in the highest degree.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you all about it,” continued he. “The first time was when she\\nwent to mass; it came on to rain suddenly, and Modeste, her maid, begged\\nme to go for an umbrella. As soon as I came back I went in and saw\\nMademoiselle Sabine standing by the receptacle for holy water, talking\\nto a young fellow. Of course I dodged behind a pillar, and kept a watch\\non the pair--”\\n\\n“But you don’t found all your story on this?”\\n\\n“I think you would, had you seen the way they looked into each other’s\\neyes.”\\n\\n“What was he like?”\\n\\n“Very good looking, about my height, with an aristocratic air.”\\n\\n“How about the second time?”\\n\\n“Ah, that is a longer story. I went one day with Mademoiselle when she\\nwas going to see a friend in the Rue Marboeuf. She waited at a corner of\\nthe street, and beckoned me to her. ‘Florestan,’ said she, ‘I forgot to\\npost this letter; go and do so; I will wait here for you.’”\\n\\n“Of course you read it?”\\n\\n“No. I thought there was something wrong. She wants to get rid of you,\\nso, instead of posting it, I slunk behind a tree and waited. I had\\nhardly done so, when the young fellow I had seen at the chapel came\\nround the corner; but I scarcely knew him. He was dressed just like a\\nworking man, in a blouse all over plaster. They talked for about\\nten minutes, and Mademoiselle Sabine gave him what looked like a\\nphotograph.”\\n\\nBy this time the bottle was empty, and Florestan was about to call for\\nanother, when Mascarin checked him, saying--\\n\\n“Not to-day; it is growing late, and I must tell you what I want you to\\ndo for me. Is the Count at home now?”\\n\\n“Of course he is; he has not left his room for two days, owing to having\\nslipped going downstairs.”\\n\\n“Well, my lad, I must see your master; and if I sent up my card, the\\nodds are he would not see me, so I rely upon you to show me up without\\nannouncing me.”\\n\\nFlorestan remained silent for a few minutes.\\n\\n“It is no easy job,” he muttered, “for the Count does not like\\nunexpected visitors, and the Countess is with him just now. However, as\\nI am not going to stay, I’ll chance it.”\\n\\nMascarin rose from his seat.\\n\\n“We must not be seen together,” said he; “I’ll settle the score; do you\\ngo on, and I will follow in five minutes. Remember we don’t know each\\nother.”\\n\\n“I am fly; and mind you look out a good place for me.”\\n\\nMascarin paid the bill, and then looked into the _café_ to inform the\\ndoctor of his movements, and a few minutes later, Florestan in his\\nmost sonorous voice, threw open the door of his master’s room and\\nannounced,--\\n\\n“M. Mascarin.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nA FORGOTTEN CRIME.\\n\\nBaptiste Mascarin had been in so many strange situations, from which he\\nhad extricated himself with safety and credit, that he had the fullest\\nself-confidence, but as he ascended the wide staircase of the Hotel de\\nMussidan, he felt his heart beat quicker in anticipation of the struggle\\nthat was before him. It was twilight out of doors, but all within was\\na blaze of light. The library into which he was ushered was a vast\\napartment, furnished in severe taste. At the sound of the unaristocratic\\nname of Mascarin, which seemed as much out of place as a drunkard’s oath\\nin the chamber of sleeping innocence, M. de Mussidan raised his head\\nin sudden surprise. The Count was seated at the other end of the room,\\nreading by the light of four candles placed in a magnificently wrought\\ncandelabra. He threw down his paper, and raising his glasses, gazed with\\nastonishment at Mascarin, who, with his hat in his hand and his heart\\nin his mouth, slowly crossed the room, muttering a few unintelligible\\napologies. He could make nothing, however, of his visitor, and said,\\n“Whom do you wish to see, sir?”\\n\\n“The Count de Mussidan,” stuttered Mascarin; “and I hope that you will\\nforgive this intrusion.”\\n\\nThe Count cut his excuse short with a haughty wave of his hand. “Wait,”\\n said he imperiously. He then with evident pain rose from his seat, and\\ncrossing the room, rang the bell violently, and then reseated himself.\\nMascarin, who still remained in the centre of the room, inwardly\\nwondered if after all he was to be turned out of the house. In another\\nsecond the door opened, and the figure of the faithful Florestan\\nappeared.\\n\\n“Florestan,” said the Count, angrily, “this is the first time that you\\nhave permitted any one to enter this room without my permission; if this\\noccurs again, you leave my service.”\\n\\n“I assure your lordship,” began the man.\\n\\n“Enough! I have spoken; you know what to expect.”\\n\\nDuring this brief colloquy, Mascarin studied the Count with the deepest\\nattention.\\n\\nThe Count Octave de Mussidan in no way resembled the man sketched by\\nFlorestan. Since the time of Montaigne, a servant’s portrait of his\\nemployer should always be distrusted. The Count looked fully sixty,\\nthough he was but fifty years of age; he was undersized, and he looked\\nshrunk and shrivelled; he was nearly bald, and his long whiskers were\\nperfectly white. The cares of life had imprinted deep furrows on his\\nbrow, and told too plainly the story of a man who, having drained the\\nchalice of life to the bottom, was now ready to shiver the goblet. As\\nFlorestan left the room the Count turned to Mascarin, and in the same\\nglacial tone observed, “And now, sir, explain this intrusion.”\\n\\nMascarin had often been rebuffed, but never so cruelly as this. His\\nvanity was sorely wounded, for he was vain, as all are who think that\\nthey possess some hidden influence, and he felt his temper giving way.\\n\\n“Pompous idiot!” thought he; “we will see how he looks in a short time;”\\n but his face did not betray this, and his manner remained cringing\\nand obsequious. “You have heard my name, my lord, and I am a general\\nbusiness agent.”\\n\\nThe Count was deceived by the honest accents which long practice\\nhad taught Mascarin to use, and he had neither a suspicion nor a\\npresentiment.\\n\\n“Ah!” said he majestically, “a business agent, are you? I presume you\\ncome on behalf of one of my creditors. Well, sir, as I have before told\\nthese people, your errand is a futile one. Why do they worry me when I\\nunhesitatingly pay the extravagant interest they are pleased to demand?\\nThey know that they are all knaves. They are aware that I am rich, for I\\nhave inherited a great fortune, which is certainly without encumbrance;\\nfor though I could raise a million to-morrow upon my estates in\\nPoitiers, I have up to this time not chosen to do so.”\\n\\nMascarin had at length so recovered his self-command that he listened to\\nthis speech without a word, hoping to gain some information from it.\\n\\n“You may tell this,” continued the Count, “to those by whom you are\\nemployed.”\\n\\n“Excuse me, my lord--”\\n\\n“But what?”\\n\\n“I cannot allow--”\\n\\n“I have nothing more to say; all will be settled as I promised, when I\\npay my daughter’s dowry. You are aware that she will shortly be united\\nto M. de Breulh-Faverlay.”\\n\\nThere was no mistaking the order to go, contained in these words,\\nbut Mascarin did not offer to do so, but readjusting his spectacles,\\nremarked in a perfectly calm voice,--\\n\\n“It is this marriage that has brought me here.”\\n\\nThe Count thought that his ears had deceived him. “What are you saying?”\\n said he.\\n\\n“I say,” repeated the agent, “that I am sent to you in connection with\\nthis same marriage.”\\n\\nNeither the doctor nor Florestan had exaggerated the violence of the\\nCount’s temper. Upon hearing his daughter’s name and marriage mentioned\\nby this man, his face grew crimson and his eyes gleamed with a lurid\\nfire.\\n\\n“Get out of this!” cried he, angrily.\\n\\nBut this was an order that Mascarin had no intention of obeying.\\n\\n“I assure you that what I have to say is of the utmost importance,” said\\nhe.\\n\\nThis speech put the finishing touch to the Count’s fury.\\n\\n“You won’t go, won’t you?” said he; and in spite of the pain that at the\\nmoment evidently oppressed him, he stepped to the bell, but was arrested\\nby Mascarin, uttering in a warning voice the words,--\\n\\n“Take care; if you ring that bell, you will regret it to the last day of\\nyour life.”\\n\\nThis was too much for the Count’s patience, and letting go the bell\\nrope, he snatched up a walking cane that was leaning against the\\nchimneypiece, and made a rush toward his visitor. But Mascarin did not\\nmove or lift his hand in self-defence, contenting himself with saying\\ncalmly,--\\n\\n“No violence, Count; remember Montlouis.”\\n\\nAt this name the Count grew livid, and dropping the cane from his\\nnerveless hand staggered back a pace or two. Had a spectre suddenly\\nstood up before him with threatening hand, he could not have been more\\nhorrified.\\n\\n“Montlouis!” he murmured; “Montlouis!”\\n\\nBut now Mascarin, thoroughly assured of the value of his weapon, had\\nresumed all his humbleness of demeanor.\\n\\n“Believe me, my lord,” said he, “that I only mentioned this name on\\naccount of the immediate danger that threatens you.”\\n\\nThe Count hardly seemed to pay attention to his visitor’s words.\\n\\n“It was not I,” continued Mascarin, “who devised the project of bringing\\nagainst you an act which was perhaps a mere accident. I am only a\\nplenipotentiary from persons I despise, to you, for whom I entertain the\\nvery highest respect.”\\n\\nBy this time the Count had somewhat recovered himself.\\n\\n“I really do not understand you,” said he, in a tone he vainly\\nendeavored to render calm. “My sudden emotion is only too easily\\nexplained. I had a sad misfortune. I accidentally shot my secretary, and\\nthe poor young man bore the name you just now mentioned; but the court\\nacquitted me of all blame in the matter.”\\n\\nThe smile upon Mascarin’s face was so full of sarcasm that the Count\\nbroke off.\\n\\n“Those who sent me here,” remarked the agent, slowly, “are well\\nacquainted with the evidence produced in court; but unfortunately, they\\nknow the real facts, which certain honorable gentlemen had sense to\\nconceal at any risk.”\\n\\nAgain the Count started, but Mascarin went on implacably,--\\n\\n“But reassure yourself, your friend did not betray you voluntarily.\\nProvidence, in her inscrutable decrees----”\\n\\nThe Count shuddered.\\n\\n“In short, sir, in short----”\\n\\nUp to this time Mascarin had remained standing, but now that he saw that\\nhis position was fully established, he drew up a chair and sat down.\\nThe Count grew more livid at this insolent act, but made no comment, and\\nthis entirely removed any doubts from the agent’s mind.\\n\\n“The event to which I have alluded has two eye-witnesses, the Baron de\\nClinchain, and a servant, named Ludovic Trofin, now in the employ of the\\nCount du Commarin.”\\n\\n“I did not know what had become of Trofin.”\\n\\n“Perhaps not, but my people do. When he swore to keep the matter secret,\\nhe was unmarried, but a few years later, having entered the bonds of\\nmatrimony, he told all to his young wife. This woman turned out badly;\\nshe had several lovers, and through one of them the matter came to my\\nemployer’s ears.”\\n\\n“And it was on the word of a lackey, and the gossip of a dissolute\\nwoman, that they have dared to accuse me.”\\n\\nNo word of direct accusation had passed, and yet the Count sought to\\ndefend himself.\\n\\nMascarin saw all this, and smiled inwardly, as he replied, “We have\\nother evidence than that of Ludovic.”\\n\\n“But,” said the Count, who was sure of the fidelity of his friend, “you\\ndo not, I suppose, pretend that the Baron de Clinchain has deceived me?”\\n\\nThe state of mental anxiety and perturbation into which this man of the\\nworld had been thrown must have been very intense for him not to\\nhave perceived that every word he uttered put a fresh weapon in his\\nadversary’s hands.\\n\\n“He has not denounced you by word of mouth,” replied the agent. “He has\\ndone far more; he has written his testimony.”\\n\\n“It is a lie,” exclaimed the Count.\\n\\nMascarin was not disturbed by this insult.\\n\\n“The Baron has written,” repeated he, “though he never thought that any\\neye save his own would read what he had penned. As you are aware,\\nthe Baron de Clinchain is a most methodical man, and punctilious to a\\ndegree.”\\n\\n“I allow that; continue.”\\n\\n“Consequently you will not be surprised to learn that from his earliest\\nyears he has kept a diary, and each day he puts down in the most minute\\nmanner everything that has occurred, even to the different conditions of\\nhis bodily health.”\\n\\nThe Count knew of his friend’s foible, and remembered that when they\\nwere young many a practical joke had been played upon his friend on this\\naccount, and now he began to perceive the dangerous ground upon which he\\nstood.\\n\\n“On hearing the facts of the case from Ludovic’s wife’s lover,”\\n continued Mascarin, “my employers decided that if the tale was a true\\none, some mention of it would be found in the Baron’s diary; and thanks\\nto the ingenuity and skill of certain parties, they have had in their\\npossession for twenty-four hours the volume for the year 1842.”\\n\\n“Scoundrels!” muttered the Count.\\n\\n“They find not only one, but three distinct statements relating to the\\naffair in question.”\\n\\nThe Count started again to his feet with so menacing a look, that the\\nworthy Mascarin pushed back his chair in anticipation of an immediate\\nassault.\\n\\n“Proofs!” gasped the Count. “Give me proofs.”\\n\\n“Everything has been provided for, and the three leaves by which you are\\nso deeply compromised have been cut from the book.”\\n\\n“Where are these pages?”\\n\\nMascarin at once put on an air of injured innocence.\\n\\n“I have not seen them, but the leaves have been photographed, and a\\nprint has been entrusted to me, in order to enable you to recognize the\\nwriting.”\\n\\nAs he spoke he produced three specimens of the photographic art,\\nwonderfully clear and full of fidelity. The Count examined them with the\\nutmost attention, and then in a voice which trembled with emotion, he\\nsaid, “True enough, it is his handwriting.”\\n\\nNot a line upon Mascarin’s face indicated the delight with which he\\nreceived this admission.\\n\\n“Before continuing the subject,” he observed placidly, “I consider it\\nnecessary for you to understand the position taken up by the Baron de\\nClinchain. Do you wish, my lord, to read these extracts, or shall I do\\nso for you?”\\n\\n“Read,” answered the Count, adding in a lower voice, “I cannot see to do\\nso.”\\n\\nMascarin drew his chair nearer to the lights on the table. “I perceive,”\\n said he, “that the first entry was made on the evening after the--well,\\nthe accident. This is it: ‘October 26, 1842. Early this morning went\\nout shooting with Octave de Mussidan. We were accompanied by Ludovic, a\\ngroom, and by a young man named Montlouis, whom Octave intends one day\\nto make his steward. It was a splendid day, and by twelve o’clock I had\\nkilled a leash of hares. Octave was in excellent spirits, and by one\\no’clock we were in a thick cover not far from Bevron. I and Ludovic were\\na few yards in front of the others, when angry voices behind attracted\\nour attention. Octave and Montlouis were arguing violently, and all\\nat once the Count struck his future steward a violent blow. In another\\nmoment Montlouis came up to me. ‘What is the matter?’ cried I. Instead\\nof replying to my question, the unhappy young man turned back to\\nhis master, uttering a series of threats. Octave had evidently been\\nreproaching him for some low intrigue he had been engaged in, and\\nwas reflecting upon the character of the woman. ‘At any rate,’ cried\\nMontlouis, ‘she is quite as virtuous as Madame de Mussidan was before\\nher marriage.’”\\n\\n“‘As Octave heard these words, he raised the loaded gun he held in his\\nhand and fired. Montlouis fell to the ground, bathed in blood. We\\nall ran up to him, but he was quite dead, for the charge of shot had\\npenetrated his heart. I was almost beside myself, but Octave’s despair\\nwas terrible to witness. Tearing his hair, he knelt beside the dead man.\\nLudovic, however, maintained his calmness. “We must say that it was an\\naccident,” observed he quickly. “Thinking that Montlouis was not near,\\nmy master fired into cover.”\\n\\n“‘This was agreed to, and we carefully arranged what we should say. It\\nwas I who went before the magistrate and made a deposition, which was\\nunhesitatingly received. But, oh, what a fearful day! My pulse is at\\neighty, and I feel I shall not sleep all night. Octave is half mad, and\\nHeaven knows what will become of him.’”\\n\\nThe Count, from the depths of his armchair, listened without apparent\\nemotion to this terrible revelation. He was quite crushed, and was\\nsearching for some means to exorcise the green spectre of the past,\\nwhich had so suddenly confronted him. Mascarin never took his eyes off\\nhim. All at once the Count roused himself from his prostration, as a man\\nawakes from a hideous dream. “This is sheer folly,” cried he.\\n\\n“It is folly,” answered Mascarin, “that would carry much weight with\\nit.”\\n\\n“And suppose I were to show you,” returned the Count, “that all these\\nentries are the offspring of a diseased mind?”\\n\\nMascarin shook his head with an air of affected grief. “There is no\\nuse, my lord, in indulging in vain hopes. We,” he continued, wishing\\nto associate himself with the Count, “we might of course admit that\\nthe Baron de Clinchain had made this entry in his diary in a moment of\\ntemporary insanity, were it not for the painful fact that there were\\nothers. Le me read them.”\\n\\n“Go on; I am all attention.”\\n\\n“We find the following, three days later: ‘Oct. 29th, 1842. I am most\\nuneasy about my health. I feel shooting pains in all my joints. The\\nderangement of my system arises entirely from this business of Octave’s.\\nI had to run the gauntlet of a second court, and the judge’s eyes seemed\\nto look me through and through. I also saw with much alarm that my\\nsecond statement differs somewhat from the first one, so I have\\nnow learned it by heart. Ludovic is a sharp fellow, and quite\\nself-possessed. I would like to have him in my household. I keep myself\\nshut up in my house for fear of meeting friends who want to hear all the\\ndetails of the accident. I believe I may say that I have repeated the\\nstory more than a couple of dozen times.’ Now, my lord,” added Mascarin,\\n“what do you say to this?”\\n\\n“Continue the reading of the extracts.”\\n\\n“The third allusion, though it is short, is still very important:\\n‘November 3rd, 1842. Thank Heaven! all is over. I have just returned\\nfrom the court. Octave has been acquitted. Ludovic had behaved\\nwonderfully. He explained the reason of the misadventure in a way that\\nwas really surprising in an uneducated man, and there was not an atom\\nof suspicion among judge, jury, or spectators. I have changed my mind;\\nI would not have a fellow like Ludovic in my service; he is much too\\nsharp. When I had been duly sworn, I gave my evidence. Though I was much\\nagitated, I went through it all right; but when I got home I felt\\nvery ill, and discovered that my pulse was down to fifty. Ah, me! what\\nterrible misfortunes are wrought by a momentary burst of anger. I now\\nwrite this sentence in my diary: _“Never give way to first impulses.”_’\\nThese words,” continued Mascarin, “were inscribed on every one of the\\npages following,--at least so those who examined the entries informed\\nme.”\\n\\nMascarin persisted in representing himself as the agent of others, but\\nstill the Count made no allusion to the persons in the background.\\n\\nAfter a few moments the Count rose and limped up and down, as though he\\nhoped by this means to collect his ideas, or perhaps in order to prevent\\nhis visitor from scanning his face too closely.\\n\\n“Have you done?” asked he, all at once.\\n\\n“Yes, my lord.”\\n\\n“Have you thought what an impartial judge would say?”\\n\\n“I think I have.”\\n\\n“He would say,” broke in the Count, “that no sane man would have written\\nsuch things down, for there are certain secrets which we do not whisper\\neven to ourselves, and it is hardly likely that any man would make such\\ncompromising entries in a diary which might be lost or stolen, and which\\nwould certainly be read by his heir. Do you think that a man of high\\nposition would record his perjury, which is a crime that would send him\\nto penal servitude?”\\n\\nMascarin gazed upon the Count with an air of pity.\\n\\n“You are not going the right way, my lord, to get out of your trouble.\\nNo lawyer would adopt your theory. If the remaining volumes of M. de\\nClinchain’s diaries were produced in court, I imagine that other equally\\nstartling entries would be found in them.”\\n\\nThe Count now appeared to have arrived at some decision, and to continue\\nthe conversation simply for the purpose of gaining time.\\n\\n“Well,” said he, “I will give up this idea; but how do I know that\\nthese documents are not forgeries? Nowadays, handwritings are easily\\nfacsimilied, when even bankers find it hard to distinguish between their\\nown notes and counterfeit ones.”\\n\\n“That can be settled by seeing if certain leaves are missing from the\\nBaron’s diary.”\\n\\n“That does not prove much.”\\n\\n“Pardon me, it proves a great deal. This new line of argument, I assure\\nyou, will avail you as little as the other. I am perfectly aware that\\nthe Baron de Clinchain will utter whatever words you may place in his\\nmouth. Let us suppose that the leaves which have been torn out should\\nfit into the book exactly. Would not that be a strong point?”\\n\\nThe Count smiled ironically, as though he had a crushing reply in\\nreserve.\\n\\n“And so this is your opinion, is it?” said he.\\n\\n“It is indeed.”\\n\\n“Then all I have to do is to plead guilty. I did kill Montlouis, just\\nas Clinchain describes, but----” and as he spoke he took a heavy volume\\nfrom a shelf, and opening it at a certain place laid it before Mascarin,\\nremarking,--“this is the criminal code; read. ‘All proceedings in\\ncriminal law shall be cancelled after a lapse of ten years.’”\\n\\nThe Count de Mussidan evidently thought that he had crushed his\\nadversary by this shattering blow; but it was not so, for instead of\\nexhibiting any surprise, Mascarin’s smile was as bland as ever.\\n\\n“I, too, know a little of the law,” said he. “The very first day this\\nmatter was brought to me, I turned to this page and read what you have\\njust shown me to my employers.”\\n\\n“And what did they say?”\\n\\n“That they knew all this, but that you would be glad to compromise the\\naffair, even at the expense of half your fortune.”\\n\\nThe agent’s manner was so confident that the Count felt they had\\ndiscovered some means of turning this crime of his early days to\\nadvantage; but he was still sufficiently master of himself to show no\\nemotion.\\n\\n“No,” replied he, “it is not such an easy matter as you think to get\\nhold of half my fortune. I fancy that your friends’ demands will assume\\na more modest tone, the more so when I repeat that these morsels of\\npaper, stolen from my friend’s diary, are absolutely worthless.”\\n\\n“Do you think so?”\\n\\n“Certainly, for the law on this matter speaks plainly enough.”\\n\\nMascarin readjusted his glasses, a sure indication that he was going to\\nmake an important reply.\\n\\n“You are quite right, my lord,” said he, slowly. “There is no intention\\nof taking you before any court, for there is no penalty now for a crime\\ncommitted twenty-three years ago; but the miserable wretches whom I\\nblush to act for have arranged a plan which will be disagreeable in the\\nhighest degree both for you and the Baron.”\\n\\n“Pray tell me what this clever plan is.”\\n\\n“Most certainly. I came here to-day for this very purpose. Let us first\\nconclude that you have rejected the request with which I approached\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Do you call this style of thing a request?”\\n\\n“What is the use of quarrelling over words. Well, to-morrow, my\\nclients--though I am ashamed to speak of them as such--will send to\\na well known morning paper a tale, with the title, ‘Story of a Day’s\\nShooting.’ Of course only initials will be used for the names, but no\\ndoubt will exist as to the identity of the actors in the tragedy.”\\n\\n“You forget that in actions for libel proofs are not admitted.”\\n\\nMascarin shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“My employers forget nothing,” remarked he; “and it is upon this very\\npoint that they have based their plans For this reason they introduce\\ninto the matter a fifth party, of course an accomplice, whose name is\\nintroduced into the story in the paper. Upon the day of its appearance,\\nthis man lodges a complaint against the journal, and insists on proving\\nin a court of justice, that he did not form one of the shooting-party.”\\n\\n“Well, what happens then?”\\n\\n“Then, my lord, this man insists that the journal should give a\\nretraction of the injurious statement and summons as witnesses both\\nyourself and the Baron de Clinchain, and as a conclusion, Ludovic;\\nand as he claims damages, he employs a lawyer, who is one of the\\nconfederates and behind the scenes. The lawyer will speak something to\\nthis effect: ‘That the Count de Mussidan is clearly a murderer; that\\nthe Baron de Clinchain is a perjurer, as proved by his own handwriting;\\nLudovic has been tampered with, but my client, an honorable man, must\\nnot be classed with these, etc., etc.’ Have I made myself understood?”\\n\\nIndeed, he had, and with such cold and merciless logic that it seemed\\nhopeless to expect to escape from the net that had been spread.\\n\\nAs these thoughts passed through the Count’s brain, he saw at a glance\\nthe whole terrible notoriety that the case would cause, and society\\ngloating over the details. Yet such was the obstinacy of his\\ndisposition, and so impatient was he of control, that the more desperate\\nhis position seemed, the fiercer was his resistance. He knew the world\\nwell, and he also knew that the cutthroats who demanded his money with\\nthreats had every reason to dread the lynx eye of the law. If he refused\\nto listen to them, as his heart urged him, perhaps they would not dare\\nto carry out their threats. Had he alone been concerned in the matter,\\nhe would have resisted to the last, and fought it out to the last drop\\nof his blood, and as a preliminary, would have beaten the sneering rogue\\nbefore him to a jelly; but how dared he expose his friend Clinchain, who\\nhad already braved so much for him? As he paced up and down the library,\\nthese and many other thoughts swept across his brain, and he was\\nundecided whether to submit to these extortions or throw the agent out\\nof the window. His excited demeanor and the occasional interjections\\nthat burst from his lips showed Mascarin that the account of him was\\nnot exaggerated, and that when led by passion he would as soon shoot\\na fellow-creature as a rabbit. And yet, though he knew not whether he\\nshould make his exit by the door or the window, he sat twirling his\\nfingers with the most unconcerned air imaginable. At last the Count gave\\near to prudence. He stopped in front of the agent, and, taking no pains\\nto hide his contempt, said,--\\n\\n“Come, let us make an end of this. How much do you want for these\\npapers?”\\n\\n“Oh, my lord!” exclaimed Mascarin; “surely you do not think that I could\\nbe guilty----?”\\n\\nM. de Mussidan shrugged his shoulders. “Pray, do not take me for a\\nfool,” said he, “but name your sum.”\\n\\nMascarin seemed a little embarrassed, and hesitated. “We don’t want\\nmoney,” answered he at length.\\n\\n“Not money!” replied the Count.\\n\\n“We want something that is of no importance to you, but of the utmost\\nvalue to those who despatched me here. I am commissioned to inform you\\nthat my clients desire that you should break off the engagement between\\nyour daughter and M. de Breulh-Faverlay, and that the missing paper will\\nbe handed to you on the completion of her marriage with any else whom\\nyou may deem worthy of such an honor.”\\n\\nThis demand, which was utterly unexpected, so astonished the Count that\\nhe could only exclaim, “Why, this is absolute madness!”\\n\\n“No; it is plain, good sense, and a _bona fide_ offer.”\\n\\nAn idea suddenly flashed across the Count’s mind. “Is it your\\nintention,” asked he, “to furnish me with a son-in-law too?”\\n\\n“I am sure, my lord,” answered Mascarin, looking the picture of\\ndisinterested honesty, “that, even to save yourself, you would never\\nsacrifice your daughter.”\\n\\n“But--”\\n\\n“You are entirely mistaken; it is M. de Breulh-Faverlay whom my clients\\nwish to strike at, for they have taken an oath that he shall never wed a\\nlady with a million for her dowry.”\\n\\nSo surprised was the Count, that the whole aspect of the interview\\nseemed to have changed, and he now combated his own objections instead\\nof those of his unwelcome visitor. “M. de Breulh-Faverlay has my\\npromise,” remarked he; “but of course it is easy to find a pretext. The\\nCountess, however, is in favor of the match, and the chief opposition to\\nany change will come from her.”\\n\\nMascarin did not think it wise to make any reply, and the Count\\ncontinued, “My daughter also may not view this rupture with\\nsatisfaction.”\\n\\nThanks to the information he had received from Florestan, Mascarin knew\\nhow much importance to attach to this. “Mademoiselle, at her age and\\nwith her tastes, is not likely to have her heart seriously engaged.” For\\nfully a quarter of an hour the Count still hesitated. He knew that he\\nwas entirely at the mercy of those miscreants, and his pride revolted at\\nthe idea of submission; but at length he yielded.\\n\\n“I agree,” said he. “My daughter shall not marry M. de Breulh-Faverlay.”\\n\\nEven in his hour of triumph, Mascarin’s face did not change. He bowed\\nprofoundly, and left the room; but as he descended the stairs, he rubbed\\nhis hands, exclaiming, “If the doctor has made as good a job of it as I\\nhave, success is certain.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nA MEDICAL ADVISER.\\n\\nDoctor Hortebise did not find it necessary to resort to any of those\\nexpedients which Mascarin had found it advisable to use in order to\\nreach Madame de Mussidan. As soon as he presented himself--that is,\\nafter a brief interval of five minutes--he was introduced into the\\npresence of the Countess. He rather wondered at this, for Madame de\\nMussidan was one of those restless spirits that are seldom found at\\nhome, but are to be met with at exhibitions, on race-courses, at the\\n_salons_, restaurants, shops, or theatres; or at the studio of some\\nfamous artist; or at the rooms of some musical professor who had\\ndiscovered a new tenor; anywhere and everywhere, in fact, except at\\nhome. Hers was one of those restless natures constantly craving for\\nexcitement; and husband, home, and child were mere secondary objects in\\nher eyes. She had many avocations; she was a patroness of half a dozen\\ncharitable institutions, but the chief thing that she did was to spend\\nmoney. Gold seemed to melt in her grasp like so much snow, and she never\\nknew what became of the sums she lavished so profusely. Husband and\\nwife had long been almost totally estranged, and led almost separate\\nexistences. Dr. Hortebise was well aware of this, in common with others\\nwho moved in society. Upon the appearance of the doctor, the Countess\\ndropped the book she had been perusing, and gave vent to an exclamation\\nof delight. “Ah, doctor, this is really very kind of you;” and at the\\nsame time signed to the servant to place a chair for the visitor.\\n\\nThe Countess was tall and slender, and at forty-five had the figure of\\na girl. She had an abundance of fair hair, the color of which concealed\\nthe silver threads which plentifully interspersed it. A subtle perfume\\nhung about her, and her pale blue eyes were full of pride and cold\\ndisdain.\\n\\n“You know how to time your visits so well, doctor!” said she. “I am\\nthoroughly bored, and am utterly weary of books, for it always seems to\\nme, when I read, that I had perused the same thing before somewhere or\\nother. You have arrived at so opportune a moment, that you appear to be\\na favorite of timely chance.”\\n\\nThe doctor was indeed a favorite of chance; but the name of the chance\\nwas Baptiste Mascarin.\\n\\n“I see so few visitors,” continued Madame de Mussidan, “that hardly any\\none comes to see me. I must really set aside one day in the week for my\\nat home; for when I do happen to stay at home, I feel fearfully dull\\nand lonely. For two mortal hours I have been in this room. I have been\\nnursing the Count.”\\n\\nThe doctor knew better than this; but he smiled pleasantly, and said,\\n“Perfectly so,” exactly at the right moment.\\n\\n“Yes,” continued the Countess, “my husband slipped on the stairs, and\\nhurt himself very much. Our doctor says it is nothing; but then I put\\nlittle faith in what doctors say.”\\n\\n“I know that by experience, madame,” replied Hortebise.\\n\\n“Present company of course always excepted; but, do you know, I once\\nreally believed in you; but your sudden conversion to homeopathy quite\\nfrightened me.”\\n\\nThe doctor smiled. “It is as safe a mode of practice as any other.”\\n\\n“Do you really think so?”\\n\\n“I am perfectly sure of it.”\\n\\n“Well, now that you _are_ here, I am half inclined to ask your advice.”\\n\\n“I trust that you are not suffering.”\\n\\n“No, thank heaven; I have never any cause to complain of my health; but\\nI am very anxious about Sabine’s state.”\\n\\nHer affection of maternal solicitude was a charming pendant to her\\ndisplay of conjugal affection, and again the doctor’s expression of\\nassent came in in the right place.\\n\\n“Yes, for a month, doctor, I have hardly seen Sabine, I have been so\\nmuch engaged; but yesterday I met her, and was quite shocked at the\\nchange in her appearance.”\\n\\n“Did you ask her what ailed her?”\\n\\n“Of course, and she said, ‘Nothing,’ adding that she was perfectly\\nwell.”\\n\\n“Perhaps something had vexed her?”\\n\\n“She,--why, don’t you know that every one likes her, and that she is one\\nof the happiest girls in Paris; but I want you to see her in spite of\\nthat.” She rang the bell as she spoke, and as soon as the footman made\\nhis appearance, said, “Lubin, ask Mademoiselle to have the goodness to\\nstep downstairs.”\\n\\n“Mademoiselle has gone out, madame.”\\n\\n“Indeed! how long ago?”\\n\\n“About three o’clock, madame.”\\n\\n“Who went with her?”\\n\\n“Her maid, Modeste.”\\n\\n“Did Mademoiselle say where she was going to?”\\n\\n“No, madame.”\\n\\n“Very well, you can go.”\\n\\nEven the imperturbable doctor was rather surprised at a girl of eighteen\\nbeing permitted so much freedom.\\n\\n“It is most annoying,” said the Countess. “However, let us hope that the\\ntrifling indisposition, regarding which I wished to consult you, will\\nnot prevent her marriage.”\\n\\nHere was the opening that Hortebise desired.\\n\\n“Is Mademoiselle going to be married?” asked he with an air of\\nrespectful curiosity.\\n\\n“Hush!” replied Madame de Mussidan, placing her finger on her lips;\\n“this is a profound secret, and there is nothing definitely arranged;\\nbut you, as a doctor, are a perfect father confessor, and I feel that\\nI can trust you. Let me whisper to you that it is quite possible that\\nSabine will be Madame de Breulh-Faverlay before the close of the year.”\\n\\nHortebise had not Mascarin’s courage; indeed, he was frequently\\nterrified at his confederate’s projects; but having once given in his\\nadherence, he was to be relied on, and did not hesitate for a moment.\\n“I confess, madame, that I heard that mentioned before;” returned he\\ncautiously.\\n\\n“And, pray, who was your informant?”\\n\\n“Oh, I have had it from many sources; and let me say at once that it was\\nthis marriage, and no mere chance, that brought me here to-day.”\\n\\nMadame de Mussidan liked the doctor and his pleasant and witty\\nconversation very much, and was always charmed to see him; but it\\nwas intolerable that he should venture to interfere in her daughter’s\\nmarriage. “Really, sir, you confer a great honor upon the Count and\\nmyself,” answered she haughtily.\\n\\nHer severe manner, however, did not cause the doctor to lose his temper.\\nHe had come to say certain things in a certain manner. He had learned\\nhis part, and nothing that the Countess could say would prevent his\\nplaying it.\\n\\n“I assure you, madame,” returned he, “that when I accepted the mission\\nwith which I am charged, I only did so from my feelings of respect to\\nyou and yours.”\\n\\n“You are really very kind,” answered the Countess superciliously.\\n\\n“And I am sure, madame, that after you have heard what I have to say,\\nyou will have even more reason to agree with me.” His manner as he\\nsaid this was so peculiar, that the Countess started as though she had\\nreceived a galvanic shock. “For more than twenty-five years,” pursued\\nthe doctor, “I have been the constant depository of strange family\\nsecrets, and some of them have been very terrible ones. I have\\noften found myself in a very delicate position, but never in such an\\nembarrassing one as I am now.”\\n\\n“You alarm me,” said the Countess, dropping her impatient manner.\\n\\n“If, madame, what I have come to relate to you are the mere ravings of\\na lunatic, I will offer my most sincere apologies; but if, on the\\ncontrary, his statements are true--and he has irrefragable proofs in his\\npossession,--then, madame----”\\n\\n“What then, doctor?”\\n\\n“Then, madame, I can only say, make every use of me, for I will\\nwillingly place my life at your disposal.”\\n\\nThe Countess uttered a laugh as artificial as the tears of\\nlong-expectant heirs. “Really,” said she, “your solemn air and tones\\nalmost kill me with laughter.”\\n\\n“She laughs too heartily, and at the wrong time. Mascarin is right,”\\n thought the doctor. “I trust, madame,” continued he, “that I too may\\nlaugh at my own imaginary fears; but whatever may be the result, permit\\nme to remind you that a little time back you said that a doctor was a\\nfather confessor; for, like a priest, the physician only hears secrets\\nin order to forget them. He is also more fitted to console and advise,\\nfor, as his profession brings him into contact with the frailties and\\npassions of the world, he can comprehend and excuse.”\\n\\n“And you must not forget, doctor, that like the priest also, he preaches\\nvery long sermons.”\\n\\nAs she uttered this sarcasm, there was a jesting look upon her features,\\nbut it elicited no smile from Hortebise, who, as he proceeded, grew more\\ngrave.\\n\\n“I may be foolish,” he said; “but I had better be that than reopen some\\nold wound.”\\n\\n“Do not be afraid, doctor; speak out.”\\n\\n“Then, I will begin by asking if you have any remembrance of a young man\\nin your own sphere of society, who, at the time of your marriage,\\nwas well known in every Parisian _salon_. I speak of the Marquis de\\nCroisenois.”\\n\\nThe Countess leaned back in her chair, and contracted her brow, and\\npursed up her lips, as though vainly endeavoring to remember the name.\\n\\n“The Marquis de Croisenois?” repeated she. “It seems as if----no--wait a\\nmoment. No; I cannot say that I can call any such person to mind.”\\n\\nThe doctor felt that he must give the spur to this rebellious memory.\\n\\n“Yes, Croisenois,” he repeated. “His Christian name was George, and he\\nhad a brother Henry, whom you certainly must know, for this winter I saw\\nhim at the Duchess de Laumeuse’s, dancing with your daughter.”\\n\\n“You are right; I remember the name now.”\\n\\nHer manner was indifferent and careless as she said this.\\n\\n“Then perhaps you also recollect that some twenty-three years ago,\\nGeorge de Croisenois vanished suddenly. This disappearance caused a\\nterrible commotion at the time, and was one of the chief topics of\\nsociety.”\\n\\n“Ah! indeed?” mused the Countess.\\n\\n“He was last seen at the Café de Paris, where he dined with some\\nfriends. About nine he got up to leave. One of his friends proposed to\\ngo with him, but he begged him not to do so, saying, ‘Perhaps I shall\\nsee you later on at the opera, but do not count on me.’ The general\\nimpression was that he was going to some love tryst.”\\n\\n“His friends thought that, I suppose.”\\n\\n“Yes, for he was attired with more care than usual, though he was always\\none of the best dressed men in Paris. He went out alone, and was never\\nseen again.”\\n\\n“Never again,” repeated the Countess, a slight shade passing across her\\nbrow.\\n\\n“Never again,” echoed the unmoved doctor. “At first his friends\\nmerely thought his absence strange; but at the end of a week they grew\\nanxious.”\\n\\n“You go very much into details.”\\n\\n“I heard them all at the time, madame, and they were only brought back\\nto my memory this morning. All are to be found in the records of a\\nminute search that the authorities caused to be made into the affair.\\nThe friends of De Croisenois had commenced the search; but when they\\nfound their efforts useless, they called in the aid of the police. The\\nfirst idea was suicide: George might have gone into some lonely spot and\\nblown out his brains. There was no reason for this; he had ample means,\\nand always appeared contented and happy. Then it was believed that a\\nmurder had been committed, and fresh inquiries were instituted, but\\nnothing could be discovered--nothing.”\\n\\nThe Countess affected to stifle a yawn, and repeated like an echo,\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\n“Three months later, when the police had given up the matter in despair,\\none of George de Croisenois’ friends received a letter from him.”\\n\\n“He was not dead then, after all?”\\n\\nDr. Hortebise made a mental note of the tone and manner of the Countess,\\nto consider over at his leisure.\\n\\n“Who can say?” returned he. “The envelope bore the Cairo post-mark. In\\nit George declared that, bored with Parisian life, he was going to start\\non an exploring expedition to Central Africa, and that no one need be\\nanxious about him. People thought this letter highly suspicious. A man\\ndoes not start upon such an expedition as this without money; and it was\\nconclusively proved that on the day of De Croisenois’ disappearance\\nhe had not more than a thousand francs about him, half of which was in\\nSpanish doubloons, won at whist before dinner. The letter was therefore\\nregarded as a trick to turn the police off the scent; but the best\\nexperts asserted that the handwriting was George’s own. Two detectives\\nwere at once despatched to Cairo, but neither there nor anywhere on the\\nroad were any traces of the missing man discovered.”\\n\\nAs the doctor spoke, he kept his eyes riveted on the Countess, but her\\nface was impassable.\\n\\n“Is that all?” asked she.\\n\\nDr. Hortebise paused a few moments before he replied, and then answered\\nslowly,--\\n\\n“A man came to me yesterday, and asserts that you can tell me what has\\nbecome of George de Croisenois.”\\n\\nA man could not have displayed the nerve evinced by this frail and\\ntender woman, for however callous he may be, some feature will betray\\nthe torture he is enduring; but a woman can often turn a smiling face\\nupon the person who is racking her very soul. At the mere name of\\nMontlouis the Count had staggered, as though crushed down by a blow from\\na sledge hammer; but at this accusation of Hortebise the Countess burst\\ninto a peal of laughter, apparently perfectly frank and natural, which\\nutterly prevented her from replying.\\n\\n“My dear doctor,” said she at length, as soon as she could manage to\\nspeak, “your tale is highly sensational and amusing, but I really think\\nthat you ought to consult a _clairvoyant_, and not a matter-of-fact\\nperson like me, about the fate of George de Croisenois.”\\n\\nBut the doctor, who was ready with his retort, and, not at all\\ndisconcerted by the cachinations of the Countess, heaved a deep sigh, as\\nthough a great load had been removed from his heart, and, with an air of\\nextreme delight, exclaimed, “Thank Heaven! then I was deceived.”\\n\\nHe uttered these words with an affectation of such sincerity that the\\nCountess fell into the trap.\\n\\n“Come,” said she, with a winning smile, “tell me who it is that says I\\nknow so much.”\\n\\n“Pooh! pooh!” returned Hortebise. “What good would that do? He has made\\na fool of me, and caused me to risk losing your good opinion. Is not\\nthat enough? To-morrow, when he comes to my house, my servants will\\nrefuse to admit him; but if I were to do as my inclinations lead me, I\\nshould hand him over to the police.”\\n\\n“That would never do,” returned the Countess, “for that would change\\na mere nothing into a matter of importance. Tell me the name of your\\nmysterious informer. Do I know him?”\\n\\n“It is impossible that you could do so, madame, for he is far below you\\nin the social grade. You would learn nothing from his name. He is a man\\nI once helped, and is called Daddy Tantaine.”\\n\\n“A mere nickname, of course.”\\n\\n“He is miserably poor, a cynic, philosopher, but as sharp as a needle;\\nand this last fact causes me great uneasiness, for at first I thought\\nthat he had been sent to me by some one far above him in position,\\nbut--”\\n\\n“But, doctor,” interposed the Countess, “you spoke to me of proofs, of\\nthreats, of certain mysterious persons.”\\n\\n“I simply repeated Daddy Tantaine’s words. The old idiot said to me,\\n‘Madame de Mussidan knows all about the fate of the Marquis, and this\\nis clearly proved by letters that she has received from him, as well as\\nfrom the Duke de Champdoce.’”\\n\\nThis time the arrow went home. She grew deadly pale, and started to her\\nfeet with her eyes dilated with horror.\\n\\n“My letters!” exclaimed she hoarsely.\\n\\nHortebise appeared utterly overwhelmed by this display of consternation,\\nof which he was the innocent cause.\\n\\n“Your letters, madame,” replied he with evident hesitation, “this\\ndouble-dyed scoundrel declares he has in his possession.”\\n\\nWith a cry like that of a wounded lioness, the Countess, taking no\\nnotice of the doctor’s presence, rushed from the room. Her rapid\\nfootfall could be heard on the stairs, and the rustle of her silken\\nskirts against the banisters. As soon as he was left alone, the doctor\\nrose from his seat with a cynical smile upon his face.\\n\\n“You may search,” mused he, “but you will find that the birds have\\nflown.” He walked up to one of the windows, and drummed on the glass\\nwith his fingers. “People say,” remarked he, “that Mascarin never\\nmakes a mistake. One cannot help admiring his diabolical sagacity and\\nunfailing logic. From the most trivial event he forges a long chain of\\nevidence, as the botanist is able, as he picks up a withered leaf, to\\ndescribe in detail the tree it came from. A pity, almost, that he did\\nnot turn his talents to some nobler end; but no; he is now upstairs\\nputting the Count on the rack, while I am inflicting tortures on the\\nCountess. What a shameful business we are carrying on! There are moments\\nwhen I think that I have paid dearly for my life of luxury, for I know\\nwell,” he added, half consciously fingering his locket, “that some day\\nwe shall meet some one stronger than ourselves, and then the inevitable\\nwill ensue.”\\n\\nThe reappearance of the Countess broke the chain of his thoughts. Her\\nhair was disturbed, her eyes had a wild look in them, and everything\\nabout her betrayed the state of agitation she was in.\\n\\n“Robbed! robbed!” cried she, as she entered the room. Her excitement was\\nso extreme that she spoke aloud, forgetting that the door was open,\\nand that the lackey in the ante-room could hear all she said. Luckily\\nHortebise did not lose his presence of mind, and, with the ease of a\\nleading actor repairing the error of a subordinate, he closed the door.\\n\\n“What have you lost?” asked he.\\n\\n“My letters; they are all gone.”\\n\\nShe staggered on to a couch, and in broken accents went on. “And yet\\nthese letters were in an iron casket closed by a secret spring; that\\ncasket was in a drawer, the key of which never leaves me.”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” exclaimed Hortebise in affected tones, “then Tantaine\\nspoke the truth.”\\n\\n“He did,” answered the Countess hoarsely. “Yes,” she continued, “I am\\nthe bondslave to people whose names I do not even know, who can control\\nmy every movement and action.”\\n\\nShe hid her face in her hands as though her pride sought to conceal her\\ndespair.\\n\\n“Are these letters, then, so terribly compromising?” asked the doctor.\\n\\n“I am utterly lost,” cried she. “In my younger days I had no experience;\\nI only thought of vengeance, and lately the weapons I forged myself\\nhave been turned against me. I dug a pitfall for my adversaries and have\\nfallen into it myself.”\\n\\nHortebise did not attempt to stay the torrent of her words, for the\\nCountess was in one of those moods of utter despair when the inner\\nfeelings of the soul are made manifest, as during a violent tempest the\\nweeds of ocean are hurled up to the surface of the troubled waters.\\n\\n“I would sooner be lying in my grave a thousand times,” wailed she,\\n“than see these letters in my husband’s hands. Poor Octave! have I not\\ncaused him sufficient annoyance already without this crowning sorrow?\\nWell, Dr. Hortebise, I am menaced with the production of these letters,\\nand they will be handed to my husband unless I agree to certain terms.\\nWhat are they? Of course money is required; tell me to what amount.”\\n\\nThe doctor shook his head.\\n\\n“Not money?” cried the Countess; “what, then, do they require? Speak,\\nand do not torture me more.”\\n\\nSometimes Hortebise confessed to Mascarin that, putting his interests on\\none side, he pitied his victims; but he showed no sign of this feeling,\\nand went on,--\\n\\n“The value of what they require, madame, is best estimated by yourself.”\\n\\n“Tell me what it is; I can bear anything now.”\\n\\n“These compromising letters will be placed in your hands upon the day on\\nwhich your daughter marries Henry de Croisenois, the brother of George.”\\n\\nMadame de Mussidan’s astonishment was so great that she stood as though\\npetrified into a statue.\\n\\n“I am commissioned to inform you, madame, that every delay necessary\\nfor altering any arrangements that may exist will be accorded you;\\nbut, remember, if your daughter marries any one else than Henry de\\nCroisenois, the letters will be at once placed in your husband’s hands.”\\n\\nAs he spoke the doctor watched her narrowly. The Countess crossed the\\nroom, faint and dizzy, and rested her head on the mantelpiece.\\n\\n“And that is all?” asked she. “What you ask me to do is utterly\\nimpossible: and perhaps it is for the best, for I shall have no long\\nagony of suspense to endure. Go, doctor, and tell the villain who holds\\nmy letters that he can take them to the Count at once.”\\n\\nThe Countess spoke in such a decided tone that Hortebise was a little\\npuzzled.\\n\\n“Can it be true,” she continued, “that scoundrels exist in our country\\nwho are viler than the most cowardly murderers,--men who trade in the\\nshameful secrets that they have learned, and batten upon the money\\nthey earn by their odious trade? I heard of such creatures before, but\\ndeclined to believe it; for I said to myself that such an idea only\\nexisted in the unhealthy imaginations of novel writers. It seems,\\nhowever that I was in error; but do not let these villains rejoice too\\nsoon; they will reap but a scanty harvest. There is one asylum left for\\nme where they cannot molest me.”\\n\\n“Ah, madame!” exclaimed the doctor in imploring accents; but she paid no\\nattention to his remonstrances, and went on with increasing violence,--\\n\\n“Do the miserable wretches think that I fear death? For years I\\nhave prayed for it as a final mercy from the heaven I have so deeply\\noffended. I long for the quiet of the sepulchre. You are surprised at\\nhearing one like me speak in this way,--one who has all her life been\\nadmired and flattered,--I, Diana de Laurebourg, Countess de Mussidan.\\nEven in the hours of my greatest triumphs my soul shuddered at the\\nthought of the grim spectre hidden away in the past; and I wished that\\ndeath would come and relieve my sufferings. My eccentricities have often\\nsurprised my friends, who asked if sometimes I were not a little mad.\\nMad? Yes, I am mad! They do not know that I seek oblivion in excitement,\\nand that I dare not be alone. But I have learned by this time that I\\nmust stifle the voice of conscience.”\\n\\nShe spoke like a woman utterly bereft of hope, who had resolved on the\\nfinal sacrifice. Her clear voice rang through the room, and Hortebise\\nturned pale as he heard the footsteps of the servants pacing to and fro\\noutside the door, as they made preparations for dinner.\\n\\n“All my life has been one continual struggle,” resumed she,--“a struggle\\nwhich has cost me sore; but now all is over, and to-night, for the first\\ntime for many years, Diana de Mussidan will sleep a calm and untroubled\\nsleep.”\\n\\nThe excitement of the Countess had risen to so high a pitch that the\\ndoctor asked himself how he could allay a tempest which he had not\\nforeseen; for her loud tones would certainly alarm the servants, who\\nwould hasten to acquaint the Count, who was himself stretched upon the\\nrack; then the entire plot would be laid bare, and all would be lost.\\n\\nMadame de Mussidan was about to rush from the room, when the doctor,\\nperceiving that he must act decisively, seized her by both wrists, and,\\nalmost by force, caused her to resume her seat.\\n\\n“In Heaven’s name, madame,” he whispered, “for your daughter’s sake,\\nlisten to me. Do not throw up all; am not I here ready to do your\\nbidding, whatever it may be? Rely upon me,--rely upon the knowledge of a\\nman of the world, and of one who still possesses some portion of what is\\ncalled a heart. Cannot we form an alliance to ward off this attack?”\\n\\nThe doctor continued in this strain, endeavoring to reassure the\\nCountess as much as he had previously endeavored to terrify her, and\\nsoon had the satisfaction of seeing his efforts crowned with success;\\nfor Madame de Mussidan listened to his flow of language, hardly\\ncomprehending its import, but feeling calmer as he went on; and in a\\nquarter of an hour he had persuaded her to look the situation boldly\\nin the face. Then Hortebise breathed more freely, and, wiping the\\nperspiration from his brow, felt that he had gained the victory.\\n\\n“It is a nefarious plot,” said the Countess.\\n\\n“So it is, madame; but the facts remain. Only tell me one thing, have\\nyou any special objection to M. de Croisenois paying his addresses to\\nyour daughter?”\\n\\n“Certainly not.”\\n\\n“He comes from a good family, is well educated, handsome, popular, and\\nonly thirty-four. If you remember, George was his senior by fifteen\\nyears. Why, then, is not the marriage a suitable one? Certainly, he has\\nled rather a fast life; but what young man is immaculate? They say\\nthat he is deeply in debt; but then your daughter has enough for both.\\nBesides, his brother left him a considerable fortune, not far short of\\ntwo millions, I believe; and to this, of course Henry will eventually\\nsucceed.”\\n\\nMadame de Mussidan was too overwhelmed by what she had already gone\\nthrough to offer any further exposition of her feelings on the subject.\\n\\n“All this is very well,” answered she; “but the Count has decided that\\nSabine is to become the wife of M. de Breulh-Faverlay, and I have no\\nvoice in the matter.”\\n\\n“But if you exert your influence?”\\n\\nThe Countess shook her head. “Once on a time,” said she sadly, “I\\nreigned supreme over Octave’s heart; I was the leading spirit of his\\nexistence. Then he loved me; but I was insensible to the depths of his\\naffection, and wore out a love that would have lasted as long as life\\nitself. Yes, in my folly I slew it, and now----” She paused for a moment\\nas if to collect her ideas, and then added more slowly: “and now our\\nlives are separate ones. I do not complain; it is all my own fault; he\\nis just and generous.”\\n\\n“But surely you can make the effort?”\\n\\n“But suppose Sabine loves M. de Breulh-Faverlay?”\\n\\n“But, madame, a mother can always influence her daughter.”\\n\\nThe Countess seized the doctor’s hand, and grasped it so tightly that he\\ncould hardly bear the pain.\\n\\n“I must,” said she in a hoarse whisper, “divulge to you the whole extent\\nof my unhappiness. I am estranged from my husband, and my daughter\\ndislikes and despises me. Some people think that life can be divided\\ninto two portions, one consecrated to pleasure and excitement, and the\\nother to domestic peace and happiness; but the idea is a false one. As\\nyouth has been, so will be age, either a reward or an expiation.”\\n\\nDr. Hortebise did not care to follow this train of argument--for the\\nCount might enter at any moment, or a servant might come in to announce\\ndinner--and only sought to soothe the excited feelings of Madame de\\nMussidan, and to prove to her that she was frightened by shadows, and\\nthat in reality she was not estranged from her husband, nor did her\\ndaughter dislike her; and finally a ray of hope illuminated the saddened\\nheart of the unfortunate lady.\\n\\n“Ah, doctor!” said she, “it is only misfortune that teaches us to know\\nour true friends.”\\n\\nThe Countess, like her husband, had now laid down her arms; she had made\\na longer fight of it, but in both cases the result had been the same.\\nShe promised that she would commence operations the next day, and do her\\nutmost to break off the present engagement.\\n\\nHortebise then took his leave, quite worn out with the severe conflict\\nhe had waged during his two hours’ interview with the Countess. In spite\\nof the extreme cold, the air outside seemed to refresh him considerably,\\nand he inhaled it with the happy feeling that he had performed his duty\\nin a manner worthy of all praise. He walked up the Rue de Faubourg Saint\\nHonore, and again entered the _café_ where he and his worthy confederate\\nhad agreed to meet. Mascarin was there, an untasted cutlet before him,\\nand his face hidden by a newspaper which his anxiety would not permit\\nhim to peruse. His suspense was terrible. Had Hortebise failed? had he\\nencountered one of those unforeseen obstacles which, like a minute grain\\nof sand, utterly hinders the working of a piece of delicate machinery?\\n\\n“Well, what news?” said he eagerly, as soon as he caught sight of the\\ndoctor.\\n\\n“Success, perfect success!” said Hortebise gayly. “But,” added he, as he\\nsank exhausted upon a seat, “the battle has been a hard one.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nIN THE STUDIO.\\n\\nStaggering like a drunken man, Paul Violaine descended the stairs\\nwhen his interview with Mascarin had been concluded. The sudden and\\nunexpected good fortune which had fallen so opportunely at his feet\\nhad for the moment absolutely stunned him. He was now removed from a\\nposition which had caused him to gaze with longing upon the still waters\\nof the Seine, to one of comparative affluence. “Mascarin,” said he to\\nhimself, “has offered me an appointment bringing in twelve thousand\\nfrancs per annum, and proposed to give me the first month’s salary in\\nadvance.”\\n\\nCertainly it was enough to bewilder any man, and Paul was utterly dazed.\\nHe went over all the events that had occurred during the day--the sudden\\nappearance of old Tantaine, with his loan of five hundred francs, and\\nthe strange man who knew the whole history of his life, and who, without\\nmaking any conditions, had offered him a valuable situation. Paul was\\nin no particular hurry to get back to the Hotel de Perou, for he said to\\nhimself that Rose could wait. A feeling of restlessness had seized\\nupon him. He wanted to squander money, and to have the sympathy of some\\ncompanions,--but where should he go, for he had no friends? Searching\\nthe records of his memory, he remembered that, when poverty had first\\novertaken him, he had borrowed twenty francs from a young fellow of his\\nown age, named Andre. Some gold coins still jingled in his pocket, and\\nhe could have a thousand francs for the asking. Would it not add to his\\nimportance if he were to go and pay this debt? Unluckily his creditor\\nlived a long distance off in the Rue de la Tour d’Auvergne. He, however,\\nhailed a passing cab, and was driven to Andre’s address. This young man\\nwas only a casual acquaintance, whom Paul had picked up one day in a\\nsmall wine-shop to which he used to take Rose when he first arrived\\nin Paris. Andre, with whose other name Paul was unacquainted, was an\\nartist, and, in addition, was an ornamental sculptor, and executed\\nthose wonderful decorations on the outside of houses in which builders\\ndelight. The trade is not a pleasant one, for it necessitates working\\nat dizzy heights, on scaffolds that vibrate with every footstep,\\nand exposes you to the heat of summer and the frosts of winter. The\\nbusiness, however, is well paid, and Andre got a good price for his\\nstone figures and wreaths. But all the money he earned went in the study\\nof the painter’s art, which was the secret desire of his soul. He\\nhad taken a studio, and twice his pictures had been exhibited at the\\n_Salon_, and orders began to come in. Many of his brother artists\\npredicted a glorious future for him. When the cab stopped, Paul threw\\nthe fare to the driver, and asked the clean-looking portress, who was\\npolishing the brasswork on the door, if M. Andre was at home.\\n\\n“He is, sir,” replied the old woman, adding, with much volubility, “and\\nyou are likely to find him in, for he has so much work; but he is such a\\ngood and quiet young man, and so regular in his habits! I don’t believe\\nhe owes a penny in the world; and as for drink, why he is a perfect\\nAnchorite. Then he has very few acquaintances,--one young lady, whose\\nface for a month past I have tried to see, but failed, because she wears\\na veil, comes to see him, accompanied by her maid.”\\n\\n“Good heavens, woman!” cried Paul impatiently, “will you tell me where\\nto find M. Andre?”\\n\\n“Fourth floor, first door to the right,” answered the portress, angry at\\nbeing interrupted; and as Paul ran up the stairs, she muttered, “A young\\nchap with no manners, taking the words out of a body’s mouth like that!\\nNext time he comes, I’ll serve him out somehow.”\\n\\nPaul found the door, with a card with the word “Andre” marked upon it\\nnailed up, and rapped on the panel. He heard the sound of a piece of\\nfurniture being moved, and the jingle of rings being passed along a rod;\\nthen a clear, youthful voice answered, “Come in!”\\n\\nPaul entered, and found himself in a large, airy room, lighted by a\\nskylight, and exquisitely clean and orderly. Sketches and drawings were\\nsuspended on the walls; there was a handsome carpet from Tunis, and\\na comfortable lounge; a mirror in a carved frame, which would have\\ngladdened the heart of a connoisseur, stood upon the mantelpiece. An\\neasel with a picture upon it, covered with a green baize curtain, stood\\nin one corner. The young painter was in the centre of his studio, brush\\nand palette in hand. He was a dark, handsome young man, well built and\\nproportioned, with close-cut hair, and a curling beard flowing down over\\nhis chest. His face was full of expression, and the energy and vigor\\nimprinted upon it formed a marked contrast to the appearance of\\nMascarin’s _protégé_. Paul noticed that he did not wear the usual\\npainter’s blouse, but was carefully dressed in the prevailing fashion.\\nAs soon as he recognized Paul, Andre came forward with extended hand.\\n“Ah,” said he, “I am pleased to see you, for I often wondered what had\\nbecome of you.”\\n\\nPaul was offended at this familiar greeting. “I have had many worries\\nand disappointments,” said he.\\n\\n“And Rose,” said Andre, “how is she--as pretty as ever, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” answered Paul negligently; “but you must forgive me for\\nhaving vanished so suddenly. I have come to repay your loan, with many\\nthanks.”\\n\\n“Pshaw!” returned the painter, “I never thought of the matter again;\\npray, do not inconvenience yourself.”\\n\\nAgain Paul felt annoyed, for he fancied that under the cloak of assumed\\ngenerosity the painter meant to humiliate him; and the opportunity of\\nairing his newly-found grandeur occurred to him.\\n\\n“It was a convenience to me, certainly,” said he, “but I am all right\\nnow, having a salary of twelve thousand francs.”\\n\\nHe thought that the artist would be dazzled, and that the mention of\\nthis sum would draw from him some exclamations of surprise and envy.\\nAndre, however, made no reply, and Paul was obliged to wind up with the\\nlame conclusion, “And at my age that is not so bad.”\\n\\n“I should call it superb. Should I be indiscreet in asking what you are\\ndoing?”\\n\\nThe question was a most natural one, but Paul could not reply to it,\\nas he was entirely ignorant as to what his employment was to be, and he\\nfelt as angry as if the painter had wantonly insulted him.\\n\\n“I work for it,” said he, drawing himself up with such a strange\\nexpression of voice and feature that Andre could not fail to notice it.\\n\\n“I work too,” remarked he; “I am never idle.”\\n\\n“But I have to work very hard,” returned Paul, “for I have not, like\\nyou, a friend or protector to interest himself in me.”\\n\\nPaul, who had not a particle of gratitude in his disposition, had\\nentirely forgotten Mascarin.\\n\\nThe artist was much amused by this speech. “And where do you think that\\na foundling, as I am, would find a protector?”\\n\\nPaul opened his eyes. “What,” said he, “are you one of those?”\\n\\n“I am; I make no secret of it, hoping that there is no occasion for me\\nto feel shame, though there may be for grief. All my friends know this;\\nand I am surprised that you are not aware that I am simply a foundling\\nfrom the Hopital de Vendome. Up to twelve years of age I was perfectly\\nhappy, and the master praised me for the knack I had of acquiring\\nknowledge. I used to work in the garden by day, and in the evening I\\nwasted reams of paper; for I had made up my mind to be an artist. But\\nnothing goes easily in this world, and one day the lady superintendent\\nconceived the idea of apprenticing me to a tanner.”\\n\\nPaul, who had taken a seat on the divan in order to listen, here\\ncommenced making a cigarette; but Andre stopped him. “Excuse me; but\\nwill you oblige me by not smoking?”\\n\\nPaul tossed the cigarette aside, though he was a little surprised,\\nas the painter was an inveterate smoker. “All right,” said he, “but\\ncontinue your story.”\\n\\n“I will; it is a long one. I hated the tanner’s business from the\\nvery beginning. Almost the first day an awkward workman scalded me so\\nseverely that the traces still remain.” As he spoke he rolled up his\\nshirt sleeve, and exhibited a scar that covered nearly all one side\\nof his arm. “Horrified at such a commencement, I entreated the lady\\nsuperintendent, a hideous old woman in spectacles, to apprentice me to\\nsome other trade, but she sternly refused. She had made up her mind that\\nI should be a tanner.”\\n\\n“That was very nasty of her,” remarked Paul.\\n\\n“It was, indeed; but from that day I made up my mind, and I determined\\nto run away as soon as I could get a little money together. I therefore\\nstuck steadily to the business, and by the end of the year, by means of\\nthe strictest economy, I found myself master of thirty francs. This, I\\nthought, would do, and, with a bundle containing a change of linen, I\\nstarted on foot for Paris. I was only thirteen, but I had been gifted by\\nProvidence with plenty of that strong will called by many obstinacy. I\\nhad made up my mind to be a painter.”\\n\\n“And you kept your vow?”\\n\\n“But with the greatest difficulty. Ah! I can close my eyes and see the\\nplace where I slept that first night I came to Paris. I was so exhausted\\nthat I did not awake for twelve hours. I ordered a good breakfast; and\\nfinding funds at a very low ebb, I started in search of work.”\\n\\nPaul smiled. He, too, remembered _his_ first day in Paris. He was\\ntwenty-two years of age, and had forty francs in his pocket.\\n\\n“I wanted to make money--for I felt I needed it--to enable me to pursue\\nmy studies. A stout man was seated near me at breakfast, and to him I\\naddressed myself.\\n\\n“‘Look here,’ said I, ‘I am thirteen, and much stronger than I look. I\\ncan read and write. Tell me how I can earn a living.’\\n\\n“He looked steadily at me, and in a rough voice answered, ‘Go to the\\nmarket to-morrow morning, and try if one of the master masons, who are\\non the lookout for hands, will employ you.’”\\n\\n“And you went?”\\n\\n“I did; and was eagerly watching the head masons, when I perceived my\\nstout friend coming toward me.\\n\\n“‘I like the looks of you, my lad,’ he said; ‘I am an ornamental\\nsculptor. Do you care to learn my trade?’\\n\\n“When I heard this proposal, it seemed as if Paradise was opening before\\nme, and I agreed with enthusiasm.”\\n\\n“And how about your painting?”\\n\\n“That came later on. I worked hard at it in all my hours of leisure. I\\nattended the evening schools, and worked steadily at my art and other\\nbranches of education. It was a very long time before I ventured to\\nindulge in a glass of beer. ‘No, no, Andre,’ I would say to myself,\\n‘beer costs six sous; lay the money by.’ Finally, when I was earning\\nfrom eighty to a hundred francs a week, I was able to give more time to\\nthe brush.”\\n\\nThe recital of this life of toil and self-denial, so different from his\\nown selfish and idle career, was inexpressibly mortifying to Paul; but\\nhe felt that he was called upon to say something.\\n\\n“When one has talents like yours,” said he, “success follows as a matter\\nof course.”\\n\\nHe rose to his feet, and affected to examine the sketches on the walls,\\nthough his attention was attracted to the covered picture on the easel.\\nHe remembered what the garrulous old portress had said about the veiled\\nlady who sometimes visited the painter, and that there had been some\\ndelay in admitting him when he first knocked. Then he considered, for\\nwhom had the painter dressed himself with such care? and why had he\\nrequested him not to smoke? From all these facts Paul came to the\\nconclusion that Andre was expecting the lady’s visit, and that the\\nveiled picture was her portrait. He therefore determined to see it;\\nand with this end in view, he walked round the studio, admiring all the\\npaintings on the walls, maneuvering in such a manner as to imperceptibly\\ndraw nearer to the easel.\\n\\n“And this,” said he, suddenly extending his hand toward the cover, “is,\\nI presume, the gem of your studio?”\\n\\nBut Andre was by no means dull, and had divined Paul’s intention,\\nand grasped the young man’s outstretched hand just as it touched the\\ncurtain.\\n\\n“If I veil this picture,” said he, “it is because I do not wish it to be\\nseen.”\\n\\n“Excuse me,” answered Paul, trying to pass over the matter as a jest,\\nthough in reality he was boiling over with rage at the manner and tone\\nof the painter, and considered his caution utterly ridiculous.\\n\\n“At any rate,” said he to himself, “I will lengthen out my visit, and\\nhave a glimpse of the original instead of her picture;” and, with this\\namiable resolution, he sat down by the artist’s table, and commenced an\\napparently interminable story, resolved not to attend to any hints his\\nfriend might throw out, who was glancing at the clock with the utmost\\nanxiety, comparing it every now and then with his watch.\\n\\nAs Paul talked on, he saw close to him on the table the photograph of a\\nyoung lady, and, taking advantage of the artist’s preoccupation, looked\\nat it.\\n\\n“Pretty, very pretty!” remarked he.\\n\\nAt these words the painter flushed crimson, and snatching away the\\nphotograph with some little degree of violence, thrust it between the\\nleaves of a book.\\n\\nAndre was so evidently in a patina, that Paul rose to his feet, and for\\na second or two the men looked into each other’s eyes as two adversaries\\ndo when about to engage in a mortal duel. They knew but little of\\neach other, and the same chance which had brought them together\\nmight separate them again at any moment, but each felt that the other\\nexercised some influence over his life.\\n\\nAndre was the first to recover himself.\\n\\n“You must excuse me; but I was wrong to leave so precious an article\\nabout.”\\n\\nPaul bowed with the air of a man who accepts an apology which he\\nconsiders his due; and Andre went on,--\\n\\n“I very rarely receive any one except my friends; but to-day I have\\nbroken through my rule.”\\n\\nPaul interrupted him with a magniloquent wave of the hand.\\n\\n“Believe me, sir,” said he, in a voice which he endeavoured to render\\ncutting and sarcastic, “had it not been for the imperative duty I before\\nalluded to, I should not have intruded.”\\n\\nAnd with these words he left the room, slamming the door behind him.\\n\\n“The deuce take the impudent fool!” muttered Andre. “I was strongly\\ntempted to pitch him out of the window.”\\n\\nPaul was in a furious rage for having visited the studio with the kindly\\ndesire of humiliating the painter. He could not but feel that the tables\\nhad been turned upon himself.\\n\\n“He shall not have it all his own way,” muttered he; “for I will see the\\nlady,” and not reflecting on the meanness of his conduct, he crossed the\\nstreet, and took up a position from which he could obtain a good view of\\nthe house where Andre resided. It was snowing; but Paul disregarded the\\ninclemency of the weather in his eagerness to act the spy.\\n\\nHe had waited for fully half an hour, when a cab drove up. Two women\\nalighted from it. The one was eminently aristocratic in appearance,\\nwhile the other looked like a respectable servant. Paul drew closer;\\nand, in spite of a thick veil, recognized the features he had seen in\\nthe photograph.\\n\\n“Ah!” said he, “after all, Rose is more to my taste, and I will get back\\nto her. We will pay up Loupins, and get out of his horrible den.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nMADEMOISELLE DE MUSSIDAN.\\n\\nPaul had not been the only watcher; for at the sound of the carriage\\nwheels the ancient portress took up her position in the doorway, with\\nher eyes fixed on the face of the young lady. When the two women had\\nascended the stairs, a sudden inspiration seized her, and she went out\\nand spoke to the cabman.\\n\\n“Nasty night,” remarked she; “I don’t envy you in such weather as this.”\\n\\n“You may well say that,” replied the driver; “my feet are like lumps of\\nice.”\\n\\n“Have you come far?”\\n\\n“Rather; I picked them up in the Champs Elysees, near the Avenue de\\nMatignon.”\\n\\n“That is a distance.”\\n\\n“Yes; and only five sous for drink money. Hang your respectable women!”\\n\\n“Oh! they are respectable, are they?”\\n\\n“I’ll answer for that. The other lot are far more open-handed. I know\\nboth of them.”\\n\\nAnd with these words and a knowing wink, he touched up his horse and\\ndrove away; and the portress, only half satisfied, went back to her\\nlodge.\\n\\n“Why that is the quarter where all the swells live,” murmured she. “I’ll\\ntip the maid next time, and she’ll let out everything.”\\n\\nAfter Paul’s departure, Andre could not remain quiet; for it appeared to\\nhim as if each second was a century. He had thrown open the door of his\\nstudio, and ran to the head of the stairs at every sound.\\n\\nAt last their footsteps really sounded on the steps. The sweetest music\\nin the world is the rustle of the beloved one’s dress. Leaning over the\\nbanisters, he gazed fondly down. Soon she appeared, and in a short time\\nhad gained the open door of the studio.\\n\\n“You see, Andre,” said she, extending her hand, “you see that I am true\\nto my time.”\\n\\nPale, and trembling with emotion, Andre pressed the little hand to his\\nlips.\\n\\n“Ah! Mademoiselle Sabine, how kind you are! Thanks, a thousand thanks.”\\n\\nYes, it was indeed Sabine, the scion of the lordly house of Mussidan,\\nwho had come to visit the poor foundling of the Hotel de Vendome in his\\nstudio, and who thus risked all that was most precious to her in\\nthe world, her honor and her reputation. Yes, regardless of the\\nconventionalities among which she had been reared, dared to cross that\\nsocial abyss which separates the Avenue de Matignon from the Rue de la\\nTour d’Auvergne. Cold reason finds no excuse for such a step, but the\\nheart can easily solve this seeming riddle. Sabine and Andre had been\\nlovers for more than two years. Their first acquaintance had commenced\\nat the Chateau de Mussidan. At the end of the summer of 1865, Andre,\\nwhose constant application to work had told upon his health, determined\\nto take a change, when his master, Jean Lanier, called him, and said,--\\n\\n“If you wish for a change, and at the same time to earn three or four\\nhundred francs, now is your time. An architect has written to me, asking\\nme for a skilled stone carver, to do some work in the country at a\\nmagnificent mansion in the midst of the most superb scenery. Would you\\ncare about undertaking this?”\\n\\nThe proposal was a most acceptable one to Andre, and in a week’s time he\\nwas on his way to his work with a prospect of living for a month in\\npure country air. Upon his arrival at the Chateau, he made a thorough\\nexamination of the work with which he had been entrusted. He saw that he\\ncould finish it with perfect ease, for it was only to restore the carved\\nwork on a balcony, which would not take more than a fortnight. He did\\nnot, however, press on the work, for the beautiful scenery enchanted\\nhim.\\n\\nHe made many exquisite sketches, and his health began to return to him.\\nBut there was another reason why he was in no haste to complete his\\ntask, one which he hardly ventured even to confess to himself: he had\\ncaught a glimpse of a young girl in the park of the Chateau who had\\ncaused a new feeling to spring up in his heart. It was Sabine de\\nMussidan. The Count, as the season came on, had gone to Germany, the\\nCountess had flitted away to Luzon, and the daughter was sent to the\\ndull old country mansion in charge of her old aunt. It was the old, old\\nstory; two young hearts loving with all the truth and energy of their\\nnatures. They had exchanged a few words on their first meeting, and on\\nthe next Sabine went on to the balcony and watched the rapid play of\\nAndre’s chisel with childish delight. For a long time they conversed,\\nand Sabine was surprised at the education and refinement of the young\\nworkman. Utterly fresh, and without experience, Sabine could not\\nunderstand her new sensations. Andre held, one night, a long converse\\nwith himself, and was at last obliged to confess that he loved her\\nfondly. He ran the extent of his folly and madness, and recognized the\\nbarrier of birth and wealth that stood between them, and was overwhelmed\\nwith consternation.\\n\\nThe Chateau of Mussidan stands in a very lonely spot, and one of the\\nroads leading to it passes through a dense forest, and therefore it had\\nbeen arranged that Andre was to take his meals in the house. After\\na time Sabine began to feel that this isolation was a needless\\nhumiliation.\\n\\n“Why can’t M. Andre take his meals with us?” asked she of her aunt. “He\\nis certainly more gentlemanlike than many of those who visit us, and I\\nthink that his conversation would entertain you.”\\n\\nThe old lady was easily persuaded to adopt this suggestion, though at\\nfirst it seemed an odd kind of thing to admit a mere working man to her\\ntable; but she was so bored with the loneliness of the place that she\\nhailed with delight anything that would break its monotony. Andre at\\nonce accepted the proposal, and the old lady would hardly believe her\\neyes when her guest entered the room with the dress and manners of a\\nhighbred gentleman. “It is hardly to be believed,” said she, as she was\\npreparing to go to bed, “that a mere carver of stone should be so like\\na gentleman. It seems to me that all distinctions of social rank have\\nvanished. It is time for me to die, or we are rapidly approaching a\\nstate of anarchy.”\\n\\nIn spite of her prejudices, however, Andre contrived to win the old\\nlady’s heart, and won a complete victory by painting her portrait in\\nfull gala costume. From that moment he was treated as one of the family,\\nand, having no fear of a rebuff, was witty and sprightly in his manner.\\nOnce he told the old lady the true story of his life. Sabine was deeply\\ninterested, and marvelled at his energy and endurance, which had won for\\nhim a place on the ladder that leads to future eminence. She saw in\\nhim the realization of all her girlish dreams, and finally confessed\\nto herself that she loved him. Both her father and mother had their own\\npleasures and pursuits, and Sabine was as much alone in the world as\\nAndre.\\n\\nThe days now fled rapidly by. Buried in this secluded country house,\\nthey were as free as the breeze that played through the trees of the\\nforest, for the old lady rarely disturbed them. After the morning meal,\\nshe would beg Andre to read the newspaper to her, and fell into a doze\\nbefore he had been five minutes at the task. Then the young people\\nwould slip quietly away, as merry as truants from school. They wandered\\nbeneath the shade of the giant oaks, or climbed the rocks that stood\\nby the river bank. Sometimes, seated in a dilapidated boat, they would\\ndrift down the stream with its flower-bedecked banks. The water was\\noften almost covered with rushes and water lilies. Two months of\\nenchantment thus fled past, two months of the intoxications of love,\\nthough the mention of the tender passion never rose to their lips\\nfrom their hearts, where it was deeply imbedded. Andre had cast all\\nreflections regarding the perils of the future to the winds, and only\\nthanked heaven for the happiness that he was experiencing.\\n\\n“Am I not too happy?” he would say to himself. “I fear this cannot\\nlast.” And he was right. Anxious to justify his remaining at Mussidan\\nafter his task was completed, Andre determined to add to what he had\\nalready done a masterpiece of modern art, by carving a garland of fruit\\nand flowers over the old balcony, and every morning he rose with the sun\\nto proceed with his task.\\n\\nOne morning the valet came to him, saying that the old lady was desirous\\nof seeing him, and begged him to lose no time, as the business was\\nurgent. A presentiment of evil came like a chilly blast upon the young\\nman’s heart. He felt that his brief dream of happiness was at an end,\\nand he followed the valet as a criminal follows his executioner to the\\nscaffold.\\n\\nAs he opened the door in which Sabine’s aunt was awaiting him, the old\\nman whispered,--\\n\\n“Have a care, sir, have a care. Madame is in a terrible state; I have\\nnot seen her like this since her husband died.”\\n\\nThe old lady was in a terrible state of excitement, and in spite of\\nrheumatic pains was walking up and down the room, gesticulating wildly,\\nand striking her crutch-handled stick on the floor.\\n\\n“And so,” cried she in that haughty tone adopted by women of\\naristocratic lineage when addressing a supposed inferior, “you have, I\\nhear, had the impudence to make love to my niece?”\\n\\nAndre’s pale face grew crimson as he stammered out,--\\n\\n“Madame--”\\n\\n“Gracious powers, fellow!” cried the angry woman, “do you dare to\\ndeny this when your very face betrays you? Do you know that you are an\\ninsolent rogue even to venture to look on Sabine de Mussidan? How dare\\nyou! Perhaps you thought that if you compromised her, we should be\\nforced to submit to this ignoble alliance.”\\n\\n“On my honor, madame, I assure you--”\\n\\n“On your honor! To hear you speak, one would suppose that you were a\\ngentleman. If my poor husband were alive, he would break every bone in\\nyour body; but I am satisfied with ordering you out of the house. Pick\\nup your tools, and be off at once.”\\n\\nAndre stood as though petrified into stone. He took no notice of her\\nimperious manner, but only realized the fact that he should never see\\nSabine again, and, turning deadly pale, staggered to a chair. The\\nold lady was so surprised at the manner in which Andre received her\\ncommunication, that for a time she too was bewildered, and could not\\nutter a word.\\n\\n“I am unfortunately of a violent temper,” said she, speaking in more\\ngentle accents, “and perhaps I have spoken too severely, for I am much\\nto blame in this matter, as the priest of Berron said when he came to\\ninform me of what was going on. I am so old that I forgot what happens\\nwhen young people are thrown together, and I was the only one who did\\nnot know what was going on when you were affording subject of gossip for\\nthe whole countryside; my niece--”\\n\\nBut here Andre started to his feet with a threatening look upon his\\nface.\\n\\n“I could strangle them all,” cried he.\\n\\n“That is right,” returned the old lady, secretly pleased at his vigor\\nand energy, “but you cannot silence every idle tongue. Fortunately,\\nmatters have not gone too far. Go away, and forget my niece.”\\n\\nShe might as well have told the young man to go away and die.\\n\\n“Madame!” cried he in accents of despair, “pray listen to me. I am\\nyoung, and full of hope and courage.”\\n\\nThe old lady was so touched by his evident sorrow, that the tears rolled\\ndown her wrinkled cheeks.\\n\\n“What is the good of saying this to me?” asked she. “Sabine is not my\\ndaughter. All that I can do is never to say a word to her father and\\nmother. Great heavens, if Mussidan should ever learn what has occurred!\\nThere, do go away. You have upset me so that I do not believe I shall\\neat a mouthful for the next two days.”\\n\\nAndre staggered out of the room. It seemed to him as if the flooring\\nheaved and rolled beneath his feet. He could see nothing, but he felt\\nsome one take him by the hand. It was Sabine, pallid and cold as a\\nmarble statue.\\n\\n“I have heard everything, Andre,” murmured she.\\n\\n“Yes,” stammered he. “All is over, and I am dismissed.”\\n\\n“Where are you going to?”\\n\\n“Heaven only knows, and when once I leave this place I care not.”\\n\\n“Do not be desperate,” urged Sabine, laying her hand upon his arm.\\n\\nHis fixed glance terrified her as he muttered,--\\n\\n“I cannot help it; I am driven to despair.”\\n\\nNever had Sabine appeared so lovely; her eyes gleamed with some generous\\nimpulse, and her face glowed.\\n\\n“Suppose,” said she, “I could give you a ray of future hope, what would\\nyou do then?”\\n\\n“What would I _not_ do then? All that a man could. I would fight my way\\nthrough all opposition. Give me the hardest task, and I will fulfil it.\\nIf money is wanted, I will gain it; if a name, I will win it.”\\n\\n“There is one thing that you have forgotten, and that is patience.”\\n\\n“And that, Mademoiselle, I possess also. Do you not understand that with\\none word of hope from you I can live on?”\\n\\nSabine raised her head heavenwards. “Work!” she exclaimed. “Work and\\nhope, for I swear that I will never wed other than you.”\\n\\nHere the voice of the old lady interrupted the lovers.\\n\\n“Still lingering here!” she cried, in a voice like a trumpet call. Andre\\nfled away with hope in his heart, and felt that he had now something\\nto live for. No one knew exactly what happened after his departure. No\\ndoubt Sabine brought round her aunt to her way of thinking, for at her\\ndeath, which happened two months afterward, she left the whole of her\\nimmense fortune directly to her niece, giving her the income while\\nshe remained single, and the capital on her marriage, whether with or\\nwithout the consent of her parents. Madame de Mussidan declared that\\nthe old lady had gone crazy, but both Andre and Sabine knew what she had\\nintended, and sincerely mourned for the excellent woman, whose last act\\nhad been to smooth away the difficulties from their path. Andre worked\\nharder than ever, and Sabine encouraged him by fresh promises. Sabine\\nwas even more free in Paris than at Mussidan, and her attached maid,\\nModeste, would have committed almost any crime to promote the happiness\\nof her beloved mistress. The lovers now corresponded regularly, and\\nSabine, accompanied by Modeste, frequently visited the artist’s studio,\\nand never was a saint treated with greater respect and adoration than\\nwas Sabine by Andre.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nROSE’S PROMOTION.\\n\\nAs soon as Andre had released her hand, Sabine took off her hat, and,\\nhanding it to Modeste, remarked,--\\n\\n“How am I looking to-day, Andre?”\\n\\nThe young painter hastened to reassure her on this point, and she\\ncontinued in joyous tones,--\\n\\n“No, I do not want compliments; I want to know if I look the right thing\\nfor sitting for my portrait.”\\n\\nSabine was very beautiful, but hers was a different style of beauty from\\nthat of Rose, whose ripe, sensuous charms were fitted to captivate the\\nadmiration of the voluptuary, while Sabine was of the most refined and\\nethereal character. Rose fettered the body with earthly trammels, while\\nSabine drew the soul heavenward. Her beauty was not of the kind that\\ndazzles, for the air of proud reserve which she threw over it, in some\\nslight measure obscured its brilliancy.\\n\\nShe might have passed unnoticed, like the work of a great master’s brush\\nhanging neglected over the altar of a village church; but when the eye\\nhad once fathomed that hidden beauty, it never ceased to gaze on it with\\nadmiration. She had a broad forehead, covered with a wealth of chestnut\\nhair, soft, lustrous eyes, and an exquisitely chiselled mouth.\\n\\n“Alas!” said Andre, “when I gaze upon you, I have to confess how\\nimpossible it is to do you justice. Before you came I had fancied\\nthat the portrait was completed, but now I see that I have only made a\\nfailure.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, he drew aside the curtain, and the young girl’s portrait\\nwas revealed. It was by no means a work of extraordinary merit. The\\nartist was only twenty-four years of age, and had been compelled to\\ninterrupt his studies to toil for his daily bread, but it was full of\\noriginality and genius. Sabine gazed at it for a few moments in silence,\\nand then murmured the words,--\\n\\n“It is lovely!”\\n\\nBut Andre was too discouraged to notice her praise.\\n\\n“It is like,” remarked he, “but a photograph also has that merit. I have\\nonly got your features, but not your expression; it is an utter failure.\\nShall I try again?”\\n\\nSabine stopped him with a gesture of denial.\\n\\n“You shall not try again,” said she decidedly.\\n\\n“And why not?” asked he in astonishment.\\n\\n“Because this visit will be my last, Andre.”\\n\\n“The last?” stammered the painter. “In what way have I so offended you,\\nthat you should inflict so terrible a punishment on me?”\\n\\n“I do not wish to punish you. You asked for my portrait, and I yielded\\nto your request; but let us talk reasonably. Do you not know that I am\\nrisking my reputation by coming here day after day?”\\n\\nAndre made no reply, for this unexpected blow had almost stunned him.\\n\\n“Besides,” continued Mademoiselle de Mussidan, “what is to be done with\\nthe portrait? It must be hidden away, as if it were something we were\\nashamed of. Remember, on your success hangs our marriage.”\\n\\n“I do not forget that.”\\n\\n“Hasten then to gain all honor and distinction, for the world must agree\\nwith me in saying that my choice has been a wise one.”\\n\\n“I will do so.”\\n\\n“I fully believe you, dear Andre, and remember what I said to you a year\\nago. Achieve a name, then go to my father and ask for my hand. If he\\nrefuses, if my supplications do not move him, I will quit his roof\\nforever.”\\n\\n“You are right,” answered Andre. “I should indeed by a fool if I\\nsacrificed a future happy life for a few hours of present enjoyment, and\\nI will implicitly--”\\n\\n“And now,” said Sabine, “that we have agreed on this point, let us\\ndiscuss our mutual interests, of which it seems that we have been a\\nlittle negligent up till now.”\\n\\nAndre at once began to tell her of all that had befallen him since they\\nhad last met, his defeats and successes.\\n\\n“I am in an awkward plight,” said he. “Yesterday, that well known\\ncollector, Prince Crescenzi, came to my studio. One of my pictures took\\nhis fancy, and he ordered another from me, for which he would pay six\\nthousand francs.”\\n\\n“That was quite a stroke of luck.”\\n\\n“Just so, but unfortunately he wants it directly. Then Jean Lamou, who\\nhas more in his hand than he can manage, has offered me the decoration\\nof a palatial edifice that he is building for a great speculator, M.\\nGandelu. I am to engage all the workmen, and shall receive some seven or\\neight hundred francs a month.”\\n\\n“But how does this trouble you?”\\n\\n“I will tell you. I have twice seen M. Gandelu, and he wants me to begin\\nwork at once; but I cannot accept both, and must choose between them.”\\n\\nSabine reflected.\\n\\n“I should execute the Prince’s commission,” said she.\\n\\n“So should I, only----”\\n\\nThe girl easily found the cause of his hesitation.\\n\\n“Will you never forget that I am wealthy?” replied she.\\n\\n“The one would bring in the most money,” he returned, “and the other\\nmost credit.”\\n\\n“Then accept the offer of M. Gandelu.”\\n\\nThe old cuckoo-clock in the corner struck five.\\n\\n“Before we part, dear Andre,” resumed she, “I must tell you of a fresh\\ntrouble which threatens us; there is a project for marrying me to M. de\\nBreulh-Faverlay.”\\n\\n“What, that very wealthy gentleman?”\\n\\n“Just so.”\\n\\n“Well, if I oppose my father’s wishes, an explanation must ensue, and\\nthis just now I do not desire. I therefore intend to speak openly to M.\\nde Breulh-Faverlay, who is an honorable, straightforward man; and when I\\ntell him the real state of the case, he will withdraw his pretensions.”\\n\\n“But,” replied Andre, “should he do so, another will come forward.”\\n\\n“That is very possible, and in his turn the successor will be\\ndismissed.”\\n\\n“Ah!” murmured the unhappy man, “how terrible will be your life,--a\\nscene of daily strife with your father and mother.”\\n\\nAfter a tender farewell, Sabine and Modeste left. Andre had wished to\\nbe permitted to go out and procure a vehicle, but this the young girl\\nnegatived, and took her leave, saying.--\\n\\n“I shall see M. de Breulh-Faverlay to-morrow.”\\n\\nFor a moment after he was left alone Andre felt very sad, but a happy\\nthought flashed across his brain.\\n\\n“Sabine,” said he, “went away on foot, and I may follow her without\\ninjury to her reputation.”\\n\\nIn another moment he was in the street, and caught a glimpse of Sabine\\nand her maid under a lamp at the next corner. He crossed to the other\\nside of the way and followed them cautiously.\\n\\n“Perhaps,” murmured he, “the time is not far distant when I shall have\\nthe right to be with her in her walks, and feel her arm pressed against\\nmine.”\\n\\nBy this time Sabine and her companion had reached the Rue Blanche, and\\nhailing a cab, were rapidly driven away. Andre gazed after it, and as\\nsoon as it was out of sight, decided to return to his work. As he passed\\na brilliantly lighted shop, a fresh young voice saluted him.\\n\\n“M. Andre, M. Andre.”\\n\\nHe looked up in extreme surprise, and saw a young woman, dressed in\\nthe most extravagant style, standing by the door of a brougham, which\\nglittered with fresh paint and varnish. In vain he tried to think who\\nshe could be, but at length his memory served him.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Rose,” said he, “or I am much mistaken.”\\n\\nA shrill, squeaky voice replied, “Madame Zora Chantemille, if you\\nplease.”\\n\\nAndre turned sharply round and found himself face to face with a young\\nman who had completed an order he was giving to the coachman.\\n\\n“Ah, is that you?” said he.\\n\\n“Yes, Chantemille is the name of the estate that I intend to settle on\\nmadame.”\\n\\nThe painter examined the personage who had just addressed him with\\nmuch curiosity. He was dressed in the height or rather the burlesque of\\nfashion, wore an eyeglass, and an enormous locket on his chain. The face\\nwhich surmounted all this grandeur was almost that of a monkey, and\\nToto Chupin had not exaggerated its ugliness when he likened it to that\\nanimal.\\n\\n“Pooh,” cried Rose, “what matters a name? All you have to do is to ask\\nthis gentleman, who is an old friend of mine, to dinner.” And without\\nwaiting for a reply, she took Andre by the hand and led him into a\\nbrilliantly lighted hall. “You must dine with us,” she exclaimed; “I\\nwill take no denial. Come, let me introduce you, M. Andre, M. Gaston de\\nGandelu. There, that is all settled.”\\n\\nThe man bowed.\\n\\n“Andre, Andre,” repeated Gandelu; “why, the name is familiar to me,--and\\nso is the face. Have I not met you at my father’s house? Come in; we\\nintend to have a jovial evening.”\\n\\n“I really cannot,” pleaded Andre. “I have an engagement.”\\n\\n“Throw it over then; we intend to keep you, now that we have got you.”\\n\\nAndre hesitated for a moment, but he felt dispirited, and that he\\nrequired rousing. “After all,” thought he, “why should I refuse? If this\\nyoung man’s friends are like himself, the evening will be an amusing\\none.”\\n\\n“Come up,” cried Rose, placing her foot upon the stairs. Andre was about\\nto follow her, but was held back by Gandelu, whose face was radiant with\\ndelight.\\n\\n“Was there ever such a girl?” whispered he; “but there, don’t jump at\\nconclusions. I have only had her in hand for a short time, but I am a\\nreal dab at starting a woman grandly, and it would be hard to find my\\nequal in Paris, you may bet.”\\n\\n“That can be seen at a glance,” answered Andre, concealing a smile.\\n\\n“Well, look here, I began at once. Zora is a quaint name, is it not?\\nIt was my invention. She isn’t a right down swell to-day, but I have\\nordered six dresses for her from Van Klopen; such swell gets up! You\\nknow Van Klopen, don’t you, the best man-milliner in Paris. Such taste!\\nsuch ideas! you never saw the like.”\\n\\nRose had by this time reached her drawing-room. “Andre,” said she,\\nimpatiently, “are you never coming up?”\\n\\n“Quick, quick,” said Gandelu, “let us go at once; if she gets into a\\ntemper she is sure to have a nervous attack, so let us hurry up.”\\n\\nRose did all she could to dazzle Andre, and as a commencement exhibited\\nto him her domestics, a cook and a maid; then he was shown every article\\nof furniture, and not one was spared him. He was forced to admire the\\ndrawing-room suite covered with old gold silk, trimmed blue, and to test\\nthe thickness of the curtains. Bearing aloft a large candelabra, and\\ncovering himself with wax, Gandelu led the way, telling them the price\\nof everything like an energetic tradesman.\\n\\n“That clock,” said he, “cost me a hundred louis, and dirt cheap at the\\nprice. How funny that you should have known my father! Has he not\\na wonderful intellect? That flower stand was three hundred francs,\\nabsolutely given away. Take care of the governor, he is as sharp as a\\nneedle. He wanted me to have a profession, but no, thank you. Yes, that\\noccasional table was a bargain at twenty louis. Six months ago I thought\\nthat the old man would have dropped off, but now the doctors say--” He\\nstopped suddenly, for a loud noise was heard in the vestibule. “Here\\ncome the fellows I invited,” cried he, and placing the candelabra on the\\ntable, he hurried from the room.\\n\\nAndre was delighted at so grand an opportunity of studying the _genus_\\nmasher. Rose felt flattered by the admiration her fine rooms evidently\\ncaused.\\n\\n“You see,” cried she, “I have left Paul; he bothered me awfully, and\\nended by half starving me.”\\n\\n“Why, you are joking; he came here to-day, and said he was earning\\ntwelve thousand francs a year.”\\n\\n“Twelve thousand humbugs. A fellow that will take five hundred francs\\nfrom an old scarecrow he never met before is--”\\n\\nRose broke off abruptly, for at that moment young Gandelu brought in his\\nfriends, and introduced them; they were all of the same type as\\ntheir host, and Andre was about to study them more intently, when a\\nwhite-waistcoated waiter threw open the door, exclaiming pompously,\\n“Madame, the dinner is on the table.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\n“YOU ARE A THIEF.”\\n\\nWhen Mascarin was asked what was the best way to achieve certain\\nresults, his invariable reply was, “Keep moving, keep moving.” He had\\none great advantage over other men, he put in practice the doctrines he\\npreached, and at seven o’clock the morning after his interview with the\\nCount de Mussidan he was hard at work in his room. A thick fog hung over\\nthe city, even penetrating into the office, which had begun to fill\\nwith clients. This crowd had but little interest for the head of the\\nestablishment, as it consisted chiefly of waiters from small eating\\nhouses, and cooks who knew little or nothing of what was going on in the\\nhouses where they were in service. Finding this to be the case, Mascarin\\nhanded them all over to Beaumarchef, and only occasionally nodded to the\\nserviteur of some great family, who chanced to stroll in.\\n\\nHe was busily engaged in arranging those pieces of cardboard which had\\nso much puzzled Paul in his first visit, and was so much occupied with\\nhis task, that all he could do was to mutter broken exclamations: “What\\na stupendous undertaking! but I have to work single-handed, and hold in\\nmy hands all these threads, which for twenty years, with the patience of\\na spider, I have been weaving into a web. No one, seeing me here,\\nwould believe this. People who pass me by in the street say, ‘That is\\nMascarin, who keeps a servants’ registry office;’ that is the way in\\nwhich they look upon me. Let them laugh if they like; they little know\\nthe mighty power I wield in secret. No one suspects me, no, not one. I\\nmay seem too sanguine, it is true,” he continued, still glancing over\\nhis papers, “or the net may break and some of the fishes slip out. That\\nidiot, Mussidan, asked me if I was acquainted with the Penal code. I\\nshould think I was, for no one has studied them more deeply than I have,\\nand there is a clause in volume 3, chapter 2, which is always before me.\\nPenal servitude for a term of years; and if I am convicted under Article\\n306, then it means a life sentence.” He shuddered, but soon a smile of\\ntriumph shone over his face as he resumed, “Ah, but to send a man like\\nMascarin for change of air to Toulon, he must be caught, and that is not\\nsuch an easy task. The day he scents danger he disappears, and leaves\\nno trace behind him. I fear that I cannot look for too much from my\\ncompanions, Catenac and Hortebise; I have up to now kept them back.\\nCroisenois would never betray me, and as for Beaumarchef, La Candele,\\nToto Chupin, and a few other poor devils, they would be a fine haul\\nfor the police. They couldn’t split, simply because they know nothing.”\\n Mascarin chuckled, and then adjusting his spectacles with his favorite\\ngesture, said, “I shall go on in the course I have commenced, straight\\nas the flight of an arrow. I ought to make four millions through\\nCroisenois. Paul shall marry Flavia, that is all arranged, and Flavia\\nwill make a grand duchess with her magnificent income.”\\n\\nHe had by this time arranged his pasteboard squares, then he took a\\nsmall notebook, alphabetically arranged, from a drawer, wrote a name\\nor two in it, and then closing it said with a deadly smile, “There, my\\nfriends, you are all registered, though you little suspect it. You are\\nall rich, and think that you are free, but you are wrong, for there is\\none man who owns you, soul and body, and that man is Baptiste Mascarin;\\nand at his bidding, high as you hold your heads now, you will crawl to\\nhis feet in humble abasement.” His musings were interrupted by a knock\\nat the door. He struck the bell on his writing table, and the last sound\\nof it was hardly died away, when Beaumarchef stood on the threshold.\\n\\n“You desired me, sir,” said he, with the utmost deference, “to complete\\nmy report regarding young M. Gandelu, and it so happens that the cook\\nwhom he has taken into his service in the new establishment he has\\nstarted is on our list. She has just come in to pay us eleven francs\\nthat she owed us, and is waiting outside. Is not this lucky?”\\n\\nMascarin made a little grimace. “You are an idiot, Beaumarchef,” said\\nhe, “to be pleased at so trivial a matter. I have often told you that\\nthere is no such thing as luck or chance, and that all comes to those\\nwho work methodically.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef listened to his master’s wisdom in silent surprise.\\n\\n“And pray, who is this woman?” asked Mascarin.\\n\\n“You will know her when you see her, sir. She is registered under class\\nD, that is, for employment in rather fast establishments.”\\n\\n“Go and fetch her,” observed Mascarin, and as the man left the room, he\\nmuttered, “Experience has taught me that it is madness to neglect the\\nsmallest precaution.”\\n\\nIn another moment the woman appeared, and Mascarin at once addressed her\\nwith that air of friendly courtesy which made him so popular among such\\nwomen. “Well, my good girl,” said he, “and so you have got the sort of\\nplace you wanted, eh?”\\n\\n“I hope so, sir, but you see I have only been with Madame Zora de\\nChantemille since yesterday.”\\n\\n“Ah, Zora de Chantemille, that is a fine name, indeed.”\\n\\n“It is only a fancy name, and she had an awful row over it with master.\\nShe wanted to be called Raphaela, but he stood out for Zora.”\\n\\n“Zora is a very pretty name,” observed Mascarin solemnly.\\n\\n“Yes, sir, just what the maid and I told her. She is a splendid woman,\\nand doesn’t she just squander the shiners? Thirty thousand francs have\\ngone since yesterday.”\\n\\n“I can hardly credit it.”\\n\\n“Not cash, you understand, but tick. M. de Gandelu has not a sou of his\\nown in the world, so a waiter at Potier’s told me, and he knew what\\nwas what; but the governor is rolling in money. Yesterday they had a\\nhouse-warming--the dinner, with wine, cost over a thousand francs.”\\n\\nNot seeing how to utilize any of this gossip, Mascarin made a gesture of\\ndismissal, when the woman exclaimed,--\\n\\n“Stop, sir, I have something to tell you.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Mascarin, throwing himself back in his chair with an air of\\naffected impatience, “let us have it.”\\n\\n“We had eight gents to dinner, all howling swells, but my master was the\\nbiggest masher of the lot. Madame was the only woman at table. Well, by\\nten o’clock, they had all had their whack of drink, and then they told\\nthe porter to keep the courtyard clear. What do you think they did then?\\nWhy, they threw plates, glasses, knives, forks, and dishes bang out of\\nthe window. That is a regular swell fashion, so the waiter at Potier’s\\ntold me, and was introduced into Paris by a Russian.”\\n\\nMascarin closed his eyes and answered languidly, “Go on.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, there was one gent who was a blot on the whole affair. He\\nwas tall, shabbily dressed, and with no manners at all. He seemed all\\nthe time to be sneering at the rest. But didn’t Madame make up to him\\njust. She kept heaping up his plate and filling his glass. When the\\nothers got to cards, he sat down by my mistress, and began to talk.”\\n\\n“Could you hear what they said?”\\n\\n“I should think so. I was in the bedroom, and they were near the door.”\\n\\n“Dear me,” remarked Mascarin, appearing much shocked, “surely that was\\nnot right?”\\n\\n“I don’t care a rap whether it was right or not. I like to hear all\\nabout the people whom I engage with. They were talking about a M. Paul,\\nwho had been Madame’s friend before, and whom the gentleman also knew.\\nMadame said that this Paul was no great shakes, and that he had stolen\\ntwelve thousand francs.”\\n\\nMascarin pricked up his ears, feeling that his patience was about to\\nmeet its reward.\\n\\n“Can you tell me the gentleman’s name, to whom Madame said all this?”\\n asked he.\\n\\n“Not I. The others called him ‘The painter.’”\\n\\nThis explanation did not satisfy Mascarin.\\n\\n“Look here, my good girl,” said he, “try and find out the fellow’s name.\\nI think he is an artist who owes me money.”\\n\\n“All right! Rely on me; and now I must be off, for I have breakfast to\\nget ready, but I’ll call again to-morrow;” and with a curtsy she left\\nthe room.\\n\\nMascarin struck his hand heavily on the table.\\n\\n“Hortebise has a wonderful nose for sniffing out danger,” said he. “This\\nRose and the young fool who is ruining himself for her must both be\\nsuppressed.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef again made a motion of executing a thrust with the rapier.\\n\\n“Pooh, pooh!” answered his master; “don’t be childish. I can do better\\nthan that. Rose calls herself nineteen, but she is more, she is of age,\\nwhile Gandelu is still a minor. If old Gandelu had any pluck, he would\\nput Article 354 in motion.”\\n\\n“Eh, sir?” said Beaumarchef, much mystified.\\n\\n“Look here. Before twenty-four hours have elapsed I must know everything\\nas to the habits and disposition of Gandelu senior. I want to know on\\nwhat terms he is with his son.”\\n\\n“Good. I will set La Candele to work.”\\n\\n“And as the young fellow will doubtless need money, contrive to let him\\nknow of our friend Verminet, the chairman of the Mutual Loan Society.”\\n\\n“But that is M. Tantaine’s business.”\\n\\nMascarin paid no heed to this, so occupied was he by his own thoughts.\\n\\n“This young artist seems to have more brains than the rest of the set,\\nbut woe to him if he crosses my path. Go back to the outer office,\\nBeaumarchef, I hear some clients coming in.”\\n\\nThe man, however, did not obey.\\n\\n“Pardon me, sir,” said he, “but La Candele, who is outside, will see\\nthem. I have my report to make.”\\n\\n“Very good. Sit down and go on.”\\n\\nEnchanted at this mark of condescension, Beaumarchef went on. “Yesterday\\nthere was nothing of importance, but this morning Toto Chupin came.”\\n\\n“He had not lost Caroline Schimmel, I trust?”\\n\\n“No, sir; he had even got into conversation with her.”\\n\\n“That is good. He is a cunning little devil; a pity that he is not a\\ntrifle more honest.”\\n\\n“He is sure,” continued Beaumarchef, “that the woman drinks, for she is\\nalways talking of persons following her about who menace her, and she is\\nso afraid of being murdered that she never ventures out alone. She lives\\nwith a respectable workingman and his wife, and pays well for her board,\\nfor she seems to have plenty of money.”\\n\\n“That is a nuisance,” remarked Mascarin, evidently much annoyed. “Where\\ndoes she live?”\\n\\n“At Montmartre, beyond the Chateau Rouge.”\\n\\n“Good. Tantaine will inquire and see if Toto has made no mistake, and\\ndoes not let the woman slip through his fingers.”\\n\\n“He won’t do that, for he told me that he was on the right road to find\\nout who she was, and where she got her money from. But I ought to warn\\nyou against the young scamp, for I have found out that he robs us and\\nsells our goods far below their value.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“I have long had my suspicions, and yesterday I wormed it all out from\\na disreputable looking fellow, who came here to ask for his friend\\nChupin.”\\n\\nMen accustomed to danger are over prompt in their decisions. “Very\\nwell,” returned Mascarin, “if this is the case, Master Chupin shall have\\na taste of prison fare.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef withdrew, but almost immediately reappeared.\\n\\n“Sir,” said he, “a servant from M. de Croisenois is here with a note.”\\n\\n“Send the man in,” said Mascarin.\\n\\nThe domestic was irreproachably dressed, and looked what he was, the\\nservant of a nobleman.\\n\\nHe had something the appearance of an Englishman, with a high collar,\\nreaching almost to his ears. His face was clean shaved, and of a\\nruddy hue. His coat was evidently the work of a London tailor, and his\\nappearance was as stiff as though carved out of wood. Indeed, he looked\\nlike a very perfect piece of mechanism.\\n\\n“My master,” said he, “desired me to give this note into your own\\nhands.”\\n\\nUnder cover of breaking the seal, Mascarin viewed this model servant\\nattentively. He was a stranger to him, for he had never supplied\\nCroisenois with a domestic.\\n\\n“It seems, my good fellow,” said he, “that your master was up earlier\\nthan usual this morning?”\\n\\nThe man frowned a little at this familiar address, and then slowly\\nreplied,--\\n\\n“When I took service with the Marquis, he agreed to give me fifteen\\nlouis over my wages for the privilege of calling me ‘a good fellow,’\\nbut I permit no one to do so gratis. I think that my master is still\\nasleep,” continued the man solemnly. “He wrote the note on his return\\nfrom the club.”\\n\\n“Is there any reply.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“Good; then wait a little.”\\n\\nAnd Mascarin, opening the note, read the following:\\n\\n“MY DEAR FRIEND,--\\n\\n“Baccarat has served me an ugly turn, and in addition to all my ready\\ncash I have given an I.O.U. for three thousand francs. To save my credit\\nI must have this by twelve to-morrow.”\\n\\n“His credit,” said Mascarin. “His credit! That is a fine joke indeed.”\\n The servant stood up stiffly erect, as one seeming to take no notice,\\nand the agent continued reading the letter.\\n\\n“Am I wrong in looking to you for this trifle? I do not think so.\\nIndeed, I have an idea that you will send me a hundred and fifty louis\\nover and above, so that I may not be left without a coin in my pocket.\\nHow goes the great affair? I await your decision on the brink of a\\nprecipice.\\n\\n“Yours devotedly,\\n\\n“HENRY DE CROISENOIS.”\\n\\n\\n“And so,” growled Mascarin, “he has flung away five thousand francs,\\nand asks me to find it for him in my coffers. Ah, you fool, if I did not\\nwant the grand name that you have inherited from your ancestors, a\\nname that you daily bespatter and soil, you might whistle for your five\\nthousand francs.”\\n\\nHowever, as Croisenois was absolutely necessary to him, Mascarin slowly\\ntook from his safe five notes of a thousand francs each, and handed them\\nto the man.\\n\\n“Do you want a receipt?” asked the man.\\n\\n“No; this letter is sufficient, but wait a bit;” and Mascarin, with\\nan eye to the future, drew a twenty franc piece from his pocket, and\\nplacing it on the table, said in his most honeyed accents,--\\n\\n“There, my friend, is something for yourself.”\\n\\n“No, sir,” returned the man; “I always ask wages enough to prevent the\\nnecessity of accepting presents.” And with this dignified reply he bowed\\nwith the stiff air of a Quaker, and walked rigidly out of the room.\\n\\nThe agent was absolutely thunderstruck. In all his thirty years’\\nexperience he had never come across anything like this.\\n\\n“I can hardly believe my senses,” muttered he; “where on earth did\\nthe Marquis pick this fellow up? Can it be that he is sharper than I\\nfancied?”\\n\\nSuddenly a new and terrifying idea flashed across his mind. “Can it be,”\\n said he, “that the fellow is not a real servant, after all? I have\\nso many enemies that one day they may strive to crush me, and however\\nskilfully I may play my cards, some one may hold a better hand.” This\\nidea alarmed him greatly, for he was in a position in which he had\\nnothing to fear; for when a great work is approaching completion, the\\nanxiety of the promoter becomes stronger and stronger. “No, no,” he\\ncontinued; “I am getting too full of suspicions;” and with these words\\nhe endeavored to put aside the vague terrors which were creeping into\\nhis soul.\\n\\nSuddenly Beaumarchef, evidently much excited, appeared upon the\\nthreshold.\\n\\n“What, you here again!” cried Mascarin, angrily; “am I to have no peace\\nto-day?”\\n\\n“Sir, the young man is here.”\\n\\n“What young man? Paul Violaine?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“Why, I told him not to come until twelve; something must have gone\\nwrong.” He broke off his speech, for at the half-open door stood\\nPaul. He was very pale, and his eyes had the expression of some hunted\\ncreature. His attire was in disorder and betokened a night spent in\\naimless wanderings to and fro.\\n\\n“Ah, sir!” said he, as he caught sight of Mascarin.\\n\\n“Leave us, Beaumarchef,” said the latter, with an imperious wave of his\\nhand; “and now, my dear boy, what is it?”\\n\\nPaul sank into a chair.\\n\\n“My life is ended,” said he; “I am lost, dishonored for ever.”\\n\\nMascarin put on a face of the most utter bewilderment, though he well\\nknew the cause of Paul’s utter prostration; but it was with the air of\\na ready sympathizer that he drew his chair nearer to that of Paul, and\\nsaid,--\\n\\n“Come, tell me all about it; what can possibly have happened to affect\\nyou thus?”\\n\\nIn deeply tragic tones, Paul replied,--\\n\\n“Rose has deserted me.”\\n\\nMascarin raised his hands to heaven.\\n\\n“And is this the reason that you say you are dishonored? Do you not see\\nthat the future is full of promise?”\\n\\n“I loved Rose,” returned Paul, and his voice was so full of pathos that\\nMascarin could hardly repress a smile. “But this is not all,” continued\\nthe unhappy boy, making a vain effort to restrain his tears; “I am\\naccused of theft.”\\n\\n“Impossible!” exclaimed Mascarin.\\n\\n“Yes, sir; and you who know everything are the only person in the world\\nwho can save me. You were so kind to me yesterday that I ventured to\\ncome here before the time appointed, in order to entreat your help.”\\n\\n“But what do you think I can do?”\\n\\n“Everything, sir; but let me tell you the whole hideous complication.”\\n\\nMascarin’s face assumed an air of the deepest interest, as he answered,\\n“Go on.”\\n\\n“After our interview,” began Paul, “I went back to the Hotel de Perou,\\nand on the mantelpiece in my garret found this note from Rose.”\\n\\nHe held it out as he spoke, but Mascarin made no effort to take it.\\n\\n“In it,” resumed Paul, “Rose tells me she no longer loves me, and begs\\nme not to seek to see her again; and also that, wearied out of poverty,\\nshe has accepted the offer of unlimited supplies of money, a carriage,\\nand diamonds.”\\n\\n“Are you surprised at this?” asked Mascarin, with a sneer.\\n\\n“How could I anticipate such an infidelity, when only the evening before\\nshe swore by all she held most sacred that she loved me only? Why did\\nshe lie to me? Did she write to make the blow fall heavier? When I\\nascended the staircase, I was picturing to myself her joy when I told\\nher of your kind promises to me. For more than an hour I remained in my\\ngarret, overwhelmed with the terrible thought that I should never see\\nher again.”\\n\\nMascarin watched Paul attentively, and came to the conclusion that his\\nwords were too fine for his grief to be sincere.\\n\\n“But what about the accusation of theft?”\\n\\n“I am coming to that,” returned the young man. “I then determined to\\nobey your injunctions and leave the Hotel de Perou, with which I was\\nmore than ever disgusted. I went downstairs to settle with Madame\\nLoupins, when ah! hideous disgrace! As I handed her the two weeks’ rent,\\nshe asked me with a contemptuous sneer, where I had stolen the money\\nfrom?”\\n\\nMascarin secretly chuckled over the success of his plans thus announced\\nby Paul.\\n\\n“What did you say?” asked he.\\n\\n“Nothing, sir; I was too horror-stricken; the man Loupins came up, and\\nboth he and his wife scowled at me threateningly. After a short pause,\\nthey asserted that they were perfectly sure that Rose and I had robbed\\nM. Tantaine.”\\n\\n“But did you not deny this monstrous charge?”\\n\\n“I was utterly bewildered, for I saw that every circumstance was against\\nme. The evening before, Rose, in reply to Madame Loupin’s importunities,\\nhad told her that she had no money, and did not know where to get any.\\nBut, as you perceive, on the very next day I appeared in a suit of new\\nclothes, and was prepared to pay my debts, while Rose had left the\\nhouse some hours before. Does not all this form a chain of strange\\ncoincidences? Rose changed the five hundred franc note that Tantaine had\\nlent me at the shop of a grocer, named Melusin, and this suspicious\\nfool was the first to raise a cry against us, and dared to assert that a\\ndetective had been ordered to watch us.”\\n\\nMascarin knew all this story better than Paul, but here he interrupted\\nhis young friend.\\n\\n“I do not understand you,” said he, “nor whether your grief arises from\\nindignation or remorse. Has there been a robbery?”\\n\\n“How can I tell? I have never seen M. Tantaine from that day. There is\\na rumor that he has been plundered and important papers taken from him,\\nand that he has consequently been arrested.”\\n\\n“Why did you not explain the facts?”\\n\\n“It would have been of no use. It would clearly prove that Tantaine was\\nno friend of mine, not even an acquaintance, and they would have laughed\\nme to scorn had I declared that the evening before he came into my room\\nand made me a present of five hundred francs.”\\n\\n“I think that I can solve the riddle,” remarked Mascarin. “I know the\\nold fellow so well.”\\n\\nPaul listened with breathless eagerness.\\n\\n“Tantaine,” resumed Mascarin, “is the best and kindest fellow in the\\nworld, but he is not quite right in the upper story. He was a\\nwealthy man once, but his liberality was his ruin. He is as poor as\\na church-mouse now, but he is as anxious as ever to be charitable.\\nUnfortunately in the place I procured for him he had a certain amount\\nof petty cash at his disposal, and moved to pity at the sight of your\\nsufferings, he gave you the money that really belonged to others. Then\\nhe sent in his accounts, and the deficiency was discovered. He lost his\\nhead, and declared that he had been robbed. You lived in the next room;\\nyou were known to be in abject poverty on the one day and in ample funds\\non the next; hence these suspicions.”\\n\\nAll was too clear to Paul, and a cold shiver ran through his frame as he\\nsaw himself arrested, tried, and condemned.\\n\\n“But,” stammered he, “M. Tantaine holds my note of hand, which is a\\nproof that I acted honestly.”\\n\\n“My poor boy, do you think that if he hoped to save himself at your\\nexpense he would produce it?”\\n\\n“Luckily, sir, you know the real state of the case.”\\n\\nMascarin shook is head.\\n\\n“Would my story be credited?” asked he. “Justice is not infallible, and\\nI must confess that appearances are against you.”\\n\\nPaul was crushed down beneath this weight of argument. “There is no\\nresource for me then but death,” murmured he, “for I will not live a\\ndishonored man.”\\n\\nThe conduct of Paul was precisely what Mascarin had expected, and he\\nfelt that the moment had arrived to strike a final blow.\\n\\n“You must not give way to despair, my boy,” said he.\\n\\nBut Paul made no reply; he had lost the power of hearing. Mascarin,\\nhowever, had no time to lose, and taking him by the arm, shook him\\nroughly. “Rouse yourself. A man in your position must help himself, and\\nbring forward proofs of his innocence.”\\n\\n“There is no use in fighting,” replied Paul. “Have you not just shown me\\nthat it is hopeless to endeavor to prove my innocence?”\\n\\nMascarin grew impatient at this unnecessary exhibition of cowardice, but\\nhe concealed his feelings as best he could.\\n\\n“No, no,” answered he; “I only wished to show you the worst side of the\\naffair.”\\n\\n“There is only one side.”\\n\\n“Not so, for it is only a supposition that Tantaine had made away\\nwith money entrusted to him, and we are not certain of it. And we only\\nsurmise that he has been arrested, and thrown the blame on you. Before\\ngiving up the game, would it not be best to be satisfied on these\\npoints?”\\n\\nPaul felt a little reassured.\\n\\n“I say nothing,” continued Mascarin, “of the influence I exercise over\\nTantaine, and which may enable me to compel him to confess the truth.”\\n\\nWeak natures like Paul’s are raised in a moment from the lowest depths\\nof depression to the highest pitch of exultation, and he already\\nconsidered that he was saved.\\n\\n“Shall I ever be able to prove my gratitude to you?” said he\\nimpulsively.\\n\\nMascarin’s face assumed a paternal expression.\\n\\n“Perhaps you may,” answered he; “and as a commencement you must entirely\\nforget the past. Daylight dispels the hideous visions of the night. I\\noffer you a fresh lease of life; will you become a new man?”\\n\\nPaul heaved a deep sigh. “Rose,” he murmured; “I cannot forget her.”\\n\\nMascarin frowned. “What,” said he, “do you still let your thoughts dwell\\non that woman? There are people who cringe to the hand that strikes\\nthem, and the more they are duped and deceived, the more they love. If\\nyou are made of this kind of stuff, we shall never get on. Go and\\nfind your faithless mistress, and beg her to come back and share your\\npoverty, and see what she will say.”\\n\\nThese sarcasms roused Paul. “I will be even with her some day,” muttered\\nhe.\\n\\n“Forget her; that is the easiest thing for you to do.”\\n\\nEven now Paul seemed to hesitate. “What,” said his patron reproachfully,\\n“have you no pride?”\\n\\n“I have, sir.”\\n\\n“You have not, or you would never wish to hamper yourself with a woman\\nlike Rose. You should keep your hands free, if you want to fight your\\nway through the battle of life.”\\n\\n“I will follow your advice, sir,” said Paul hurriedly.\\n\\n“Very soon you will thank Rose deeply for having left you. You will\\nclimb high, I can tell you, if you will work as I bid you.”\\n\\n“Then,” stammered Paul, “this situation at twelve thousand francs a\\nyear----”\\n\\n“There never has been such a situation.”\\n\\nA ghastly pallor overspread Paul’s countenance, as he saw himself again\\nreduced to beggary.\\n\\n“But, sir,” he murmured, “will you not permit me to hope--”\\n\\n“For twelve thousand francs! Be at ease, you shall have that and much\\nmore. I am getting old. I have no ties in the world--you shall be my\\nadopted son.”\\n\\nA cloud settled on Paul’s brow, for the idea that his life was to be\\npassed in this office was most displeasing to him. Mascarin divined his\\ninmost thoughts with perfect ease. “And the young fool does not know\\nwhere to go for a crust of bread,” thought he. “Ah, if there were no\\nFlavia, no Champdoce;” then, speaking aloud, he resumed, “don’t fancy,\\nmy dear boy, that I wish to condemn you to the treadmill that I am\\ncompelled to pass my life in. I have other views for you, far more\\nworthy of your merits. I have taken a great liking to you, and I will do\\nall I can to further your ambitious views. I was thinking a great\\ndeal of you, and in my head I raised the scaffolding of your future\\ngreatness. ‘He is poor,’ said I, ‘and at his age, and with his tastes,\\nthis is a cruel thing. Why, pray, should I not find a wife for him among\\nthose heiresses who have a million or two to give the man they marry?\\nWhen I talk like this, it is because I know of an heiress, and my\\nfriend, Dr. Hortebise, shall introduce her to you. She is nearly, if\\nnot quite, as pretty as Rose, and has the advantage of her in being\\nwell-born, well-educated, and wealthy. She has influential relatives,\\nand if her husband should happen to be a poet, or a composer, she could\\nassist him in becoming famous.”\\n\\nA flush came over Paul’s face, This seemed like the realization of some\\nof his former dreams.\\n\\n“With regard to your birth,” continued Mascarin, “I have devised a\\nwonderful plan. Before ‘93, you know, every bastard was treated as\\na gentleman, as he might have been the son of some high and mighty\\npersonage. Who can say that your father may not have been of the noblest\\nblood of France, and that he has not lands and wealth? He may even now\\nbe looking for you, in order to acknowledge you and make you his heir.\\nWould you like to be a duke?”\\n\\n“Ah, sir,” stammered the young man.\\n\\nMascarin burst into a fit of laughter. “Up to now,” said he, “we are\\nonly in the region of suppositions.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, what do you wish me to do?” asked Paul, after a short pause.\\n\\nMascarin put on a serious face. “I want absolute obedience from\\nyou,” said he; “a blind and undeviating obedience, one that makes no\\nobjections and asks no questions.”\\n\\n“I will obey you, sir; but, oh! do not desert me.”\\n\\nWithout making any reply, Mascarin rang for Beaumarchef, and as soon as\\nthe latter appeared, said, “I am going to Van Klopen’s, and shall leave\\nyou in charge here.” Then, turning to Paul, he added, “I always mean\\nwhat I say; we will go and breakfast at a neighboring restaurant. I want\\nto have a talk with you, and afterward--afterward, my boy, I will show\\nyou the girl I intend to be your wife. I am curious to know how you like\\nher looks.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nTHE MAN-MILLINER.\\n\\nGaston de Gandelu was much surprised at finding that Andre should be\\nignorant of the existence of Van Klopen, the best-known man in Paris.\\nTo assure oneself of this, it was only necessary to glance at his\\ncirculars, which were ornamented with the representations of medals won\\nat all sorts of exhibitions in different quarters of the world, together\\nwith various decorations received from foreign potentates. One had\\nbeen presented to him by the Queen of Spain, while he had a diploma\\nappointing him the supplier to the Court of the Czar. The great Van\\nKlopen was not an Alsatian, as was generally supposed, but a stout,\\nhandsome Dutchman, who, in the year 1850, had been a tailor in his small\\nnative town, and manufactured in cloth, purchased on credit, the\\nlong waistcoats and miraculous coats worn by the wealthy citizens of\\nRotterdam. Van Klopen, however, was not successful in his business, and\\nwas compelled to close his shop and abscond from his creditors. He took\\nrefuge in Paris, where he seemed likely to die of hunger. One day over\\na magnificent establishment in the Rue de Grammont appeared a signboard\\nwith the name of Van Klopen, dressmaker, and in the thousands of\\nhandbills distributed with the utmost profusion, he called himself\\nthe “Regenerator of Fashion.” This was an idea that would have never\\noriginated in the brain of the phlegmatic Dutchman, and whence came the\\nfunds to carry on the business? On this point he was discreetly silent.\\nThe enterprise was at first far from a success, for during nearly a\\nmonth Paris almost split its sides laughing at the absurd pretensions\\nof the self-dubbed “Regenerator of Fashion.” Van Klopen bent before the\\nstorm he had aroused, and in due time his advertisements brought him two\\ncustomers, who were the first to blow the trumpet of his fame. One was\\nthe Duchess de Suirmeuse, a very great lady indeed, and renowned for her\\neccentricities and extravagant manner, while the other was an example of\\nanother class being no less than the celebrated Jennie Fancy, who was\\nat that time under the protection of the Count de Tremouselle; and\\nfor these two Van Klopen invented such dresses as had never been\\nseen before. From this moment his success was certain; indeed, it was\\nstupendous, and Paris resounded with his praises. Now he has achieved a\\nworld-wide reputation, and has nothing to fear from the attacks of his\\nrivals. He would not execute orders for every one, saying that he must\\npick and choose his customers, and he did so, excising the names of\\nsuch as he did not think would add to his reputation. Rank and wealth\\ndisputed the honor of being his customers. The haughtiest dames did not\\nshrink from entrusting to him secrets of form and figure, which they\\neven hid from their husbands. They endured without shrinking the touch\\nof his coarse hands as he measured them. He was the rage, and his\\nshowrooms were a species of neutral ground, where women of all circles\\nof society met and examined each other. The Duchess of --- did not\\nshrink from being in the same room with the celebrated woman for whom\\nthe Baron de --- had blown out the few brains he possessed. Perhaps the\\nDuchess thought that by employing the same costumier, she might also\\ngain some of the venal beauteous attractions. Mademoiselle D---, of the\\nGymnase Theatre, who was well known to earn just one thousand francs per\\nannum, took a delight in astonishing the haughty ladies of fashion by\\nthe reckless extravagance of her orders. Van Klopen, who was a born\\ndiplomatist, distributed his favors between his different customers;\\nconsequently he was termed the most charming and angelic of men. Many\\na time had he heard the most aristocratic lips let fall the words, “I\\nshall die, Van Klopen, if my dress is not ready.” On the evenings of the\\nmost aristocratic balls a long line of carriages blocked up the road in\\nfront of his establishment, and the finest women in Paris crowded the\\nshowrooms for a word of approval from him.\\n\\nHe gave credit to approved customers, and also, it was whispered,\\nlent money to them. But woe to the woman who permitted herself to be\\nentrapped in the snare of credit that he laid for her; for the woman who\\nowed him a bill was practically lost, never knowing to what depths she\\nmight be degraded to obtain the money to settle her account. It was not\\nsurprising that such sudden prosperity should have turned Van Klopen’s\\nhead. He was stout and ruddy, impudent, vain, and cynical. His admirers\\nsaid that he was witty.\\n\\nIt was to this man’s establishment that Mascarin conducted Paul after a\\nsumptuous breakfast at Philipe’s.\\n\\nIt is necessary to give a slight description of Van Klopen’s\\nestablishment. Carpets of the most expensive description covered the\\nstairs to his door on the first floor, at which stood the liveried\\nmenials resplendent in gold lace and scarlet. As soon as Mascarin made\\nhis appearance, one of these gorgeous creatures hastened to him and\\nsaid, “M. Van Klopen is just now engaged with the Princess Korasoff, but\\nas soon as he hears of your arrival he will manage to get rid of her.\\nWill you wait for him in his private room?”\\n\\nBut Mascarin answered,--\\n\\n“We are in no hurry, and may as well wait in the public room with the\\nother customers. Are there many of them?”\\n\\n“There are about a dozen ladies, sir.”\\n\\n“Good; I am sure that they will amuse me.”\\n\\nAnd, without wasting any more words, Mascarin opened a door which led\\ninto a magnificent drawing-room, decorated in very florid style. The\\npaper on the walls almost disappeared beneath a variety of watercolor\\nsketches, representing ladies in every possible style of costume. Each\\npicture had an explanatory note beneath it, such as “Costume of Mde.\\nde C--- for a dinner at the Russian Ambassador’s,” “Ball costume of the\\nMarchioness de V--- for a ball at the Hotel de Ville,” etc.\\n\\nPaul, who was a little nervous at finding himself among such splendor,\\nhesitated in the doorway; but Mascarin seized his young friend by the\\narm, and, as he drew him to a settee, whispered in his ear,--\\n\\n“Keep your eyes about you; the heiress is here.”\\n\\nThe ladies were at first a little surprised at this invasion of the\\nroom by the male element, but Paul’s extreme beauty soon attracted their\\nattention. The hum of conversation ceased, and Paul’s embarrassment\\nincreased as he found a battery of twelve pairs of eyes directed full\\nupon him.\\n\\nMascarin, however, was quite at his ease, and upon his entrance had made\\na graceful though rather old-fashioned bow to the fair inmates of the\\nroom. His coolness was partly due to the contempt he felt for the\\nhuman race in general, and also to his colored glasses, which hid the\\nexpression of his countenance. When he saw that Paul still kept his eyes\\non the ground, he tapped him gently on the arm.\\n\\n“Is this the first time you ever saw well-dressed women? Surely you are\\nnot afraid of them. Look to the right,” continued Mascarin, “and you\\nwill see the heiress.”\\n\\nA young girl, not more than eighteen, was seated near one of the\\nwindows. She was not perhaps so beautiful as Mascarin had described,\\nbut her face was a very striking one nevertheless. She was slight and\\ngood-looking, with the clear complexion of a brunette. Her features\\nwere not perhaps very regular, but her glossy black hair was a beauty\\nin itself. She had a pair of dark, melting eyes, and her wide, high\\nforehead showed that she was gifted with great intelligence. There was\\nan air of restrained voluptuousness about her, and she seemed the very\\nembodiment of passion.\\n\\nPaul felt insensibly attracted toward her. Their eyes met, and both\\nstarted at the same moment. Paul was fascinated in an instant, and the\\ngirl’s emotion was so evident that she turned aside her head to conceal\\nit.\\n\\nThe babel had now commenced again, and general attention was being paid\\nto a lady who was enthusiastically describing the last new costume which\\nhad made its appearance in the Bois de Boulogue.\\n\\n“It was simply miraculous,” said she; “a real triumph of Van Klopen’s\\nart. The ladies of a certain class are furious, and Henry de Croisenois\\ntells me that Jenny Fancy absolutely shed tears of rage. Imagine three\\ngreen skirts of different shades, each draped----”\\n\\nMascarin, however, only paid attention to Paul and the young girl, and a\\nsarcastic smile curled his lips.\\n\\n“What do you think of her?” asked he.\\n\\n“She is adorable!” answered Paul, enthusiastically.\\n\\n“And immensely wealthy.”\\n\\n“I should fall at her feet if she had not a sou.”\\n\\nMascarin gave a little cough, and adjusted his glasses.\\n\\n“Should you, my lad?” said he to himself; “whether your admiration is\\nfor the girl or her money, you are in my grip.”\\n\\nThen he added, aloud,--\\n\\n“Would you not like to know her name?”\\n\\n“Tell me, I entreat you.”\\n\\n“Flavia.”\\n\\nPaul was in the seventh heaven, and now boldly turned his eyes on the\\ngirl, forgetting that owing to the numerous mirrors, she could see his\\nevery movement.\\n\\nThe door was at this moment opened quietly, and Van Klopen appeared on\\nthe threshold. He was about forty-four, and too stout for his height.\\nHis red, pimply face had an expression upon it of extreme insolence,\\nand his accent was thoroughly Dutch. He was dressed in a ruby velvet\\ndressing-gown, with a cravat with lace ends. A huge cluster-diamond ring\\nblazed on his coarse, red hand.\\n\\n“Who is the next one?” asked he, rudely.\\n\\nThe lady who had been talking so volubly rose to her feet, but the\\ntailor cut her short, for catching sight of Mascarin, he crossed the\\nroom, and greeted him with the utmost cordiality.\\n\\n“What!” said he; “is it you that I have been keeping waiting? Pray\\npardon me. Pray go into my private room; and this gentleman is with you?\\nDo me the favor, sir, to come with us.”\\n\\nHe was about to follow his guests, when one of the ladies started\\nforward.\\n\\n“One word with you, sir, for goodness sake!” cried she.\\n\\nVan Klopen turned sharply upon her.\\n\\n“What is the matter?” asked he.\\n\\n“My bill for three thousand francs falls due to-morrow.”\\n\\n“Very likely.”\\n\\n“But I can’t meet it.”\\n\\n“That is not my affair.”\\n\\n“I have come to beg you will renew it for two months, or say one month,\\non whatever terms you like.”\\n\\n“In two months,” answered the man brutally, “you will be no more able to\\npay than you are to-day. If you can’t pay it, it will be noted.”\\n\\n“Merciful powers! then my husband will learn all.”\\n\\n“Just so; that will be what I want; for he will then have to pay me.”\\n\\nThe wretched woman grew deadly pale.\\n\\n“My husband will pay you,” said she; “but I shall be lost.”\\n\\n“That is not my lookout. I have partners whose interests I have to\\nconsult.”\\n\\n“Do not say that, sir! He has paid my debts once, and if he should be\\nangry and take my children from me--Dear M. Van Klopen, be merciful!”\\n\\nShe wrung her hands, and the tears coursed down her cheeks; but the\\ntailor was perfectly unmoved.\\n\\n“When a woman has a family of children, one ought to have in a\\nneedlewoman by the hour.”\\n\\nShe did not desist from her efforts to soften him, and, seizing his\\nhand, strove to carry it to her lips.\\n\\n“Ah! I shall never dare to go home,” wailed she; “never have the courage\\nto tell my husband.”\\n\\n“If you are afraid of your own husband, go to some one else’s,” said he\\nroughly; and tearing himself from her, he followed Mascarin and Paul.\\n\\n“Did you hear that?” asked he, as soon as he had closed the door of his\\nroom with an angry slam. “These things occasionally occur, and are not\\nparticularly pleasant.”\\n\\nPaul looked on in disgust. If he had possessed three thousand francs, he\\nwould have given them to this unhappy woman, whose sobs he could still\\nhear in the passage.\\n\\n“It is most painful,” remarked he.\\n\\n“My dear sir,” said the tailor, “you attach too much importance to these\\nhysterical outbursts. If you were in my place, you would soon have to\\nput their right value on them. As I said before, I have to look after\\nmy own and my partners’ interests. These dear creatures care for nothing\\nbut dress; father, husband, and children are as nothing in comparison.\\nYou cannot imagine what a woman will do in order to get a new dress, in\\nwhich to outshine her rival. They only talk of their families when they\\nare called on to pay up.”\\n\\nPaul still continued to plead for some money for the poor lady, and the\\ndiscussion was getting so warm that Mascarin felt bound to interfere.\\n\\n“Perhaps,” said he, “you have been a little hard.”\\n\\n“Pooh,” returned the tailor; “I know my customer; and to-morrow my\\naccount will be settled, and I know very well where the money will come\\nfrom. Then she will give me another order, and we shall have the whole\\ncomedy over again. I know what I am about.” And taking Mascarin into\\nthe window, he made some confidential communication, at which they both\\nlaughed heartily.\\n\\nPaul, not wishing to appear to listen, examined the consulting-room,\\nas Van Klopen termed it. He saw a great number of large scissors, yard\\nmeasures, and patterns of material, and heaps of fashion plates.\\n\\nBy this time the two men had finished their conversation.\\n\\n“I had,” said Mascarin, as they returned to the fireplace, “I had meant\\nto glance through the books; but you have so many customers waiting,\\nthat I had better defer doing so.”\\n\\n“Is that all that hinders you?” returned Van Klopen, carelessly. “Wait a\\nmoment.”\\n\\nHe left the room, and in another moment his voice was heard.\\n\\n“I am sorry, ladies, very sorry, on my word; but I am busy with my silk\\nmercer. I shall not be very long.”\\n\\n“We will wait,” returned the ladies in chorus.\\n\\n“That is the way,” remarked Van Klopen, as he returned to the\\nconsulting-room. “Be civil to women, and they turn their backs on you;\\ntry and keep them off, and they run after you. If I was to put up ‘no\\nadmittance’ over my door, the street would be blocked up with women.\\nBusiness has never been better,” continued the tailor, producing a large\\nledger. “Within the last ten days we have had in orders amounting to\\neighty-seven thousand francs.”\\n\\n“Good!” answered Mascarin; “but let us have a look at the column headed\\n‘Doubtful.’”\\n\\n“Here you are,” returned the arbiter of fashion, as he turned over\\nthe leaves. “Mademoiselle Virginie Cluhe has ordered five theatrical\\ncostumes, two dinner, and three morning dresses.”\\n\\n“That is a heavy order.”\\n\\n“I wanted for that reason to consult you. She doesn’t owe us\\nmuch--perhaps a thousand francs or so.”\\n\\n“That is too much, for I hear that her friend has come to grief. Do not\\ndecline the order, but avoid taking fresh ones.”\\n\\nVan Klopen made a few mysterious signs in the margin of his ledger.\\n\\n“On the 6th of this month the Countess de Mussidan gave us an order--a\\nperfectly plain dress for her daughter. Her account is a very heavy one,\\nand the Count has warned us that he will not pay it.”\\n\\n“Never mind that. Go on with the order, put press for payment.”\\n\\n“On the 7th a new customer came--Mademoiselle Flavia, the daughter of\\nMartin Rigal, the banker.”\\n\\nWhen Paul heard this name, he could not repress a start, of which,\\nhowever, Mascarin affected to take no notice.\\n\\n“My good friend,” said he, turning to Van Klopen, “I confide this young\\nlady to you; give her your whole stock if she asks for it.”\\n\\nBy the look of surprise which appeared upon the tailor’s face, Paul\\ncould see that Mascarin was not prodigal of such recommendations.\\n\\n“You shall be obeyed,” said Van Klopen, with a bow.\\n\\n“On the 8th a young gentleman of the name of Gaston de Gandelu was\\nintroduced by Lupeaux, the jeweller. His father is, I hear, very\\nwealthy, and he will come into money on attaining his majority, which\\nis near at hand. He brought with him a lady,” continued the tailor, “and\\nsaid her name was Zora de Chantemille, a tremendously pretty girl.”\\n\\n“That young man is always in my way,” said Mascarin. “I would give\\nsomething to get him out of Paris.”\\n\\nVan Klopen reflected for a moment. “I don’t think that would be\\ndifficult,” remarked he; “that young fellow is capable of any act of\\nfolly for that fair girl.”\\n\\n“I think so too.”\\n\\n“Then the matter is easy. I will open an account with him; then, after a\\nlittle, I will affect doubts as to his solvency, and ask for a bill;\\nand we shall then place our young friend in the hands of the Mutual\\nLoan Society, and M. Verminet will easily persuade him to write his name\\nacross the bottom of a piece of stamped paper. He will bring it to me; I\\nwill accept it, and then we shall have him hard and fast.”\\n\\n“I should have proposed another course.”\\n\\n“I see no other way, however,” He suddenly stopped, for a loud noise was\\nheard in the ante-room, and the sound of voices in loud contention.\\n\\n“I should like to know,” said Van Klopen, rising to his feet, “who the\\nimpudent scoundrel is, who comes here kicking up a row. I expect that it\\nis some fool of a husband.”\\n\\n“Go and see what it is,” suggested Mascarin.\\n\\n“Not I! My servants are paid to spare me such annoyances.”\\n\\nPresently the noise ceased.\\n\\n“And now,” resumed Mascarin, “let us return to our own affairs. Under\\nthe circumstances, your proposal appears to be a good one. How\\nabout writing in another name? A little forgery would make our hands\\nstronger.” He rose, and taking the tailor into the window recess, again\\nwhispered to him.\\n\\nDuring this conversation Paul’s cheek had grown paler and paler, for,\\noccupied as he was, he could not fail to comprehend something of what\\nwas going on. During the breakfast Mascarin had partially disclosed many\\nstrange secrets, and since then he had been even more enlightened. It\\nwas but too evident to him that his protector was engaged in some dark\\nand insidious plot, and Paul felt that he was standing over a mine which\\nmight explode at any moment. He now began to fancy that there was\\nsome mysterious link between the woman Schimmel, who was so carefully\\nwatched, and the Marquis de Croisenois, so haughty, and yet on such\\nintimate terms with the proprietor of the registry office. Then there\\nwas the Countess de Mussidan, Flavia, the rich heiress, and Gaston de\\nGandelu, who was to be led into a crime the result of which would be\\npenal servitude,--all jumbled and mixed up together in one strange\\nphantasmagoria. Was he, Paul, to be a mere tool in such hands? Toward\\nwhat a precipice was he being impelled! Mascarin and Van Klopen were not\\nfriends, as he had at first supposed, but confederates in villainy. Too\\nlate did he begin to see collusion between Mascarin and Tantaine, which\\nhad resulted in his being accused of theft during his absence. But the\\nweb had been woven too securely, and should he struggle to break through\\nit, he might find himself exposed to even more terrible dangers. He felt\\nhorrified at his position, but with this there was mingled no horror of\\nthe criminality of his associates, for the skilful hand of Mascarin had\\nunwound and mastered all the bad materials of his nature. He was dazzled\\nat the glorious future held out before him, and said to himself that a\\nman like Mascarin, unfettered by law, either human or Divine, would be\\nmost likely to achieve his ends. “I should be in no danger,” mused he to\\nhimself, “if I yield myself up to the impetuous stream which is already\\ncarrying me along, for Mascarin is practised swimmer enough to keep both\\nmy head and his own above water.”\\n\\nLittle did Paul think that every fleeting expression in his countenance\\nwas caught up and treasured by the wily Mascarin; and it was\\nintentionally that he had permitted Paul to listen to this compromising\\nconversation. He had decided that very morning, that if Paul was to be a\\nuseful tool, he must be at once set face to face with the grim realities\\nof the position.\\n\\n“Now,” said he, “for the really serious reason for my visit. How do we\\nstand now with regard to the Viscountess Bois Arden?”\\n\\nVan Klopen gave his shoulders a shrug as he answered, “She is all right.\\nI have just sent her several most expensive costumes.”\\n\\n“How much does she owe you?”\\n\\n“Say twenty-five thousand francs. She has owed us more than that\\nbefore.”\\n\\n“Really?” remarked Mascarin, “that woman has been grossly libelled; she\\nis vain, frivolous, and fond of admiration, but nothing more. For a\\nwhole fortnight I have been prying into her life, but I can’t hit\\nupon anything in it to give us a pull over her. The debt may help us,\\nhowever. Does her husband know that she has an account with us?”\\n\\n“Of course he does not; he is most liberal to her, and if he inquired--”\\n\\n“Then we are all right; we will send in the bill to him.”\\n\\n“But, my good sir,” urged Van Klopen, “it was only last week that she\\npaid us a heavy sum on account.”\\n\\n“The more reason to press her, for she must be hard up.”\\n\\nVan Klopen would have argued further, but an imperious sign from\\nMascarin reduced him to silence.\\n\\n“Listen to me,” said Mascarin, “and please do not interrupt me. Are you\\nknown to the domestics at the house of the Viscountess?”\\n\\n“Not at all.”\\n\\n“Well, then, at three o’clock sharp, the day after to-morrow, call on\\nher. Her footman will say that Madame has a visitor with her.”\\n\\n“I will say I will wait.”\\n\\n“Not at all. You must almost force your way in, and you will find\\nthe Viscountess talking to the Marquis de Croisenois. You know him, I\\nsuppose?”\\n\\n“By sight--nothing more.”\\n\\n“That is sufficient. Take no notice of him; but at once present your\\nbill, and violently insist upon immediate payment.”\\n\\n“What can you be thinking of? She will have me kicked out of doors.”\\n\\n“Quite likely; but you must threaten to take the bill to her husband.\\nShe will command you to leave the house, but you will sit down doggedly\\nand declare that you will not move until you get the money.”\\n\\n“But that is most unbusinesslike behavior.”\\n\\n“I quite agree with you; but the Marquis de Croisenois will interfere;\\nhe will throw a pocketbook in your face, exclaiming, ‘There is your\\nmoney, you impudent scoundrel!’”\\n\\n“Then I am to slink away?”\\n\\n“Yes, but before doing so, you will give a receipt in this\\nform--‘Received from the Marquis de Croisenois, the sum of so many\\nfrancs, in settlement of the account of the Viscountess Bois Arden.’”\\n\\n“If I could only understand the game,” muttered the puzzled Van Klopen.\\n\\n“There is no necessity for that now; only act up to your instructions.”\\n\\n“I will obey, but remember that we shall not only lose her custom, but\\nthat of all her acquaintance.”\\n\\nAgain the same angry sounds were heard in the corridor.\\n\\n“It is scandalous,” cried a voice. “I have been waiting an hour;\\nmy sword and armor. What, ho, lackeys; hither, I say. Van Klopen is\\nengaged, is he? Hie to him and say I must see him at once.”\\n\\nThe two accomplices exchanged looks, as though they recognized the\\nshrill, squeaky voice.\\n\\n“That is our man,” whispered Mascarin, as the door was violently\\nflung open, and Gaston de Gandelu burst in. He was dressed even more\\nextravagantly than usual, and his face was inflamed with rage.\\n\\n“Here am I,” cried he; “and an awful rage I am in. Why, I have been\\nwaiting twenty minutes. I don’t care a curse for your rules and\\nregulations.”\\n\\nThe tailor was furious at this intrusion; but as Mascarin was present,\\nand he felt that he must respect his orders, he by a great effort\\ncontrolled himself.\\n\\n“Had I known, sir,” said he sulkily, “that you were here----”\\n\\nThese few words mollified the gorgeous youth, who at once broke in.\\n\\n“I accept your apologies,” cried he; “the lackeys remove our arms, the\\njoust is over. My horses have been standing all this time, and may have\\ntaken cold. Of course you have seen my horses. Splendid animals, are\\nthey not? Zora is in the other room. Quick, fetch her here.”\\n\\nWith these words he rushed into the passage and shouted out, “Zora,\\nMademoiselle de Chantemille, my dear one, come hither.”\\n\\nThe renowned tailor was exquisitely uncomfortable at so terrible a scene\\nin his establishment. He cast an appealing glance at Mascarin, but the\\nface of the agent seemed carved in marble. As to Paul, he was quite\\nprepared to accept this young gentleman as a perfect type of the glass\\nof fashion and the mould of form, and could not forbear pitying him in\\nhis heart. He went across the room to Mascarin.\\n\\n“Is there no way,” whispered he, “of saving this poor young fellow?”\\n\\nMascarin smiled one of those livid smiles which chilled the hearts of\\nthose who knew him thoroughly.\\n\\n“In fifteen minutes,” said he, “I will put the same question to you,\\nleaving you to reply to it. Hush, this is the first real test that you\\nhave been subjected to; if you are not strong enough to go through it,\\nthen we had better say farewell. Be firm, for a thunderbolt is about to\\nfall!”\\n\\nThe manner in which these apparently trivial words were spoken startled\\nPaul, who, by a strong effort, recovered his self-possession; but,\\nprepared as he was, it was with the utmost difficulty that he stifled\\nthe expression of rage and surprise that rose to his lips at the sight\\nof the woman who entered the room. The Madame de Chantemille, the Zora\\nof the youthful Gandelu, was there, attired in what to his eyes seemed\\na most dazzling costume. Rose seemed a little timid as Gandelu almost\\ndragged her into the room.\\n\\n“How silly you are!” said he. “What is there to be frightened at? He is\\nonly in a rage with his flunkies for having kept us waiting.”\\n\\nZora sank negligently into an easy chair, and the gorgeously attired\\nyouth addressed the all-powerful Van Klopen.\\n\\n“Well, have you invented a costume that will be worthy of Madame’s\\ncharms?”\\n\\nFor a few moments Van Klopen appeared to be buried in profound\\nmeditation.\\n\\n“Ah,” said he, raising his hand with a grandiloquent gesture, “I have\\nit; I can see it all in my mind’s eye.”\\n\\n“What a man!” murmured Gaston in deep admiration.\\n\\n“Listen,” resumed the tailor, his eye flashing with the fire of\\ngenius. “First, a walking costume with a polonaise and a cape _a\\nla pensionnaire_; bodice, sleeves, and underskirt of a brilliant\\nchestnut----”\\n\\nHe might have continued in this strain for a long time, and Zora would\\nnot have heard a word, for she had caught sight of Paul, and in spite of\\nall her audacity, she nearly fainted. She was so ill at ease, that\\nyoung Gandelu at last perceived it; but not knowing the effect that the\\nappearance of Paul would necessarily cause, and being also rather dull\\nof comprehension he could not understand the reason for it.\\n\\n“Hold hard, Van Klopen, hold hard! the joy has been too much for her,\\nand I will lay you ten to one that she is going into hysterics.”\\n\\nMascarin saw that Paul’s temper might blaze forth at any moment, and\\nso hastened to put an end to a scene which was as absurd as it was\\ndangerous.\\n\\n“Well, Van Klopen, I will say farewell,” said he. “Good morning, madame;\\ngood morning, sir;” and taking Paul by the arm, he led him away by a\\nprivate exit which did not necessitate their passing through the great\\nreception-room.\\n\\nIt was time for him to do so, and not until they were in the street did\\nthe wily Mascarin breathe freely.\\n\\n“Well, what do you say, now?” asked he.\\n\\nPaul’s vanity had been so deeply wounded, and the effort that he had\\nmade to restrain himself so powerful, that he could only reply by a\\ngasp.\\n\\n“He felt it more than I thought he would,” said Mascarin to himself.\\n“The fresh air will revive him.”\\n\\nPaul’s legs bent under him, and he staggered so that Mascarin led him\\ninto a little _café_ hard by, and ordered a glass of cognac, and in a\\nshort time Paul was himself once again.\\n\\n“You are better now,” observed Mascarin; and then, believing it would be\\nbest to finish his work, he added, “A quarter of an hour ago I promised\\nthat I would ask you to settle what our intentions were to be regarding\\nM. de Gandelu.”\\n\\n“That is enough,” broke in Paul, violently.\\n\\nMascarin put on his most benevolent smile.\\n\\n“You see,” remarked he, “how circumstances change ideas. Now you are\\ngetting quite reasonable.”\\n\\n“Yes, I am reasonable enough now; that is, that I mean to be wealthy.\\nYou have no need to urge me on any more. I am willing to do whatever you\\ndesire, for I will never again endure degradation like that I have gone\\nthrough to-day.”\\n\\n“You have let temper get the better of you,” returned Mascarin, with a\\nshrug of his shoulders.\\n\\n“My anger may pass over, but my determination will remain as strong as\\never.”\\n\\n“Do not decide without thinking the matter well over,” answered the\\nagent. “To-day you are your own master; but if you give yourself up to\\nme, you must resign your dearly loved liberty.”\\n\\n“I am prepared for all.”\\n\\nVictory had inclined to the side of Mascarin, and he was proportionally\\njubilant.\\n\\n“Good,” said he. “Then Dr. Hortebise shall introduce you to Martin\\nRigal, the father of Mademoiselle Flavia, and one week after your\\nmarriage I will give you a duke’s coronet to put on the panels of your\\ncarriage.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\nA STARTLING REVELATION.\\n\\nWhen Sabine de Mussidan told her lover that she would appeal to the\\ngenerosity of M. de Breulh-Faverlay, she had not calculated on the\\nnecessity she would have for endurance, but had rather listened to the\\ndictates of her heart; and this fact came the more strongly before her,\\nwhen in the solitude of her own chamber, she inquired of herself how she\\nwas to carry out her promise. It seemed to her very terrible to have to\\nlay bare the secrets of her soul to any one, but the more so to M. de\\nBreulh-Faverlay, who had asked for her hand in marriage. She uttered no\\nword on her way home, where she arrived just in time to take her place\\nat the dinner table, and never was a more dismal company assembled for\\nthe evening meal. Her own miseries occupied Sabine, and her father\\nand mother were suffering from their interviews with Mascarin and Dr.\\nHortebise. What did the liveried servants, who waited at table with\\nsuch an affectation of interest, care for the sorrows of their master\\nor mistress? They were well lodged and well fed, and nothing save their\\nwages did they care for. By nine o’clock Sabine was in her own room\\ntrying to grow accustomed to the thoughts of an interview with M. de\\nBreulh-Faverlay. She hardly closed her eyes all night, and felt worn out\\nand dispirited by musing; but she never thought of evading the promise\\nshe had made to Andre, or of putting it off for a time. She had vowed\\nto lose no time, and her lover was eagerly awaiting a letter from her,\\ntelling him of the result. In the perplexity in which she found herself,\\nshe could not confide in either father or mother, for she felt that a\\ncloud hung over both their lives, though she knew not what it was. When\\nshe left the convent where she had been educated, and returned home, she\\nfelt that she was in the way, and that the day of her marriage would be\\none of liberation to her parents from their cares and responsibilities.\\nAll this prayed terribly upon her mind, and might have driven a less\\npure-minded girl to desperate measures. It seemed to her that it\\nwould be less painful to fly from her father’s house than to have this\\ninterview with M. de Breulh-Faverlay. Luckily for her, frail as she\\nlooked, she possessed an indomitable will, and this carried her through\\nmost of her difficulties.\\n\\nFor Andre’s sake, as well as her own, she did not wish to violate any\\nof the unwritten canons of society, but she longed for the hour to come\\nwhen she could acknowledge her love openly to the world. At one moment\\nshe thought of writing a letter, but dismissed the thought as the height\\nof folly. As the time passed Sabine began to reproach herself for her\\ncowardice. All at once she heard the clang of the opening of the main\\ngates. Peeping from her window, she saw a carriage drive up, and, to her\\ninexpressible delight, M. de Breulh-Faverlay alighted from it.\\n\\n“Heaven has heard my prayer, and sent him to me,” murmured she.\\n\\n“What do you intend to do, Mademoiselle?” asked the devoted Modeste;\\n“will you speak to him now?”\\n\\n“Yes, I will. My mother is still in her dressing-room, and no one\\nwill venture to disturb my father in the library. If I meet M. de\\nBreulh-Faverlay in the hall and take him into the drawing-room, I shall\\nhave time for a quarter of an hour’s talk, and that will be sufficient.”\\n\\nCalling up all her courage, she left her room on her errand. Had Andre\\nseen the man selected by the Count de Mussidan for his daughter’s\\nhusband, he might well have been proud of her preference for him. M. de\\nBreulh-Faverlay was one of the best known men in Paris, and fortune\\nhad showered all her blessings on his head. He was not forty, of an\\nextremely aristocratic appearance, highly educated, and witty; and, in\\naddition, one of the largest landholders in the country. He had always\\nrefused to enter public life. “For,” he would say to those who spoke to\\nhim on the matter, “I have enough to spend my money on without making\\nmyself ridiculous.” He was a perfect type of what a French gentleman\\nshould be--courteous, of unblemished reputation, and full of chivalrous\\ndevotion and generosity. He was, it is said, a great favorite with the\\nfair sex; but, if report spoke truly, his discretion was as great as\\nhis success. He had not always been wealthy, and there was a mysterious\\nromance in his life. When he was only twenty, he had sailed for South\\nAmerica, where he remained twelve years, and returned no richer than\\nhe was before; but shortly afterward his aged uncle, the Marquis de\\nFaverlay, died bequeathing his immense fortune to his nephew on the\\ncondition that he should add the name of Faverlay to that of De Breulh.\\nDe Breulh was passionately fond of horses; but he was really a lover of\\nthem, and not a mere turfite, and this was all that the world knew of\\nthe man who held in his hands the fates of Sabine de Mussidan and Andre.\\nAs soon as he caught sight of Sabine he made a profound inclination.\\n\\nThe girl came straight up to him.\\n\\n“Sir,” said she, in a voice broken by conflicting emotions, “may I\\nrequest the pleasure of a short private conversation with you?”\\n\\n“Mademoiselle,” answered De Breulh, concealing his surprise beneath\\nanother bow, “I am at your disposal.”\\n\\nOne of the footmen, at a word from Sabine, threw open the door of the\\ndrawing-room in which the Countess had thrown down her arms in her duel\\nwith Dr. Hortebise. Sabine did not ask her visitor to be seated, but\\nleaning her elbow on the marble mantel-piece, she said, after a silence\\nequally trying to both,--\\n\\n“This strange conduct on my part, sir, will show you, more than any\\nexplanation, my sincerity, and the perfect confidence with which you\\nhave inspired me.”\\n\\nShe paused, but De Breulh made no reply, for he was perfectly mystified.\\n\\n“You are,” she continued, “my parents’ intimate friend, and must have\\nseen the discomforts of our domestic hearth, and that though both my\\nfather and mother are living, I am as desolate as the veriest orphan.”\\n\\nFearing that M. de Breulh might not understand her reason for speaking\\nthus, she threw a shade of haughtiness into her manner as she resumed,--\\n\\n“My reason, sir, for seeing you to-day is to ask,--nay, to entreat\\nyou, to release me from my engagement to you, and to take the whole\\nresponsibility of the rupture on yourself.”\\n\\nMan of the world as he was, M. de Breulh could not conceal his surprise,\\nin which a certain amount of wounded self-love was mingled.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle!” commenced he--\\n\\nSabine interrupted him.\\n\\n“I am asking a great favor, and your granting it will spare me many\\nhours of grief and sadness, and,” she added, as a faint smile flickered\\nacross her pallid features, “I am aware that I am asking but a trifling\\nsacrifice on your part. You know scarcely anything of me, and therefore\\nyou can only feel indifference toward me.”\\n\\n“You are mistaken,” replied the young man gravely; “and you do not judge\\nme rightly. I am not a mere boy, and always consider a step before I\\ntake it; and if I asked for your hand, it was because I had learned to\\nappreciate the greatness both of your heart and intellect; and I believe\\nthat if you would condescend to accept me, we could be very happy\\ntogether.”\\n\\nThe girl seemed about to speak, but De Breulh continued,--\\n\\n“It seems, however, that I have in some way displeased you,--I do not\\nknow how; but, believe me, it will be a source of sorrow to me for the\\nrest of my life.”\\n\\nDe Breulh’s sincerity was so evident, that Mademoiselle de Mussidan was\\ndeeply affected.\\n\\n“You have not displeased me in any way,” answered she softly, “and are\\nfar too good for me. To have become your wife would have made me a proud\\nand happy woman.”\\n\\nHere she stopped, almost choked by her tears, but M. de Breulh wished to\\nfathom this mystery.\\n\\n“Why then this resolve?” asked he.\\n\\n“Because,” replied Sabine faintly, as she hid her face,--“because I have\\ngiven all my love to another.”\\n\\nThe young man uttered an exclamation so full of angry surprise, that\\nSabine turned upon him at once.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” answered she, “to another; one utterly unknown to my\\nparents, yet one who is inexpressibly dear to me. This ought not to\\nirritate you, for I gave him my love long before I met you. Besides, you\\nhave every advantage over him. He is at the foot, while you are at the\\nsummit, of the social ladder. You are of aristocratic lineage,--he is\\none of the people. You have a noble name,--he does not even know his\\nown. Your wealth is enormous,--while he works hard for his daily bread.\\nHe has all the fire of genius, but the cruel cares of life drag and\\nfetter him to the earth. He carries on a workman’s trade to supply funds\\nto study his beloved art.”\\n\\nIncautiously, Sabine had chosen the very means to wound this noble\\ngentleman most cruelly, for her whole beauty blazed out as, inflamed by\\nher passion, she spoke so eloquently of Andre and drew such a parallel\\nbetween the two young men.\\n\\n“Now, sir,” said she, “do you comprehend me? I know the terrible social\\nabyss which divides me from the man I love, and the future may hold in\\nstore some terrible punishment for my fidelity to him, but no one shall\\never hear a word of complaint from my lips, for----” she hesitated, and\\nthen uttered these simple words--“for I love him.”\\n\\nM. de Breulh listened with an outwardly impassible face, but the venomed\\ntooth of jealousy was gnawing at his heart. He had not told Sabine the\\nentire truth, for he had studied her for a long time, and his love had\\ngrown firm and strong. Without an unkind thought the girl had shattered\\nthe edifice which he had built up with such care and pain. He would have\\ngiven his name, rank, and title to have been in this unknown lover’s\\nplace, who, though he worked for his bread, and had no grand ancestral\\nname, was yet so fondly loved. Many a man in his position would have\\nshrugged his shoulders and coldly sneered at the words, “I love him,”\\n but he did not, for his nature was sufficiently noble to sympathize\\nwith hers. He admired her courage and frankness, which disdaining all\\nsubterfuges, went straight and unhesitatingly to the point she desired\\nto reach. She might be imprudent and reckless, but in his eyes these\\nseemed hardly to be faults, for it is seldom that convent-bred young\\nladies err in this way.\\n\\n“But this man,” said he, after a long pause,--“how do you manage ever to\\nsee him?\\n\\n“I meet him out walking,” replied she, “and I sometimes go to his\\nstudio.”\\n\\n“To his studio?”\\n\\n“Yes, I have sat to him several times for my portrait; but I have\\nnever done anything that I need blush to own. You know all now, sir,”\\n continued Sabine; “and it has been very hard for a young girl like me\\nto say all this to you. It is a thing that ought to be confided to my\\nmother.”\\n\\nOnly those who have heard a woman that they are ardently attached to\\nsay, “I do not love you,” can picture M. de Breulh’s frame of mind.\\nHad any one else than Sabine made this communication he would not have\\nwithdrawn, but would have contested the prize with his more fortunate\\nrival. But now that Mademoiselle de Mussidan had, as it were, thrown\\nherself upon his mercy, he could not bring himself to take advantage of\\nher confidence.\\n\\n“It shall be as you desire,” said he, with a faint tinge of bitterness\\nin his tone. “To-night I will write to your father, and withdraw my\\ndemand for your hand. It is the first time that I have ever gone back\\nfrom my word; and I am sure that your father will be highly indignant.”\\n\\nSabine’s strength and firmness had now entirely deserted her. “From\\nthe depth of my soul, sir,” said she, “I thank you; for by this act of\\ngenerosity I shall avoid a contest that I dreaded.”\\n\\n“Unfortunately,” broke in De Breulh, “you do not see how useless to\\nyou will be the sacrifice that you exact from me. Listen! you have not\\nappeared much in society; and when you did, it was in the character of\\nmy betrothed; as soon as I withdraw hosts of aspirants for your hand\\nwill spring up.”\\n\\nSabine heaved a deep sigh, for Andre had foreseen the same result.\\n\\n“Then,” continued De Breulh, “your situation will become even a more\\ntrying one; for if your noble qualities are not enough to excite\\nadmiration in the bosoms of the other sex, your immense wealth will\\narouse the cupidity of the fortune-hunters.”\\n\\nWhen De Breulh referred to fortune-hunters, was this a side blow at\\nAndre? With this thought rushing through her brain, she gazed upon him\\neagerly, but read no meaning in his eyes.\\n\\n“Yes,” answered she dreamily, “it is true that I am very wealthy.”\\n\\n“And what will be your reply to the next suitor, and to the one after\\nthat?” asked De Breulh.\\n\\n“I know not; but I shall find some loophole of escape when the time\\ncomes; for if I act in obedience to the dictates of my heart and\\nconscience, I cannot do wrong, for Heaven will come to my aid.”\\n\\nThe phrase sounded like a dismissal; but De Breulh, man of the world as\\nhe was, did not accept it.\\n\\n“May I permit myself to offer you a word of advice?”\\n\\n“Do so, sir.”\\n\\n“Very well, then; why not permit matters to remain as they now are? So\\nlong as our rupture is not public property, so long will you be left\\nin peace. It would be the simplest thing in the world to postpone all\\ndecisive steps for a twelvemonth, and I would withdraw as soon as you\\nnotified me that it was time.”\\n\\nSabine put every confidence in this proposal, believing that everything\\nwas in good faith. “But,” said she, “such a subterfuge would be unworthy\\nof us all.”\\n\\nM. de Breulh did not urge this point; a feeling of deep sympathy had\\nsucceeded to his wounded pride; and, with all the chivalrous instinct of\\nhis race, he determined to do his best to assist these lovers.\\n\\n“Might I be permitted,” asked he, “now that you have placed so much\\nconfidence in me, to make the acquaintance of the man whom you have\\nhonored with your love?”\\n\\nSabine colored deeply. “I have no reason to conceal anything from you:\\nhis name is Andre, he is a painter, and lives in the Rue de la Tour\\nd’Auvergne.”\\n\\nDe Breulh made a mental note of the name, and continued,--\\n\\n“Do not think that I ask this question from mere idle curiosity; my only\\ndesire is to aid you. I should be glad to be a something in your life. I\\nhave influential friends and connections----”\\n\\nSabine was deeply wounded. Did this man propose patronizing Andre, and\\nthus place his position and wealth in contrast with that of the obscure\\npainter? In his eagerness de Breulh had made a false move.\\n\\n“I thank you,” answered she coldly; “but Andre is very proud, and any\\noffer of assistance would wound him deeply. Forgive my scruples, which\\nare perhaps exaggerated and absurd. All he has of his own are his\\nself-respect and his natural pride.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Sabine rang the bell, to show her visitor that the\\nconversation was at an end.\\n\\n“Have you informed my mother of M. de Breulh-Faverlay’s arrival?” asked\\nshe, as the footman appeared at the door.\\n\\n“I have not, mademoiselle; for both the Count and Countess gave the\\nstrictest order that they were not to be disturbed on any pretext\\nwhatsoever.”\\n\\n“Why did you not tell me that before?” demanded M. de Breulh; and,\\nwithout waiting for any explanation, he bowed gravely to Sabine, and\\nquitted the room, after apologizing for his involuntary intrusion, and\\nby his manner permitted all the domestics to see that he was much put\\nout.\\n\\n“Ah!” sighed Sabine, “that man is worthy of some good and true woman’s\\naffection.”\\n\\nAs she was about to leave the room, she heard some one insisting upon\\nseeing the Count de Mussidan. Not being desirous of meeting strangers,\\nshe remained where she was. The servant persisted in saying that his\\nmaster could receive no one.\\n\\n“What do I care for your orders?” cried the visitor; “your master would\\nnever refuse to see his friend the Baron de Clinchain;” and, thrusting\\nthe lackey on one side, he entered the drawing-room; and his agitation\\nwas so great that he hardly noticed the presence of the young girl.\\n\\nM. de Clinchain was a thoroughly commonplace looking personage in face,\\nfigure, and dress, neither tall nor short, handsome nor ill-looking. The\\nonly noticeable point in his attire was that he wore a coral hand on his\\nwatch chain; for the Baron was a firm believer in the evil eye. When a\\nyoung man, he was most methodical in his habits; and, as he grew older,\\nthis became an absolute mania with him. When he was twenty, he recorded\\nin his diary the pulsations of his heart, and at forty he added remarks\\nregarding his digestion and general health.\\n\\n“What a fearful blow!” murmured he; “and to fall at such a moment when I\\nhad indulged in a more hearty dinner than usual. I shall feel it for the\\nnext six months, even if it does not kill me outright.”\\n\\nJust then M. de Mussidan entered the room, and the excited man ran up to\\nhim, exclaiming,--\\n\\n“For Heaven’s sake, Octave, save us both, by cancelling your daughter’s\\nengagement with M. de--”\\n\\nThe Count laid his hand upon his friend’s lips.\\n\\n“Are you mad?” said he; “my daughter is here.”\\n\\nIn obedience to a warning gesture, Sabine left the room; but she\\nhad heard enough to fill her heart with agitation and terror. What\\nengagement was to be cancelled, and how could such a rupture affect her\\nfather or his friend? That there was some mystery, was proved by the\\nquestion with which the Count had prevented his friend from saying any\\nmore. She was sure that it was the name of M. de Breulh-Faverlay with\\nwhich the Baron was about to close his sentence, and felt that the\\ndestiny of her life was to be decided in the conversation about to take\\nplace between her father and his visitor. It was deep anxiety that she\\nfelt, not mere curiosity; and while these thoughts passed through her\\nbrain, she remembered that she could hear all from the card-room, the\\ndoorway of which was only separated from the drawing-room by a curtain.\\nWith a soft, gliding step she gained her hiding-place and listened\\nintently. The Baron was still pouring out his lamentations.\\n\\n“What a fearful day this has been!” groaned the unhappy man. “I ate much\\ntoo heavy a breakfast, I have been terribly excited, and came here a\\ngreat deal too fast. A fit of passion caused by a servant’s insolence,\\njoy at seeing you, then a sudden interruption to what I was going to\\nsay, are a great deal more than sufficient to cause a serious illness at\\nmy age.”\\n\\nBut the Count, who was usually most considerate of his friend’s foibles,\\nwas not in a humor to listen to him.\\n\\n“Come, let us talk sense,” said he sharply; “tell me what has occurred.”\\n\\n“Occurred!” groaned De Clinchain; “oh, nothing, except that the whole\\ntruth is known regarding what took place in the little wood so many\\nyears back. I had an anonymous letter this morning, threatening me with\\nall sorts of terrible consequences if I do not hinder you from\\nmarrying your daughter to De Breulh. The rogues say that they can prove\\neverything.”\\n\\n“Have you the letter with you?”\\n\\nDe Clinchain drew the missive from his pocket. It was to the full as\\nthreatening as he had said; but M. de Mussidan knew all its contents\\nbeforehand.\\n\\n“Have you examined your diary, and are the three leaves really missing?”\\n\\n“They are.”\\n\\n“How were they stolen? Are you sure of your servants?”\\n\\n“Certainly; my valet has been sixteen years in my service. You know\\nLorin? The volumes of my diary are always locked up in the escritoire,\\nthe key of which never leaves me. And none of the other servants ever\\nenter my room.”\\n\\n“Some one must have done so, however.”\\n\\nClinchain struck his forehead, as though an idea had suddenly flashed\\nacross his brain.\\n\\n“I can partly guess,” said he. “Some time ago Lorin went for a holiday,\\nand got drunk with some fellows he picked up in the train. Drink brought\\non fighting, and he was so knocked about that he was laid up for\\nsome weeks. He had a severe knife wound in the shoulder and was much\\nbruised.”\\n\\n“Who took his place?”\\n\\n“A young fellow that my groom got at a servants’ registry office.”\\n\\nM. de Mussidan felt that he was on the right track, for he remembered\\nthat the man who had called on him had had the audacity to leave a card,\\non which was marked:\\n\\n“B. MASCARIN,\\n\\n“Servants’ Registry Office,\\n“Rue Montorgueil.”\\n\\n“Do you know where this place is?” asked he.\\n\\n“Certainly; in the Rue du Dauphin nearly opposite to my house.”\\n\\nThe Count swore a deep oath. “The rogues are very wily; but, my dear\\nfellow if you are ready, we will defy the storm together.”\\n\\nDe Clinchain felt a cold tremor pass through his whole frame at this\\nproposal.\\n\\n“Not I,” said he; “do not try and persuade me. If you have come to this\\ndecision, let me know at once, and I will go home and finish it all with\\na pistol bullet.”\\n\\nHe was just the sort of nervous, timorous man to do exactly as he said,\\nand would sooner have killed himself than endure all kinds of annoyance,\\nwhich might impair his digestion.\\n\\n“Very well,” answered his friend, with sullen resignation, “then I will\\ngive in.”\\n\\nDe Clinchain heaved a deep sigh of relief, for he, not knowing what had\\npassed before, had expected to have had a much more difficult task in\\npersuading his friend.\\n\\n“You are acting like a reasonable man for once in your life,” said he.\\n\\n“You think so, because I give ear to your timorous advice. A thousand\\ncurses on that idiotic habit of yours of putting on paper not only your\\nown secrets, but those of others.”\\n\\nBut at this remark Clinchain mounted his hobby.\\n\\n“Do not talk like that,” said he. “Had you not committed the act, it\\nwould not have appeared in my diary.”\\n\\nChilled to the very bone, and quivering like an aspen leaf, Sabine had\\nlistened to every word. The reality was even more dreadful than she\\nhad dreamed of. There was a hidden sorrow, a crime in her father’s past\\nlife.\\n\\nAgain the Count spoke. “There is no use in recrimination. We cannot wipe\\nout the past, and must, therefore, submit. I promise you, on my honor,\\nthat this day I will write to De Breulh, and tell him this marriage must\\nbe given up.”\\n\\nThese words threw the balm of peace and safety into De Clinchain’s soul,\\nbut the excess of joy was too much for him, and murmuring, “Too much\\nbreakfast, and the shock of too violent an emotion,” he sank back,\\nfainting, on a couch.\\n\\nThe Count de Mussidan was terrified, he pulled the bell furiously, and\\nthe domestics rushed in, followed by the Countess. Restoratives were\\napplied, and in ten minutes the Baron opened one eye, and raised himself\\non his elbow.\\n\\n“I am better now,” said he, with a faint smile. “It is weakness and\\ndizziness. I know what I ought to take--two spoonfuls of _eau des\\ncarmes_ in a glass of sugar and water, with perfect repose of both mind\\nand body. Fortunately, my carriage is here. Pray, be prudent, Mussidan.”\\n And, leaning upon the arm of one of the lackeys, he staggered feebly\\nout, leaving the Count and Countess alone, and Sabine still listening\\nfrom her post of espial in the card-room.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\nHUSBAND AND WIFE.\\n\\nEver since Mascarin’s visit, the Count de Mussidan had been in a\\ndeplorable state of mind. Forgetting the injury to his foot, he passed\\nthe night pacing up and down the library, cudgelling his brains for some\\nmeans of breaking the meshes of the net in which he was entangled. He\\nknew the necessity for immediate action, for he felt sure that this\\ndemand would only be the forerunner of numerous others of a similar\\ncharacter. He thought over and dismissed many schemes. Sometimes he had\\nalmost decided to go to the police authorities and make a clean breast;\\nthen the idea of placing the affair in the hands of a private detective\\noccurred to him; but the more he deliberated, the more he realized the\\nstrength of the cord that bound him, and the scandal which exposure\\nwould cause. This long course of thought had in some measure softened\\nthe bitterness of his wrath, and he was able to receive his old\\nfriend M. de Clinchain with some degree of calmness. He was not at\\nall surprised at the receipt of the anonymous letter,--indeed, he had\\nexpected that a blow would be struck in that direction. Still immersed\\nin thought, M. de Mussidan hardly took heed of his wife’s presence,\\nand he still paced the room, uttering a string of broken phrases. This\\nexcited the attention of the Countess, for her own threatened position\\ncaused her to be on the alert.\\n\\n“What is annoying you, Octave?” asked she. “Surely, not M. de\\nClinchain’s attack of indigestion?”\\n\\nFor many years the Count had been accustomed to that taunting and\\nsarcastic voice, but this feeble joke at such a moment was more than he\\ncould endure.\\n\\n“Don’t address me in that manner,” said he angrily.\\n\\n“What is the matter--are you not well?”\\n\\n“Madame!”\\n\\n“Will you have the kindness to tell me what has taken place?”\\n\\nThe color suffused the Count’s face, and his rage burst forth the more\\nfuriously from his having had to suppress it so long; and coming to\\na halt before the chair in which the Countess was lounging, his eyes\\nblazing with hate and anger, he exclaimed,--\\n\\n“All I wish to tell you is, that De Breulh-Faverlay shall not marry our\\ndaughter.”\\n\\nMadame de Mussidan was secretly delighted at this reply, for it showed\\nher that half the task required of her by Dr. Hortebise had been\\naccomplished without her interference; but in order to act cautiously,\\nshe began at once to object, for a woman’s way is always at first to\\noppose what she most desires.\\n\\n“You are laughing at me, Count!” said she. “Where can we hope to find so\\ngood a match again?”\\n\\n“You need not be afraid,” returned the Count, with a sneer; “you shall\\nhave another son-in-law.”\\n\\nThese words sent a pang through the heart of the Countess. Was it an\\nallusion to the past? or had the phrase dropped from her husband’s lips\\naccidentally? or had he any suspicion of the influence that had been\\nbrought to bear upon her? She, however, had plenty of courage, and would\\nrather meet misfortune face to face than await its coming in dread.\\n\\n“Of what other son-in-law are you speaking?” asked she negligently. “Has\\nany other suitor presented himself? May I ask his name? Do you intend to\\nsettle my child’s future without consulting me?”\\n\\n“I do, madame.”\\n\\nA contemptuous smile crossed the face of the Countess, which goaded the\\nCount to fury.\\n\\n“Am I not the master here?” exclaimed he in accents of intense rage.\\n“Am I not driven to the exercise of my power by the menaces of a pack of\\nvillains who have wormed out the hidden secrets which have overshadowed\\nmy life from my youth upward? They can, if they desire, drag my name\\nthrough the mire of infamy.”\\n\\nMadame de Mussidan bounded to her feet, asking herself whether her\\nhusband’s intellect had not given way.\\n\\n“You commit a crime!” gasped she.\\n\\n“I, madame, I myself! Does that surprise you? Have you never had any\\nsuspicion? Perhaps you have not forgotten a fatal accident which took\\nplace out shooting, and darkened the earlier years of our married life?\\nWell, the thing was not an accident, but a deliberate murder committed\\nby me. Yes, I murdered him, and this fact is known, and can be proved.”\\n\\nThe Countess grew deadly pale, and extended her hand, as though to guard\\nherself from some coming danger.\\n\\n“You are horrified, are you?” continued the Count, with a sneer.\\n“Perhaps I inspire you with horror; but do not fear; the blood is no\\nlonger on my hands, but it is here, and is choking me.” And as he spoke\\nhe pressed his fingers upon his heart. “For twenty-three years I have\\nendured this hideous recollection and even now when I wake in the night\\nI am bathed in cold sweat, for I fancy I can hear the last gasps of the\\nunhappy man.”\\n\\n“This is horrible, too horrible!” murmured Madame de Mussidan faintly.\\n\\n“Ah, but you do not know why I killed him,--it was because the dead man\\nhad dared to tell me that the wife I adored with all the passion of my\\nsoul was unfaithful to me.”\\n\\nWords of eager denial rose to the lips of the Countess; but her husband\\nwent on coldly, “And it was all true, for I heard all later on.\\n\\n“Poor Montlouis! _he_ was really loved. There was a little shop-girl,\\nwho toiled hard for daily bread, but she was a thousand times more\\nhonorable than the haughty woman of noble race that I had just married.”\\n\\n“Have mercy, Octave.”\\n\\n“Yes, and she fell a victim to her love for Montlouis. Had he lived,\\nhe would have made her his wife. After his death, she could no longer\\nconceal her fault. In small towns the people are without mercy; and when\\nshe left the hospital with her baby at her breast, the women pelted\\nher with mud. But for me,” continued the Count, “she would have died of\\nhunger. Poor girl! I did not allow her much, but with it she managed\\nto give her son a decent education. He has now grown up, and whatever\\nhappens, his future is safe.”\\n\\nHad M. de Mussidan and his wife been less deeply engaged in this hideous\\nrecital, they would have heard the stifled sobs that came from the\\nadjoining room.\\n\\nThe Count felt a certain kind of savage pleasure in venting the rage,\\nthat had for years been suppressed, upon the shrinking woman before him.\\n“Would it not be a cruel injustice, madame, to draw a comparison between\\nyou and this unhappy girl? Have you always been deaf to the whisperings\\nof conscience? and have you never thought of the future punishment\\nwhich most certainly awaits you? for you have failed in the duties of\\ndaughter, wife, and mother.”\\n\\nGenerally the Countess cared little for her husband’s reproaches, well\\ndeserved as they might be, but to-day she quailed before him.\\n\\n“With your entrance into my life,” continued the Count, “came shame and\\nmisfortune. When people saw you so gay and careless under the oak-trees\\nof your ancestral home, who could have suspected that your heart\\ncontained a dark secret? When my only wish was to win you for my wife,\\nhow did I know that you were weaving a hideous conspiracy against me?\\nEven when so young, you were a monster of dissimulation and hypocrisy.\\nGuilt never overshadowed your brow, nor did falsehood dim the frankness\\nof your eyes. On the day of our marriage I mentally reproached myself\\nfor any unworthiness. Wretched fool that I was, I was happy beyond all\\npower of expression, when you, madame, completed the measure of your\\nguilt by adding infidelity to it.”\\n\\n“It is false,” murmured the Countess. “You have been deceived.”\\n\\nM. de Mussidan laughed a grim and terrible laugh.\\n\\n“Not so,” answered he; “I have every proof. This seems strange to you,\\ndoes it? You have always looked upon me as one of those foolish husbands\\nthat may be duped without suspicion on their parts. You thought that\\nyou had placed a veil over my eyes, but I could see through it when you\\nlittle suspected that I could do so. Why did I not tell you this before?\\nBecause I had not ceased to love you, and this fatal love was stronger\\nthan all honor, pride, and even self-respect.” He poured out this\\ntirade with inconceivable rapidity, and the Countess listened to it in\\nawe-struck silence. “I kept silence,” continued the Count, “because I\\nknew that on the day I uttered the truth you would be entirely lost to\\nme. I might have killed you; I had every right to do so, but I could not\\nlive apart from you. You will never know how near the shadow of death\\nhas been to you. When I have kissed you, I have fancied that your lips\\nwere soiled with the kisses of others, and I could hardly keep my\\nhands from clutching your ivory neck until life was extinct, and failed\\nutterly to decide whether I loved you or hated you the most.”\\n\\n“Have mercy, Octave! have mercy!” pleaded the unhappy woman.\\n\\n“You are surprised, I can see,” answered he, with a dark smile; “yet\\nI could give you further food for wonder if I pleased, but I have said\\nenough now.”\\n\\nA tremor passed over the frame of the Countess. Was her husband\\nacquainted with the existence of the letters? All hinged upon this.\\nHe could not have read them, or he would have spoken in very different\\nterms, had he known the mystery contained in them.\\n\\n“Let me speak,” began she.\\n\\n“Not a word,” replied her husband.\\n\\n“On my honor--”\\n\\n“All is ended; but I must not forget to tell you of one of my youthful\\nfollies. You may laugh at it, but that signifies nothing. I actually\\nbelieved that I could gain your affection. I said to myself that one day\\nyou would be moved by my deep passion for you. I was a fool. As if love\\nor affection could ever penetrate the icy barriers that guarded your\\nheart.”\\n\\n“You have no pity,” wailed she.\\n\\nHe gazed upon her with eyes in which the pent-up anger of twenty years\\nblazed and consumed slowly. “And you, what are you? I drained to the\\nbottom the poisoned cup held out to a deceived husband by an unfaithful\\nwife. Each day widened the breach between us, until at last we sank into\\nthis miserable existence which is wearing out my life. I kept no watch\\non you; I was not made for a jailer. What I wanted was your soul and\\nheart. To imprison the body was easy, but your soul would still have\\nbeen free to wander in imagination to the meeting-place where your lover\\nexpected you. I know not how I had the courage to remain by your side.\\nIt was not to save an honor that had already gone, but merely to keep\\nup appearances; for as long as we were nominally together the tongue of\\nscandal was forced to remain silent.”\\n\\nAgain the unhappy woman attempted to protest her innocence, and again\\nthe Count paid no heed to her. “I wished too,” resumed he, “to save some\\nportion of our property, for your insatiable extravagance swallowed up\\nall like a bottomless abyss. At last your trades-people, believing me to\\nbe ruined, refused you credit, and this saved me. I had my daughter to\\nthink of, and have gathered together a rich dowry for her, and yet----”\\n he hesitated, and ceased speaking for a moment.\\n\\n“And yet,” repeated Madame de Mussidan.\\n\\n“I have never kissed her,” he burst forth with a fresh and terrible\\nexplosion of wrath, “without feeling a hideous doubt as to whether she\\nwas really my child.”\\n\\nThis was more than the Countess could endure.\\n\\n“Enough,” she cried, “enough! I have been guilty, Octave; but not so\\nguilty as you imagine.”\\n\\n“Why do you venture to defend yourself?”\\n\\n“Because it is my duty to guard Sabine.”\\n\\n“You should have thought of this earlier,” answered the Count with a\\nsneer. “You should have moulded her mind--have taught her what was noble\\nand good, and have perused the unsullied pages of the book of her young\\nheart.”\\n\\nIn the deepest agitation the Countess answered,--\\n\\n“Ah, Octave, why did you not speak of this sooner, if you knew all; but\\nI will now tell you everything.”\\n\\nBy an inconceivable error of judgment the Count corrected her speech.\\n“Spare us both,” said he. “If I have broken through the silence that I\\nhave maintained for many a year, it is because I knew that no word you\\ncould utter would touch my heart.”\\n\\nFeeling that all hope had fled, Madame de Mussidan fell backward\\nupon the couch, while Sabine, unable to listen to any more terrible\\nrevelations, had crept into her own chamber. The Count was about to\\nleave the drawing-room, when a servant entered, bearing a letter on\\na silver salver. De Mussidan tore it open; it was from M. de\\nBreulh-Faverlay, asking to be released from his engagement to Sabine de\\nMussidan. This last stroke was almost too much for the Count’s nerves,\\nfor in this act he saw the hand of the man who had come to him with\\nsuch deadly threats, and terror filled his soul as he thought of the\\nfar-stretching arm of him whose bondslave he found himself to be; but\\nbefore he could collect his thoughts, his daughter’s maid went into the\\nroom crying with all her might, “Help, help; my poor mistress is dying!”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\nFATHER AND DAUGHTER.\\n\\nVan Klopen, the man-milliner, knew Paris and its people thoroughly like\\nall tradesmen who are in the habit of giving large credit. He knew\\nall about the business of his customers, and never forgot an item of\\ninformation when he received one. Thus, when Mascarin spoke to him about\\nthe father of the lovely Flavia, whose charms had set the susceptible\\nheart of Paul Violaine in a blaze, the arbiter of fashion had replied,--\\n\\n“Martin Rigal; yes, I know him; he is a banker.” And a banker, indeed,\\nMartin Rigal was, dwelling in a magnificent house in the Rue Montmartre.\\nThe bank was on the ground floor, while his private rooms were in the\\nstory above. Though he did not do business in a very large way, yet\\nhe was a most respectable man, and his connection was chiefly with the\\nsmaller trades-people, who seem to live a strange kind of hand-to-mouth\\nexistence, and who might be happy were it not for the constant\\nreappearance of that grim phantom--bills to be met. Nearly all these\\npersons were in the banker’s hands entirely. Martin Rigal used his power\\ndespotically and permitted no arguments, and speedily quelled rebellion\\non the part of any new customer who ventured to object to his arbitrary\\nrules. In the morning the banker was never to be seen, being engaged in\\nhis private office, and not a clerk would venture to knock at his\\ndoor. Even had one done so, no reply would have been returned; for the\\nexperiment had been tried, and it was believed that nothing short of an\\nalarm of fire would have brought him out.\\n\\nThe banker was a big man, quite bald, his face was clean shaved, and\\nhis little gray eyes twinkled incessantly. His manner was charmingly\\ncourteous, and he said the most cruel things in the most honied accents,\\nand invariably escorted to the door the man whom he would sell up the\\nnext day. In his dress he affected a fashionable style, much used by the\\nmodern school of Shylocks. When not in business, he was a pleasant, and,\\nas some say, a witty companion. He was not looked on as an ascetic, and\\ndid not despise those little pleasures which enable us to sustain life’s\\ntortuous journey. He liked a good dinner, and had always a smile ready\\nfor a young and attractive face. He was a widower, and all his love\\nwas concentrated on his daughter. He did not keep a very extravagant\\nestablishment, but the report in the neighborhood was that Mademoiselle\\nFlavia, the daughter of the eminent banker, would one day come into\\nmillions. The banker always did his business on foot, for the sake of\\nhis health, as he said; but Flavia had a sweet little Victoria, drawn\\nby two thoroughbred horses, to drive in the Bois de Boulogne, under the\\nprotection of an old woman, half companion and half servant, who was\\ndriven half mad by her charge’s caprices. As yet her father has never\\ndenied her anything. He worked harder than all his clerks put together,\\nfor, after having spent the morning in his counting house over his\\npapers, he received all business clients.\\n\\nOn the day after Flavia and Paul Violaine had met at Van Klopen’s, M.\\nMartin Rigal was, at about half-past five, closeted with one of his\\nfemale clients. She was young, very pretty, and dressed with simple\\nelegance, but the expression of her face was profoundly melancholy.\\nHer eyes were overflowing with tears, which she made vain efforts to\\nrestrain.\\n\\n“If you refuse to renew our bill, sir, we are ruined,” said she. “I\\ncould meet it in January. I have sold all my trinkets, and we are\\nexisting on credit.”\\n\\n“Poor little thing!” interrupted the banker.\\n\\nHer hopes grew under these words of pity.\\n\\n“And yet,” continued she, “business has never been so brisk. New\\ncustomers are constantly coming in, and though our profits are small,\\nthe returns are rapid.”\\n\\nAs Martin Rigal heard her exposition of the state of affairs, he nodded\\ngravely.\\n\\n“That is all very well,” said he at last, “but this does not make the\\nsecurity you offer me of any more value. I have more confidence in you.”\\n\\n“But remember, sir, that we have thirty thousand francs’ worth of\\nstock.”\\n\\n“That is not what I was alluding to,” and the banker accompanied these\\nwords with so meaning a look, that the poor woman blushed scarlet and\\nalmost lost her nerve. “Your stock,” said he, “is of no more value in\\nmy eyes than the bill you offer me. Suppose, for instance, you were to\\nbecome bankrupt, the landlord might come down upon everything, for he\\nhas great power.”\\n\\nHe broke off abruptly, for Flavia’s maid, as a privileged person,\\nentered the room without knocking.\\n\\n“Sir,” said she, “my mistress wishes to see you at once.”\\n\\nThe banker got up directly. “I am coming,” said he; then, taking the\\nhand of his client, he led her to the door, repeating: “Do not worry\\nyourself; all the difficulties shall be got through. Come again, and we\\nwill talk them over;” and before she could thank him he was half way to\\nhis daughter’s apartment. Flavia had summoned her father to show him\\na new costume which had just been sent home by Van Klopen, and which\\npleased her greatly. Flavia’s costume was a masterpiece of fashionable\\nbad taste, which makes women look all alike and destroys all appearance\\nof individuality. It was a mass of frills, furbelows, fringes, and\\nflutings of rare hue and form, making a series of wonderful contrasts.\\nStanding in the middle of the room, with every available candle alight,\\nfor the day was fading away, she was so dainty and pretty that even the\\n_bizarre_ dress of Van Klopen’s was unable to spoil her appearance. As\\nshe turned round, she caught sight of her father in a mirror, panting\\nwith the haste he had made in running upstairs.\\n\\n“What a time you have been!” said she pettishly.\\n\\n“I was with a client,” returned he apologetically.\\n\\n“You ought to have got rid of him at once. But never mind that; look at\\nme and tell me plainly what you think of me.”\\n\\nShe had no need to put the question, for the most intense admiration\\nbeamed in his face.\\n\\n“Exquisite, delicious, heavenly!” answered he.\\n\\nFlavia, accustomed as she was to her father’s compliments, was highly\\ndelighted. “Then you think that he will like me?” asked she.\\n\\nShe alluded to Paul Violaine, and the banker heaved a deep sigh as he\\nreplied,--\\n\\n“Is it possible that any human being exists that you cannot please?”\\n\\n“Ah!” mused she, “if it were any one but he, I should have no doubts or\\nmisgivings.”\\n\\nMartin Rigal took a seat near the fire, and, drawing his daughter to\\nhim, pressed a fond kiss upon her brow, while she with the grace and\\nactivity of a cat, nestled upon his knee. “Suppose, after all, that he\\nshould not like me,” murmured she; “I should die of grief.”\\n\\nThe banker turned away his face to hide the gloom that overspread it.\\n“Do you love him, then, even now?” asked he.\\n\\nShe paused for a moment, and he added, “More than you do me?”\\n\\nFlavia pressed her father’s hand between both her palms and answered\\nwith a musical laugh, “How silly you are, papa! Why, of course I love\\nyou. Are you not my father? I love you too because you are kind and\\ndo all I wish, and because you are always telling me that you love me.\\nBecause you are like the cupids in the fairy stories--dear old people\\nwho give their children all their heart’s desire; I love you for my\\ncarriage, my horses, and my lovely dresses; for my purse filled with\\ngold, for my beautiful jewelry, and for all the lovely presents you make\\nme.”\\n\\nEvery word she spoke betrayed the utter selfishness of her soul, and yet\\nher father listened with a fixed smile of delight on his face.\\n\\n“And why do you love him?” asked he.\\n\\n“Because--because,” stammered the girl, “first, because he is himself;\\nand then,--well, I can’t say, but I _do_ love him.”\\n\\nHer accents betrayed such depth of passion that the father uttered a\\ngroan of anguish.\\n\\nFlavia caught the expression of his features, and burst into a fit of\\nlaughter.\\n\\n“I really believe that you are jealous,” said she, as if she were\\nspeaking to a spoiled child. “That is very naughty of you; you ought to\\nbe ashamed of yourself. I tell you that the first time I set eyes upon\\nhim at Van Klopen’s, I felt a thrill of love pierce through my heart,\\nsuch love as I never felt for a human being before. Since then, I have\\nknown no rest. I cannot sleep, and instead of blood, liquid fire seems\\nto come through my veins.”\\n\\nMartin Rigal raised his eyes to the ceiling in mute surprise at this\\noutburst of feeling.\\n\\n“You do not understand me,” went on Flavia. “You are the best of\\nfathers, but, after all, you are but a man. Had I a mother, she would\\ncomprehend me better.”\\n\\n“What could your mother have done for you more than I? Have I neglected\\nanything for your happiness?” asked the banker, with a sigh.\\n\\n“Perhaps nothing; for there are times when I hardly understand my own\\nfeelings.”\\n\\nIn gloomy silence the banker listened to the narrative of his daughter’s\\nstate of mind; then he said,--\\n\\n“All shall be as you desire, and the man you love shall be your\\nhusband.”\\n\\nThe girl was almost beside herself with joy, and, throwing her arms\\naround his neck, pressed kiss upon kiss on his cheeks and forehead.\\n\\n“Darling,” said she, “I love you for this more than for anything that\\nyou have given me in my life.”\\n\\nThe banker sighed again; and Flavia, shaking her pretty little fist at\\nhim, exclaimed, “What is the meaning of that sigh, sir? Do you by any\\nchance regret your promise? But never mind that. How do you mean to\\nbring him here without causing any suspicion?”\\n\\nA benevolent smile passed over her father’s face, as he answered,--\\n\\n“That, my pet, is my secret.”\\n\\n“Very well, keep it; I do not care what means you use, as long as I see\\nhim soon, very soon,--to-night perhaps, in an hour, or even in a few\\nminutes. You say Dr. Hortebise will bring him here; he will sit at our\\ntable. I can look at him without trouble, I shall hear his voice--”\\n\\n“Silly little puss!” broke in the banker; “or, rather, I should say,\\nunhappy child.”\\n\\n“Silly, perhaps; but why should you say unhappy?”\\n\\n“You love him too fondly, and he will take advantage of your feeling for\\nhim.”\\n\\n“Never; I do not believe it,” answered the girl.\\n\\n“I hope to heaven, darling, that my fears may never be realized. But he\\nis not the sort of husband that I intended for you; he is a composer.”\\n\\n“And is that anything against him!” exclaimed Flavia in angry tones;\\n“one would think from your sneers that this was a crime. Not only is he\\na composer, but he is a genius. I can read that in his face. He may be\\npoor, but I am rich enough for both, and he will owe all to me; so much\\nthe better, for then he will not be compelled to give lessons for his\\nlivelihood, and he will have leisure to compose an opera more beautiful\\nthan any that Gounod has ever written, and I shall share all his glory.\\nWhy, perhaps, he may even sing his own songs to me alone.”\\n\\nHer father noticed her state of feverish excitement and gazed upon her\\nsadly. Flavia’s mother had been removed from this world at the early\\nage of twenty-four by that insidious malady, consumption, which defies\\nmodern medical science, and in a brief space changes a beautiful girl\\ninto a livid corpse, and the father viewed her excited manner, flushed\\ncheeks, and sparkling eyes with tears and dismay.\\n\\n“By heavens!” cried he, bursting into a sudden fit of passion; “if ever\\nhe ill treats you, he is a dead man.”\\n\\nThe girl was startled at the sudden ferocity of his manner.\\n\\n“What have I done to make you angry?” asked she; “and why do you have\\nsuch evil thoughts of him?”\\n\\n“I tremble for you, in whom my whole soul is wrapped up,” answered the\\nbanker. “This man has robbed me of my child’s heart, and you will be\\nhappier with him than you are with your poor old father. I tremble\\nbecause of your inexperience and his weakness, which may prove a source\\nof trouble to you.”\\n\\n“If he is weak, all the better; my will can guide him.”\\n\\n“You are wrong,” replied her father, “as many other women have been\\nbefore you. You believe that weak and vacillating dispositions are\\neasily controlled, but I tell you that this is an error. Only determined\\ncharacters can be influenced, and it is on substantial foundations that\\nwe find support.”\\n\\nFlavia made no reply, and her father drew her closer to him.\\n\\n“Listen to me, my child,” said he. “You will never have a better friend\\nthan I am. You know that I would shed every drop of blood in my veins\\nfor you. He is coming, so search your heart to discover if this is not\\nsome mere passing fancy.”\\n\\n“Father!” cried she.\\n\\n“Remember that your happiness is in your own hands now, so be careful\\nand conceal your feelings, and do not let him discover how deep your\\nlove is for him. Men’s minds are so formed that while they blame a woman\\nfor duplicity, they complain far more if she acts openly and allows her\\nfeelings to be seen----”\\n\\nHe paused, for the door-bell rang. Flavia’s heart gave a bound of\\nintense joy.\\n\\n“He has come!” gasped she, and, with a strong effort to retain her\\ncomposure, she added, “I will obey you, my dear father; I will not come\\nhere again until I have entirely regained my composure. Do not fear, and\\nI will show you that your daughter can act a part as well as any other\\nwoman.”\\n\\nShe fled from the room as the door opened, but it was not Paul who made\\nhis appearance, but some other guests--a stout manufacturer and his\\nwife, the latter gorgeously dressed, but with scarcely a word to say for\\nherself. For this evening the banker had issued invitations to twenty of\\nhis friends, and among this number Paul would scarcely be noticed. He in\\ndue time made his appearance with Dr. Hortebise, who had volunteered to\\nintroduce him into good society. Paul felt ill at ease; he had just\\ncome from the hands of a fashionable tailor, who, thanks to Mascarin’s\\ninfluence, had in forty-eight hours prepared an evening suit of such\\nsuperior cut that the young man hardly knew himself in it. Paul had\\nsuffered a good deal from conflicting emotions after the visit to Van\\nKlopen’s, and more than once regretted the adhesion that he had given\\nto Mascarin’s scheme; but a visit the next day from Hortebise, and the\\nknowledge that the fashionable physician was one of the confederates,\\nhad reconciled him to the position he had promised to assume.\\n\\nHe was moreover struck with Flavia’s charms, and dazzled with the\\naccounts of her vast prospective fortune. To him, Hortebise, gay, rich,\\nand careless, seemed the incarnation of happiness, and contributed\\ngreatly to stifle the voice of Paul’s conscience. He would, however,\\nperhaps have hesitated had he known what the locket contained that\\ndangled so ostentatiously from the doctor’s chain.\\n\\nBefore they reached the banker’s door, driven in the doctor’s elegant\\nbrougham, a similar one to which Paul mentally declared he would have,\\nas soon as circumstances would permit, the young man’s mentor spoke.\\n\\n“Let me say a few words to you. You have before you a chance which is\\nseldom afforded to any young man, whatever his rank and social standing.\\nMind that you profit by it.”\\n\\n“You may be sure I will,” said Paul, with a smile of self-complacency.\\n\\n“Good, dear boy; but let me fortify your courage with a little of my\\nexperience. Do you know what an heiress really is?”\\n\\n“Well, really----”\\n\\n“Permit me to continue. An heiress and more so if she is an only child,\\nis generally a very disagreeable person, headstrong, capricious,\\nand puffed up with her own importance. She is utterly spoiled by the\\nflattery to which she has been accustomed from her earliest years, and\\nthinks that all the world is made to bend before her.”\\n\\n“Ah!” answered Paul, a little discomfited. “I hope it is not\\nMademoiselle Flavia’s portrait that you have been sketching?”\\n\\n“Not exactly,” answered the doctor, with a laugh. “But I must warn you\\nthat even she has certain whims and fancies. For instance, I am quite\\nsure that she would give a suitor every encouragement, and then repulse\\nhim without rhyme or reason.”\\n\\nPaul, who up to this time had only seen the bright side of affairs, was\\na good deal disconcerted.\\n\\n“Buy why should you introduce me to her then?”\\n\\n“In order that you may win her. Have you not everything to insure\\nsuccess? She will most likely receive you with the utmost cordiality;\\nbut beware of being too sanguine. Even if she makes desperate love to\\nyou, I say, take care; it may be only a trap; for, between ourselves,\\na girl who has a million stitched to her petticoats is to be excused if\\nshe endeavors to find out whether the suitor is after her or her money.”\\n\\nJust then the brougham stopped, and Dr. Hortebise and his young friend\\nentered the house in the Rue Montmartre, where they were cordially\\ngreeted by the banker.\\n\\nPaul glanced round, but there were no signs of Flavia, nor did she\\nmake her appearance until five minutes before the dinner hour, when the\\nguests flocked round her. She had subdued all her emotions, and not\\na quiver of the eyelids disclosed the excitement under which she was\\nlaboring. Her eye rested on Paul, and he bowed ceremoniously. The banker\\nwas delighted, for he had not believed much in her self-command. But\\nFlavia had taken his advice to heart, and when seated at table abstained\\nfrom casting a glance in Paul’s direction. When dinner was over and many\\nof the guests had sat down to whist; Flavia ventured to approach Paul,\\nand in a low voice, which shook a little in spite of her efforts,\\nsaid,--\\n\\n“Will you not play me one of your own compositions, M. Violaine?”\\n\\nPaul was but a medium performer, but Flavia seemed in the seventh\\nheaven, while her father and Dr. Hortebise, who had taken their seats\\nnot far away, watched the young couple with much anxiety.\\n\\n“How she adores him!” whispered the banker. “And yet I cannot judge of\\nthe effect that she has produced upon him.”\\n\\n“Surely Mascarin will worm it all out of him to-morrow,” returned the\\ndoctor. “To-morrow the poor fellow will have his hands full, for there\\nis to be a general meeting, when we shall hear all about Catenac’s\\nideas, and I shall be glad to know what Croisenois’s conduct will be\\nwhen he knows what he is wanted for.”\\n\\nIt was growing late, and the guests began to drop off. Dr. Hortebise\\nsignalled to Paul, and they left the house together. According to the\\npromise to her father, Flavia had acted her part so well, that Paul did\\nnot know whether he had made an impression or not.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\nMASTER CHUPIN.\\n\\nBeaumarchef, when Mascarin called a general meeting of his associates,\\nwas in the habit of assuming his very best attire; for as he was often\\ncalled into the inner office to answer questions, he was much\\nimpressed with the importance of the occasion. This time, however, the\\nsubordinate, although he had received due notice of the meeting, was\\nstill in his every-day dress. This discomposed him a good deal, though\\nhe kept muttering to himself that he meant no disrespect by it. Early in\\nthe morning he had been compelled to make up the accounts of two\\ncooks, who, having obtained situations, were leaving the servants’\\nlodging-house. When this matter was completed, he had hoped for half an\\nhour’s leisure. As he was crossing the courtyard, however, he fell in\\nwith Toto Chupin bringing in his daily report, which Beaumarchef thought\\nwould be what it usually was--a mere matter of form. He was, however,\\nmuch mistaken; for though outwardly Toto was the same, yet his ideas had\\ntaken an entirely new direction; and when Beaumarchef urged him to look\\nsharp, the request was received with a great deal of sullenness.\\n\\n“I ain’t lost no time,” said he, “and have fished up a thing or two\\nfresh; but before saying a word--”\\n\\nHe stopped, and seemed a little confused.\\n\\n“Well, go on.”\\n\\n“I want a fresh arrangement.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef was staggered.\\n\\n“Arrangement!” he echoed.\\n\\n“Of course you can lump it if yer don’t like it,” said the boy. “Do\\nyou think as how I’m going to work like a horse, and not get a wink of\\nsleep, just for a ‘thank ye, Chupin?’ No fear. I’m worth a sight more\\nnor that.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef flew into a rage.\\n\\n“Then you are not worth a pinch of salt,” said he.\\n\\n“All right, my cove.”\\n\\n“And you are an ungrateful young villain to talk like this after all the\\nkindness your master has shown you.”\\n\\nChupin gave a sarcastic laugh.\\n\\n“Goodness!” cried he. “To hear you go on, one would think that the boss\\nhad ruined himself for my sake.”\\n\\n“He took you out of the streets, and has given you a room ever since.”\\n\\n“A room, do you say? I call it a dog kennel.”\\n\\n“You have your breakfast and dinner every day regularly.”\\n\\n“I know that, and half a bottle of wine at each meal, which has so much\\nwater in it that it cannot even stain the tablecloth.”\\n\\n“You are an ungrateful young hound,” exclaimed Beaumarchef, “and forget\\nthat, in addition to this, he has set you up in business as a hot\\nchestnut seller.”\\n\\n“Good old business! I am allowed to stand all day under the gateway,\\nroasted on one side, and frozen on the other, and gain, perhaps twenty\\nsous.”\\n\\n“You know that in summer he has promised to set you up in the fried\\npotato line.”\\n\\n“Thank ye for nothing; I don’t like the smell of grease.”\\n\\n“What is it you want, then?”\\n\\n“Nothing. I feels that I ought to be a gentleman at large.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef cast a furious glance at the shameless youth, and told him\\nthat he would report everything to his master. The boy, however, did not\\nseem to care a pin.\\n\\n“I intends to see Master Mascarin myself presently,” remarked Chupin.\\n\\n“You are an idiot.”\\n\\n“Why so? Do you think I didn’t live better before I had anything to\\ndo with this blooming old cove? I never worked then. I used to sing in\\nfront of the pubs, and easily made my three francs a day. My pal and I\\nsoon check ‘em though, and then off we went to the theatre. Sometimes\\nwe’d make tracks for Ivry, and take our doss in a deserted factory, into\\nwhich the crushers never put their noses. In the winter we used to go to\\nthe glass houses and sleep in the warm ashes. All these were good times,\\nwhile now--”\\n\\n“Well, what have you to grumble at now? Don’t I hand you a five-franc\\npiece every day that you are at work?”\\n\\n“But that ain’t good enough. Come, don’t get shirty; all I asks is a\\nrise of salary. Only say either Yes or No; and if you say No, why, I\\nsends in my resignation.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef would have given a five-franc piece out of his own pocket\\nfor Mascarin to have heard the boy’s impertinence.\\n\\n“You are a young rascal!” said he, “and keep the worst of company. There\\nis no use in denying it, for a hang-dog fellow, calling himself Polyte,\\nhas been here asking after you.”\\n\\n“My company ain’t any business of yours.”\\n\\n“Well, I give you warning, you will come to grief.”\\n\\n“How?” returned Toto Chupin sulkily. “How can I come to grief? If old\\nMascarin interferes, I’ll shut up his mouth pretty sharp. I wish you and\\nyour master wouldn’t poke their noses into my affairs. I’m sick of you\\nboth. Don’t you think I’m up to you? When you make me follow some one\\nfor a week at a time, it isn’t to do ‘em a kindness, I reckon. If things\\nturn out badly, I’ve only to go before a beak and speak up; I should get\\noff easily enough then; and if I do so, you will be sorry for not having\\ngiven me more than my five francs a day.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef was an old soldier and a bold man, but he was easily upset,\\nfor the lad’s insolence made him believe that he was uttering words that\\nhad been put in his mouth by some wily adviser; and not knowing how\\nto act, the ex-soldier thought it best to adopt a more conciliating\\ndemeanor.\\n\\n“How much do you want?” asked he.\\n\\n“Well, seven francs to start with.”\\n\\n“The deuce you do! Seven francs a day is a sum. Well, I’ll give it you\\nmyself to-day and will speak about you to the master.”\\n\\n“You won’t get me to loosen my tongue for that amount to-day; you may\\nbet your boots on that,” answered the lad insolently. “I wants one\\nhundred francs down on the nail.”\\n\\n“One hundred francs,” echoed Beaumarchef, scandalized at such a demand.\\n\\n“Yes, my cove, that and no less.”\\n\\n“And what will you give in return? No, no, my lad; your demand is a\\npreposterous one; besides, you wouldn’t know how to spend such a sum.”\\n\\n“Don’t you flurry yourself about that; but of one thing you may be sure,\\nI sha’n’t spend my wages as you do--in wax for your mustache.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef could not endure an insult to his mustache, and Chupin was\\nabout to receive the kick he had so richly earned, when Daddy Tantaine\\nsuddenly made his appearance, looking exactly as he did when he visited\\nPaul in his garret.\\n\\n“Tut, tut; never quarrel with the door open.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef thanked Providence for sending this sudden reinforcement to\\nhis aid, and began in a tone of indignation,--\\n\\n“Toto Chupin--”\\n\\n“Stop! I have heard every word,” broke in Tantaine.\\n\\nOn hearing this, Toto felt that he had better make himself scarce; for\\nthough he hardly knew Mascarin, and utterly despised Beaumarchef, he\\ntrembled before the oily Tantaine, for in him he recognized a being who\\nwould stand no nonsense. He therefore began in an apologetic tone,--\\n\\n“Just let me speak, sir; I only wanted--”\\n\\n“Money, of course, and very natural too. Come, Beaumarchef, hand this\\nworthy lad the hundred francs that he has so politely asked for.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef was utterly stupefied, and was about to make some objection\\nwhen he was struck by a signal which Toto did not perceive, and, drawing\\nout his pocketbook, extracted a note which he offered to the lad. Toto\\nglanced at the note, then at the faces of the two men, but was evidently\\nafraid to take the money.\\n\\n“Take the money,” said Tantaine. “If your information is not worth the\\nmoney, I will have it back from you; come into the office, where we\\nshall not be disturbed.”\\n\\nTantaine took a chair, and glancing at Toto, who stood before him\\ntwirling his cap leisurely, said,--\\n\\n“I heard you.”\\n\\nThe lad had by this time recovered his customary audacity.\\n\\n“Five days ago,” he began, “I was put on to Caroline Schimmel; I have\\nfound out all about her by this time. She is as regular as clockwork in\\nher duties at least. She wakes at ten and takes her absinthe. Then she\\ngoes to a little restaurant she knows, and has her breakfast and a game\\nat cards with any one that will play with her. At six in the evening\\nshe goes to the Grand Turk, a restaurant and dancing-shop in the Rue des\\nPoisonnieres. Ain’t it a swell ken just! You can eat; drink, dance, or\\nsing, just as you like; but you must have decent togs on, or they won’t\\nlet you in.”\\n\\n“Wouldn’t they let you through then?”\\n\\nToto pointed significantly to his rags as he replied,--\\n\\n“This rig out wouldn’t pass muster, but I have a scheme in hand.”\\n\\nTantaine took down the address of the dancing-saloon, and then,\\naddressing Toto with the utmost severity,--\\n\\n“Do you think,” said he, “that this report is worth a hundred francs?”\\n\\nToto made a quaint grimace.\\n\\n“Do you think,” asked he, “that Caroline can lead the life she does\\nwithout money? No fear. Well, I have found out where the coin comes\\nfrom.”\\n\\nThe dim light in the office enabled Tantaine to hide the pleasure he\\nfelt on hearing these words.\\n\\n“Ah,” answered he carelessly, as if it was a matter of but little\\nmoment, “and so you have found out all that, have you?\\n\\n“Yes, and a heap besides. Just you listen. After her breakfast, my sweet\\nCarry began to play cards with some chaps who had been grubbing at the\\nnext table. ‘Regular right down card sharpers and macemen,’ said I\\nto myself, as I watched the way in which they faked the pasteboards.\\n‘They’ll get everything out of you, old gal.’ I was in the right, for in\\nless than an hour she had to go up to the counter and leave one of her\\nrings as security for the breakfast. He said he knew her, and would give\\nher credit. ‘You are a trump,’ said she. ‘I’ll just trot off to my own\\ncrib and get the money.’”\\n\\n“Did she go home?”\\n\\n“Not she; she went to a real swell house in a bang up part of Paris,\\nthe Rue de Varennes. She knocked at the door, and in she went, while I\\nlounged about outside.”\\n\\n“Do you know who lives there?”\\n\\n“Of course I do. The grocer round the corner told me that it was\\ninhabited by the Duke--what was his blessed name? Oh, the Duke----”\\n\\n“Was it the Duke de Champdoce?”\\n\\n“That is the right one, a chap they say as has his cellars chock full of\\ngold and silver.”\\n\\n“You are rather slow, my lad,” said Tantaine, with his assumed air of\\nindifference. “Get on a bit, do.”\\n\\nToto was much put out; for he had expected that his intelligence would\\nhave created an immense sensation.\\n\\n“Give a cove time to breathe in. Well, in half an hour out comes my\\nCarry as lively as a flea. She got into a passing cab and away she went.\\nFortunately I can run a bit, and reached the Palais Royal in time to\\nsee Caroline change two notes of two hundred francs each at the\\nmoney-changers.”\\n\\n“How did you find out that?”\\n\\n“By looking at ‘em. The paper was yellow.”\\n\\nTantaine smiled kindly. “You know a banknote then?”\\n\\n“Yes, but I have precious few chances of handling them. Once I went into\\na money-changer’s shop and asked them just to let me feel one, and they\\nsaid, ‘Get out sharp.’”\\n\\n“Is that all?” demanded Tantaine.\\n\\n“No; I have kept the best bit for a finish. I want to tell you that\\nthere are others on the lookout after Caroline.”\\n\\nToto had no reason this time to grumble at the effect he had produced,\\nfor the old man gave such a jump that his hat fell off.\\n\\n“What are you saying?” said he.\\n\\n“Simply that for the last three days a big chap with a harp on his back\\nhas been keeping her in view. I twigged him at once, and he too saw her\\ngo into the swell crib that you say belongs to that Duke.”\\n\\nTantaine pondered a little.\\n\\n“A street musician,” muttered he. “I must find out all about this. Now,\\nToto, listen to me; chuck Caroline over, and stick to the fellow with\\nthe harp; be off with you, for you have earned your money well.”\\n\\nAs Chupin went off, the old man shook his head.\\n\\n“Too sharp by a good bit,” said he; “he won’t have a long lease of\\nlife.”\\n\\nBeaumarchef was about to ask Tantaine to remain in the office while\\nhe went off to put on his best clothes, but the old man stopped this\\nrequest by saying,--\\n\\n“As M. Mascarin does not like to be disturbed, I will just go in without\\nknocking. When the other gentlemen arrive, show them in; for look you\\nhere, my good friend, the pear is so ripe that if it is not plucked, it\\nwill fall to the ground.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\nA TURN OF THE SCREW.\\n\\nDr. Hortebise was the first to arrive. It was a terrible thing for him\\nto get up so early; but for Mascarin’s sake he consented even to this\\ninconvenience. When he passed through the office, the room was full\\nof clients; but this did not prevent the doctor from noticing the\\nnegligence of Beaumarchef’s costume.\\n\\n“Aha!” remarked the doctor, “on the drunk again, I am afraid.”\\n\\n“M. Mascarin is within,” answered the badgered clerk, endeavoring to put\\non an air of dignity; “and M. Tantaine is with him.”\\n\\nA brilliant idea flashed across the doctor’s mind, but it was with an\\nair of gravity that he said,--\\n\\n“I shall be charmed to meet that most worthy old gentleman.”\\n\\nWhen, however, he entered the inner sanctum, he found Mascarin alone,\\noccupied in sorting the eternal pieces of pasteboard.\\n\\n“Well, what news?” asked he.\\n\\n“There is none that I know of.”\\n\\n“What, have you not seen Paul?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Will he be here?”\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\nMascarin was often laconic, but he seldom gave such short answers as\\nthis.\\n\\n“What is the matter?” asked the doctor. “Your greeting is quite\\nfunereal. Are you not well?”\\n\\n“I am merely preoccupied, and that is excusable on the eve of the battle\\nwe are about to fight,” returned Mascarin.\\n\\nHe only, however, told a portion of the truth; for there was more in\\nthe background, which he did not wish to confide to his friend. Toto\\nChupin’s revolt had disquieted him. Let there be but a single flaw in\\nthe axletree, and one day it will snap in twain; and Mascarin wanted to\\neliminate this flaw.\\n\\n“Pooh!” remarked the doctor, playing with his locket, “we shall succeed.\\nWhat have we to fear, after all,--opposition on Paul’s part?”\\n\\n“Paul may resent a little,” answered Mascarin disdainfully; “but I have\\ndecided that he shall be present at our meeting of to-day. It will be\\na stormy one, so be prepared. We might give him his medicine in minims,\\nbut I prefer the whole dose at once.”\\n\\n“The deuce you do! Suppose he should be frightened, and make off with\\nour secret.”\\n\\n“He won’t make off,” replied Mascarin in a tone which froze his\\nlistener’s blood. “He can’t escape from us any more than the cockchafer\\ncan from the string that a child has fastened to it. Do you not\\nunderstand weak natures like his? He is the glove, I the strong hand\\nbeneath it.”\\n\\nThe doctor did not argue this point, but merely murmured,--\\n\\n“Let us hope that it is so.”\\n\\n“Should we have any opposition,” resumed Mascarin, “it will come from\\nCatenac. I may be able to force him into co-operation with us, but his\\nheart will not be in the enterprise.”\\n\\n“Do you propose to bring Catenac into this affair?” asked Hortebise in\\ngreat surprise.\\n\\n“Assuredly.”\\n\\n“Why have you changed your plan?”\\n\\n“Simply because I have recognized the fact that, if we dispensed with\\nhis services, we should be entirely at the mercy of a shrewd man of\\nbusiness, because----”\\n\\nHe broke off, listened for a moment, and then said,--\\n\\n“Hush! I can hear his footstep.”\\n\\nA dry cough was heard outside, and in another moment Catenac entered the\\nroom.\\n\\nNature, or profound dissimulation, had gifted Catenac with an exterior\\nwhich made every one, when first introduced to him, exclaim, “This is an\\nhonest and trustworthy man.” Catenac always looked his clients boldly in\\nthe face. His voice was pleasant, and had a certain ring of joviality\\nin it, and his manner was one of those easy ones which always insure\\npopularity. He was looked upon as a shrewd lawyer; but yet he did not\\nshine in court. He must therefore, to make those thirty thousand francs\\na year which he was credited with doing, have some special line of\\nbusiness. He assayed rather risky matters, which might bring both\\nparties into the clutches of the criminal law, or, at any rate, leave\\nthem with a taint upon both their names. A sensational lawsuit is\\nbegun, and the public eagerly await the result; suddenly the whole thing\\ncollapses, for Catenac has acted as mediator. He has even settled the\\ndisputes of murderers quarreling over their booty. But he has even gone\\nfarther than this. More than once he has said of himself, “I have passed\\nthrough the vilest masses of corruption.” In his office in the Rue Jacob\\nhe has heard whispered conferences which were enough to bring down the\\nroof above his head. Of course this was the most lucrative business\\nthat passed into Catenac’s hands. The client conceals nothing from his\\nattorney, and he belongs to him as absolutely as the sick man belongs to\\nhis physician or the penitent to his confessor.\\n\\n“Well, my dear Baptiste,” said he, “here I am; you summoned me, and I am\\nobedient to the call.”\\n\\n“Sit down,” replied Mascarin gravely.\\n\\n“Thanks, my friend, many thanks, a thousand thanks; but I am much\\nhurried; indeed I have not a moment to spare. I have matters on my hands\\nof life and death.”\\n\\n“But for all that,” remarked Hortebise, “you can sit down for a moment.\\nBaptiste has something to say to you which is as important as any of\\nyour matters can be.”\\n\\nWith a frank and genial smile Catenac obeyed; but in his heart were\\nanger and an abject feeling of alarm.\\n\\n“What is it that is so important?” asked he.\\n\\nMascarin had risen and locked the door. When he had resumed his seat he\\nsaid,--\\n\\n“The facts are very simple. Hortebise and I have decided to put our\\ngreat plan into execution, which we have as yet only discussed generally\\nwith you. We have the Marquis de Croisenois with us.”\\n\\n“My dear sir,” broke in the lawyer.\\n\\n“Wait a little; we must have your assistance, and----”\\n\\nCatenac rose from his seat. “That is enough,” said he. “You have made a\\nvery great mistake if it is on this matter that you have sent for me; I\\ntold you this before.”\\n\\nHe was turning away, and looking for his hat, proposed to beat a\\nretreat; but Dr. Hortebise stood between him and the door, gazing upon\\nhim with no friendly expression of countenance. Catenac was not a man to\\nbe easily alarmed, but the doctor’s appearance was so threatening, and\\nthe smile upon Mascarin’s lips was of so deadly a character, that he\\nstood still, positively frightened into immobility.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” stammered he; “what is it you say now?”\\n\\n“First,” replied the doctor, speaking slowly and distinctly,--“first, we\\nwish that you should listen to us when we speak to you.”\\n\\n“I am listening.”\\n\\n“Then sit down again, and hear what Baptiste has to say.”\\n\\nThe command Catenac had over his countenance was so great that it was\\nimpossible to see to what conclusion he had arrived from the words and\\nmanner of his confederates.\\n\\n“Then let Baptiste explain himself,” said he.\\n\\n“Before entering into matters completely,” said he coolly, “I first want\\nto ask our dear friend and associate if he is prepared to act with us?”\\n\\n“Why should there be any doubt on that point?” asked the lawyer. “Do all\\nmy repeated assurances count as nothing?”\\n\\n“We do not want promises now; what we do want is good faith and real\\nco-operation.”\\n\\n“Can it be that you--”\\n\\n“I ought to inform you,” continued Mascarin, unheeding the interruption,\\n“that we have every prospect of success; and, if we carry the matter\\nthrough, we shall certainly have a million apiece.”\\n\\nHortebise had not the calm patience of his confederate, and exclaimed,--\\n\\n“You understand it well enough. Say Yes or No.”\\n\\nCatenac was in the agonies of indecision, and for fully a minute made no\\nreply.\\n\\n“_No_, then!” he broke out in a manner which betrayed his intense\\nagitation. “After due consideration, and having carefully weighed the\\nchances for and against, I answer you decidedly, No.”\\n\\nMascarin and Hortebise evidently expected this reply, and exchanged\\nglances.\\n\\n“Permit me to explain,” said Catenac, “what you consider as a cowardly\\nwithdrawal upon my part--”\\n\\n“Call it treachery.”\\n\\n“I will not quibble about words. I wish to be perfectly straightforward\\nwith you.”\\n\\n“I am glad to hear it,” sneered the doctor, “though that is not your\\nusual form.”\\n\\n“And yet I do not think that I have ever concealed my real opinion from\\nyou. It is fully ten years ago since I spoke to you of the necessity of\\nbreaking up this association. Can you recall what I said? I said only\\nour extreme need and griping poverty justified our acts. They are now\\ninexcusable.”\\n\\n“You talked very freely of your scruples,” observed Mascarin.\\n\\n“You remember my words then?”\\n\\n“Yes, and I remember too that those inner scruples never hindered you\\nfrom drawing your share of the profits.”\\n\\n“That is to say,” burst in the doctor, “you repudiated the work, but\\nshared the booty. You wished to play the game without staking anything.”\\n\\nCatenac was in no way disconcerted at this trenchant argument.\\n\\n“Quite true,” said he, “I always received my share; but I have done\\nquite as much as you in putting the agency in its present prosperous\\ncondition. Does it not work smoothly like a perfect piece of mechanism?\\nHave we not succeeded in nearly all our schemes? The income comes in\\nmonthly with extreme regularity, and I, according to my rights, have\\nreceived one-third. If you desire to throw up this perilous means of\\nlivelihood, say so, and I will not oppose it.”\\n\\n“You are really too good,” sneered the doctor, with a look of menace in\\nhis glance.\\n\\n“Nor,” continued Catenac, “will I oppose you if you prefer to let\\nmatters stand as they are; but if you start on fresh enterprises, and\\nembark on the tempestuous sea of danger, then I put down my foot and\\nvery boldly ‘halt.’ I will not take another step with you. I can see by\\nthe looks of both of you that you think me a fool and a coward. Heaven\\ngrant that the future may not show you only too plainly that I have been\\nin the right. Think over this. For twenty years fortune has favored us,\\nbut, believe me, it is never wise to tempt her too far, for it is well\\nknown that at some time or other she always turns.”\\n\\n“Your imagery is really charming,” remarked Hortebise sarcastically.\\n\\n“Good, I have nothing else to say but to repeat my warning: _reflect_.\\nGrand as your hopes and expectations may be, they are as nothing to the\\nperils that you will encounter.”\\n\\nThis cold flood of eloquence was more than the doctor could bear.\\n\\n“It is all very well for you,” exclaimed he, “to reason like this, for\\nyou are a rich man.”\\n\\n“I have enough to live on, I allow; for in addition to the income\\nderived from my profession, I have saved two hundred thousand francs;\\nand if you can be induced to renounce your projects, I will divide this\\nsum with you. You have only to think.”\\n\\nMascarin, who had taken no part in the dispute, now judged it time to\\ninterfere.\\n\\n“And so,” said he, turning to Catenac, “you have only two hundred\\nthousand francs?”\\n\\n“That or thereabouts.”\\n\\n“And you offer to divide this sum with us. Really we ought to be deeply\\ngrateful to you, but----”\\n\\nMascarin paused for a moment; then settling his spectacles more firmly,\\nhe went on,--\\n\\n“But even if you were to give us what you propose, you would still have\\neleven hundred thousand francs remaining!”\\n\\nCatenac burst into a pleasant laugh. “You are jesting,” said he.\\n\\n“I can prove the correctness of my assertion;” and as he spoke, Mascarin\\nunlocked a drawer, and taking a small notebook from it, turned over the\\npages, and leaving it open at a certain place, handed it to the lawyer.\\n\\n“There,” said he, “that is made up to December last, and shows precisely\\nhow you stand financially. Twice, then, you have increased your funds.\\nThese deposits you will find in an addenda at the end of the book.”\\n\\nCatenac started to his feet; all his calmness had now disappeared.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, “I have just the sum you name; and I, for that very\\nreason, refuse to have anything further to do with your schemes. I have\\nan income of sixty thousand francs; that is to say, sixty thousand good\\nreasons for receiving no further risks. You envy me my good fortune, but\\ndid we not all start penniless? I have taken care of my money, while\\nyou have squandered yours. Hortebise has lost his patients, while I have\\nincreased the number of my clients; and now you want me to tread the\\ndangerous road again. Not I; go your way, and leave me to go home.”\\n\\nAgain he took up his hat, but a wave of the hand from Mascarin detained\\nhim.\\n\\n“Suppose,” said he coldly, “that I told you that your assistance was\\nnecessary to me.”\\n\\n“I should say so much the worse for you.”\\n\\n“But suppose I insist?”\\n\\n“And how can you insist? We are both in the same boat, and sink or swim\\ntogether.”\\n\\n“Are you certain of that?”\\n\\n“So certain that I repeat from this day I wash my hands of you.”\\n\\n“I am afraid you are in error.”\\n\\n“How so?”\\n\\n“Because for twelve months past; I have given food and shelter to a girl\\nof the name of Clarisse. Do you by any chance know her?”\\n\\nAt the mention of this name, the lawyer started, as a man starts who,\\nwalking peacefully along, suddenly sees a deadly serpent coiled across\\nhis path.\\n\\n“Clarisse,” stammered he, “how did you know of her? who told you?”\\n\\nBut the sarcastic sneer upon the lips of his two confederates\\nwounded his pride so deeply, that in an instant he recovered his\\nself-possession.\\n\\n“I am getting foolish,” said he, “to ask these men how they learned my\\nsecret. Do they not always work by infamous and underhand means?”\\n\\n“You see I know all,” remarked Mascarin, “for I foresaw the day would\\ncome when you would wish to sever our connection, and even give us up to\\njustice, if you could do so with safety to yourself. I therefore took my\\nprecautions. One thing, however, I was not prepared for, and that was,\\nthat a man of your intelligence should have played so paltry a game,\\nand even twelve months back thought of betraying us. It is almost\\nincredible. Do you ever read the _Gazette des Tribunaux_? I saw in its\\npages yesterday a story nearly similar to your own. Shall I tell it to\\nyou? A lawyer who concealed his vices beneath a mantle of joviality and\\ncandor, brought up from the country a pretty, innocent girl to act as\\nservant in his house. This lawyer occupied his leisure time in leading\\nthe poor child astray, and the moment at last came when the consequences\\nof her weakness were too apparent. The lawyer was half beside himself at\\nthe approaching scandal. What would the neighbors say? Well, to cut the\\nstory short, the infant was suppressed,--you understand, suppressed, and\\nthe mother turned into the street.”\\n\\n“Baptiste, have mercy!”\\n\\n“It was a most imprudent act, for such things always leak out somehow.\\nYou have a gardener at your house at Champigny, and suppose the idea\\nseized upon this worthy man to dig up the ground round the wall at the\\nend of the garden.”\\n\\n“That is enough,” said Catenac, piteously. “I give in.”\\n\\nMascarin adjusted his spectacles, as he always did in important moments.\\n\\n“You give in, do you? Not a bit. Even now you are endeavoring to find a\\nmeans of parrying my home thrusts.”\\n\\n“But I declare to you----”\\n\\n“Do not be alarmed; dig as deeply as he might, your gardener would\\ndiscover nothing.”\\n\\nThe lawyer uttered a stifled exclamation of rage as he perceived the pit\\ninto which he had fallen.\\n\\n“He would find nothing,” resumed Mascarin, “and yet the story is all\\ntrue. Last January, on a bitterly cold night, you dug a hole, and in\\nit deposited the body of a new-born infant wrapped in a shawl. And what\\nshawl? Why the very one that you purchased at the _Bon Marche_, when you\\nwere making yourself agreeable to Clarisse. The shopman who sold it to\\nyou has identified it, and is ready to give evidence when called upon.\\nYou may look for that shawl, Catenac, but you will not find it.”\\n\\n“Have you got that shawl?” asked Catenac hoarsely.\\n\\n“Am I a fool?” asked Mascarin contemptuously. “Tantaine has it; but _I_\\nknow where the body is, and will keep the information to myself. Do not\\nbe alarmed; act fairly, and you are safe; but make one treacherous move,\\nand you will read in the next day’s papers a paragraph something to this\\neffect: ‘Yesterday some workmen, engaged in excavations near so-and-so,\\ndiscovered the body of a new-born infant. Every effort is being made\\nto discover the author of the crime.’ You know me, and that I work\\npromptly. To the shawl I have added a handkerchief and a few other\\narticles belonging to Clarisse, which will render it an easy matter to\\nfix the guilt on you.”\\n\\nCatenac was absolutely stunned, and had lost all power of defending\\nhimself. The few incoherent words that he uttered showed his state of\\nutter despair.\\n\\n“You have killed me,” gasped he, “just as the prize, that I have been\\nlooking for for twenty years, was in my grasp.”\\n\\n“Work does a man no harm,” remarked the doctor sententiously.\\n\\nThere was, however, little time to lose; the Marquis de Croisenois and\\nPaul might be expected to arrive at any moment, and Mascarin hastened to\\nrestore a certain amount of calmness to his prostrate antagonist.\\n\\n“You make as much noise as if we were going to hand you over to the\\nexecutioner on the spot. Do you think that we are such a pair of fools\\nas to risk all these hazards without some almost certain chance of\\nsuccess? Hortebise was as much startled as yourself when I first spoke\\nto him of this affair, but I explained everything fully to him, and now\\nhe is quite enthusiastic in the matter. Of course you can lay aside all\\nfear, and, as a man of the world, will bear no malice against those who\\nhave simply played a better game than yourself.”\\n\\n“Go on,” said Catenac, forcing a smile, “I am listening.”\\n\\nMascarin made a short pause.\\n\\n“What we want of you,” answered he, “will not compromise you in the\\nslightest degree. I wish you to draw up a document, the particulars\\nof which I will give you presently, and you will outwardly have no\\nconnection with the matter.”\\n\\n“Very good.”\\n\\n“But there is more yet. The Duke of Champdoce has placed a difficult\\ntask in your hands. You are engaged in a secret on his behalf.”\\n\\n“You know that also?”\\n\\n“I know everything that may be made subservient to our ends. I also know\\nthat instead of coming direct to me you went to the very man that we\\nhave every reason to dread, that fellow Perpignan, who is nearly as\\nsharp as we are.”\\n\\n“Go on,” returned Catenac impatiently. “What do you expect from me on\\nthis point?”\\n\\n“Not much; you must only come to me first, and report any discovery you\\nmay have made, and never give any information to the Duke without first\\nconsulting us.”\\n\\n“I agree.”\\n\\nThe contending parties seemed to have arrived at an amicable\\ntermination, and Dr. Hortebise smiled complacently.\\n\\n“Now,” said he, “shall we not confess, after all, that there was no use\\nin making such a fuss?”\\n\\n“I allow that I was in the wrong,” answered Catenac meekly; and,\\nextending his hands to his two associates with an oily smile, he said:\\n“Let us forget and forgive.”\\n\\nWas he to be trusted? Mascarin and the doctor exchanged glances of\\nsuspicion. A moment afterward a knock came to the door, and Paul\\nentered, making a timid bow to his two patrons.\\n\\n“My dear boy,” said Mascarin, “let me present you to one of my oldest\\nand best friends.” Then, turning to Catenac, he added: “I wish to ask\\nyou to help and assist my young friend here. Paul Violaine is a good\\nfellow, who has neither father nor mother, and whom we are trying to\\nhelp on in his journey through life.”\\n\\nThe lawyer started as he caught the strange, meaning smile which\\naccompanied these words.\\n\\n“Great heavens!” said he, “why did you not speak sooner?”\\n\\nCatenac at once divined Mascarin’s project, and understood the allusion\\nto the Duke de Champdoce.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\nSOME SCRAPS OF PAPER.\\n\\nThe Marquis de Croisenois was never punctual. He had received a note\\nasking him to call on Mascarin at eleven o’clock, and twelve had struck\\nsome time before he made his appearance. Faultlessly gloved, his glass\\nfirmly fixed in his eye, and a light walking cane in his hand, and with\\nthat air of half-veiled insolence that is sometimes affected by certain\\npersons who wish the world to believe that they are of great importance,\\nthe Marquis de Croisenois entered the room.\\n\\nAt the age of twenty-five Henry de Croisenois affected the airs and\\nmanners of a lad of twenty, and so found many who looked upon his\\nescapades with lenient eyes, ascribing them to the follies of youth.\\nUnder this youthful mask, however he concealed a most astute and cunning\\nintellect, and had more than once got the better of the women with whom\\nhe had had dealings. His fortune was terribly involved, because he had\\ninsisted on living at the same rate as men who had ten times his income.\\nForming one of the recklessly extravagant band of which the Duke de\\nSaumeine was the head, Croisenois, too, kept his racehorses, which\\nwas certainly the quickest way to wreck the most princely fortune. The\\nMarquis had found out this, and was utterly involved, when Mascarin\\nextended a helping hand to him, to which he clung with all the energy of\\na drowning man.\\n\\nWhatever Henry de Croisenois’ anxieties may have been on the day in\\nquestion, he did not allow a symptom of them to appear, and on his\\nentrance negligently drawled, “I have kept you waiting, I fear; but\\nreally my time is not my own. I am quite at your service now, and will\\nwait until these gentlemen have finished their business with you.” And\\nas he concluded, he again placed the cigar which he had removed while\\nsaying these words, to his lips.\\n\\nHis manner was very insolent, and yet the amiable Mascarin did not seem\\noffended, although he loathed the scent of tobacco.\\n\\n“We had begun to despair of seeing you, Marquis,” answered he politely.\\n“I say so, because these gentlemen are here to meet you. Permit me to\\nintroduce to you, Dr. Hortebise, M. Catenac of the Parisian bar, and our\\nsecretary,” pointing as he spoke, to Paul.\\n\\nAs soon as Croisenois had taken his seat, Mascarin went straight to the\\npoint, as a bullet to the target. “I do not intend,” began he, “to leave\\nyou in doubt for a moment. Beatings about the bush would be absurd among\\npersons like ourselves.”\\n\\nAt finding himself thus classed with the other persons present, the\\nMarquis gave a little start, and then drawled out, “You flatter me,\\nreally.”\\n\\n“I may tell you, Marquis,” resumed Mascarin, “that your marriage has\\nbeen definitely arranged by myself and my associates. All you have to do\\nis to get the young lady’s consent; for that of the Count and Countess\\nhas already been secured.”\\n\\n“There will be no difficulty in that,” lisped the Marquis. “I will\\npromise her the best horsed carriage in the Bois, a box at the opera,\\nunlimited credit at Van Klopen’s, and perfect freedom. There will be\\nno difficulty, I assure you. Of course, however, I must be presented by\\nsome one who holds a good position in society.”\\n\\n“Would the Viscountess de Bois Arden suit you?”\\n\\n“No one better; she is a relation of the Count de Mussidan.”\\n\\n“Good; then when you wish, Madame de Bois Arden will introduce you as a\\nsuitor for the young lady’s hand, and praise you up to the skies.”\\n\\nThe Marquis looked very jubilant at hearing this. “All right,” cried he;\\n“then that decides the matter.”\\n\\nPaul wondered whether he was awake or dreaming. He too had been promised\\na rich wife, and here was another man who was being provided for in the\\nsame manner. “These people,” muttered he, “seem to keep a matrimonial\\nagency as well as a servants’ registry office!”\\n\\n“All that is left, then,” said the Marquis, “is to arrange the--shall I\\ncall it the commission?”\\n\\n“I was about to come to that,” returned Mascarin.\\n\\n“Well, I will give you a fourth of the dowry, and on the day of my\\nmarriage will hand you a cheque for that amount.”\\n\\nPaul now imagined that he saw how matters worked. “If I marry Flavia,”\\n thought he, “I shall have to share her dowry with these highly\\nrespectable gentlemen.”\\n\\nThe offer made by the Marquis did not, however, seem to please Mascarin.\\n“That is not what we want,” said he.\\n\\n“No,--well, must I give you more? Say how much.”\\n\\nMascarin shook his head.\\n\\n“Well then, I will give you a third; it is not worth while to give you\\nmore.”\\n\\n“No, no; I would not take half, nor even the whole of the dowry. You may\\nkeep that as well as what you owe us.”\\n\\n“Well, but tell me what you _do_ want.”\\n\\n“I will do so,” answered Mascarin, adjusting his spectacles carefully;\\n“but before doing so, I feel that I must give you a short account of the\\nrise and progress of this association.”\\n\\nAt this statement Hortebise and Catenac sprang to their feet in surprise\\nand terror. “Are you mad?” said they at length, with one voice.\\n\\nMascarin shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Not yet,” answered he gently, “and I beg that you will permit me to go\\non.”\\n\\n“But surely we have some voice in the matter,” faltered Catenac.\\n\\n“That is enough,” exclaimed Mascarin angrily, “Am not I the head of this\\nassociation? Do you think,” he continued in tones of deep sarcasm, “that\\nwe cannot speak openly before the Marquis?”\\n\\nHortebise and the lawyer resignedly resumed their seats. Croisenois\\nthought that a word from him might reassure them.\\n\\n“Among honest men--” began he.\\n\\n“We are not honest men,” interrupted Mascarin. “Sir,” added he in a\\nsevere tone, “nor are you either.”\\n\\nThis plain speaking brought a bright flush to the face of the Marquis,\\nwho had half a mind to be angry, but policy restrained him, and he\\naffected to look on the matter as a joke. “Your joke is a little\\npersonal,” said he.\\n\\nBut Mascarin took no heed of his remark. “Listen to me,” said he, “for\\nwe have no time to waste, and do you,” he added, turning to Paul, “pay\\nthe greatest attention.”\\n\\nA moment of perfect silence ensued, broken only by the hum of voices in\\nthe outer office.\\n\\n“Marquis,” said Mascarin, whose whole face blazed with a gleam of\\nconscious power, “twenty-five years ago I and my associates were young\\nand in a very different position. We were honest then, and all the\\nillusions of youth were in full force; we had faith and hope. We all\\nthen tenanted a wretched garret in the Rue de la Harpe, and loved each\\nother like brothers.”\\n\\n“That was long, long ago,” murmured Hortebise.\\n\\n“Yes,” rejoined Mascarin; “and yet the effluxion of times does not\\nhinder me from seeing things as they then were, and my heart aches as I\\ncompare the hopes of those days with the realities of the present. Then,\\nMarquis, we were poor, miserably poor, and yet we all had vague hopes of\\nfuture greatness.”\\n\\nCroisenois endeavored to conceal a sneer; the story was not a very\\ninteresting one.\\n\\n“As I said before, each one of us anticipated a brilliant career.\\nCatenac had gained a prize by his ‘Treatise on the Transfer of Real\\nEstate,’ and Hortebise had written a pamphlet regarding which the great\\nOrfila had testified approval. Nor was I without my successes. Hortebise\\nhad unluckily quarrelled with his family. Catenac’s relatives were poor,\\nand I, well, I had no family. I stood alone. We were literally starving,\\nand I was the only one earning money. I prepared pupils for the military\\ncolleges, but as I only earned twenty-five sous a day by cramming a dull\\nboy’s brain with algebra and geometry, that was not enough to feed us\\nall. Well, to cut a long story short, the day came when we had not a\\ncoin among us. I forgot to tell you that I was devotedly attached to a\\nyoung girl who was dying of consumption, and who had neither food nor\\nfuel. What could I do? I knew not. Half mad, I rushed from the house,\\nasking myself if I had better plead for charity or take the money I\\nrequired by force from the first passer-by. I wandered along the\\nquays, half inclined to confide my sorrow to the Seine, when suddenly\\nI remembered it was a holiday at the Polytechnic School, and that if\\nI went to the _Café Semblon_ or the Palais Royal, I should most likely\\nmeet with some of my old pupils, who could perhaps lend me a few sous.\\nFive francs perhaps, Marquis,--that is a very small sum, but in that day\\nit meant the life of my dear Marie and of my two friends. Have you ever\\nbeen hungry, M. de Croisenois?”\\n\\nDe Croisenois started; he had never suffered from hunger, but how could\\nhe tell what the future might bring? for his resources were so nearly\\nexhausted, that even to-morrow he might be compelled to discard his\\nfictitious splendor and sink into the abyss of poverty.\\n\\n“When I reached the _Café Semblon_,” continued Mascarin, “I could not\\nsee a single pupil, and the waiter to whom I addressed my inquiries\\nlooked at me with the utmost contempt, for my clothes were in tatters;\\nbut at length he condescended to inform me that the young gentlemen had\\nbeen and gone, but that they would return. I said that I would wait for\\nthem. The man asked me if I would take anything, and when I replied in\\nthe negative, contemptuously pointed to a chair in a distant corner,\\nwhere I patiently took my seat. I had sat for some time, when suddenly a\\nyoung man entered the _café_, whose face, were I to live for a century,\\nI shall never forget. He was perfectly livid, his features rigid, and\\nhis eyes wild and full of anguish. He was evidently in intense agony of\\nmind or body. Evidently, however, it was not poverty that was oppressing\\nhim, for as he cast himself upon a sofa, all the waiters rushed forward\\nto receive his orders. In a voice that was almost unintelligible,\\nhe asked for a bottle of brandy, and pen, ink, and paper. In some\\nmysterious manner, the sight of this suffering brought balm to my aching\\nheart. The order of the young man was soon executed, and pouring out a\\ntumbler of brandy, he took a deep draught. The effect was instantaneous,\\nhe turned crimson, and for a moment almost fell back insensible. I kept\\nmy eyes on him, for a voice within me kept crying out that there was\\nsome mysterious link connecting this man and myself, and that his life\\nwas in some manner interwoven with mine, and that the influence he would\\nexercise over me would be for evil. So strongly did this idea become\\nrooted, that I should have left the _café_, had not my curiosity been so\\ngreat. In the meantime the stranger had recovered himself, and seizing\\na pen, scrawled a few lines on a sheet of paper. Evidently he was not\\nsatisfied with his composition, for after reading it over, he lit a\\nmatch and burnt the paper. He drank more brandy, and wrote a second\\nletter, which, too, proved a failure, for he tore it to fragments, which\\nhe thrust into his waistcoat pocket. Again he commenced, using\\ngreater care. It was plain that he had forgotten where he was, for he\\ngesticulated, uttered a broken sentence or two and evidently believed\\nthat he was in his own house. His last letter seemed to satisfy him, and\\nhe recopied it with care. He closed and directed it; then, tearing the\\noriginal into pieces, he flung it under the table; then calling the\\nwaiter, he said, ‘Here are twenty francs; take this letter to the\\naddress on the envelope. Bring the answer to my house; here is my card.’\\nThe man ran out of the room, and the nobleman, only waiting to pay his\\nbill, followed almost immediately. The morsels of white paper beneath\\nthe table had a strange fascination for me; I longed to gather them up,\\nto put them together, and to learn the secret of the strange drama that\\nhad been acted before me. But, as I have told you, then I was honest and\\nvirtuous, and the meanness of such an act revolted all my instincts; and\\nI should have overcome this temptation, had it not been for one of those\\ntrifling incidents which too often form the turning-point of a life.\\nA draught from a suddenly opened door caught one of these morsels of\\npaper, and wafted it to my feet. I stooped and picked it up, and read\\non it the ominous words, ‘blow out my brains!’ I had not been mistaken,\\nthen, and was face to face with some coming tragedy. Having once\\nyielded, I made no further efforts at self-control. The waiters were\\nrunning about; no one paid any attention to me; and creeping to the\\nplace that the unknown had occupied, I obtained possession of two more\\nscraps of paper. Upon one I read, ‘shame and horror!’ upon the other,\\n‘one hundred thousand francs by to-night.’ The meaning of these few\\nwords were as clear as daylight to me; but for all that, I managed to\\ncollect every atom of the torn paper, and piecing them together, read\\nthis:--\\n\\n“‘CHARLES,--‘I must have one hundred thousand francs to-night, and\\nyou are the only one to whom I can apply. The shame and horror of my\\nposition are too much for me. Can you send it me in two hours? As you\\nact, so I regulate my conduct. I am either saved, or I blow out my\\nbrains.’\\n\\n“You are probably surprised, Marquis, at the accuracy of my memory, and\\neven now I can see this scrawl as distinctly as if it were before me. At\\nthe end of this scrawl was a signature, one of the best known commercial\\nnames, which, in common with other financial houses, was struggling\\nagainst a panic on the Bourse. My discovery disturbed me very much. I\\nforgot all my miseries, and thought only of his. Were not our positions\\nentirely similar? But by degrees a hideous temptation began to creep\\ninto my heart, and, as the minutes passed by, assume more vivid color\\nand more tangible reality. Why should I not profit by this stolen\\nsecret? I went to the desk and asked for some wafers and a Directory.\\nThen, returning, I fastened the torn fragments upon a clean sheet of\\npaper, discovered the address of the writer, and then left the _café_.\\nThe house was situated in the Rue Chaussee d’Autin. For fully half an\\nhour I paced up and down before his magnificent dwelling-place. Was he\\nalive? Had the reply of Charles been in the affirmative? I decided at\\nlast to venture, and rang the bell. A liveried domestic appeared at my\\nsummons, and said that his master did not receive visitors at that hour;\\nbesides, he was at dinner. I was exasperated at the man’s insolence,\\nand replied hotly, ‘If you want to save your master from a terrible\\nmisfortune, go and tell him that a man has brought him the rough draft\\nof the letter he wrote a little time back at the _Café Semblon_.’ The\\nman obeyed me without a word, no doubt impressed by the earnestness of\\nmy manner. My message must have caused intense consternation, for in\\na moment the footman reappeared, and, in an obsequious manner, said,\\n‘Follow at once, sir; my master is waiting for you.’ He led me into a\\nlarge room, magnificently furnished as a library, and in the centre of\\nthis room stood the man of the _Café Semblon_. His face was deadly pale,\\nand his eyes blazed with fury. I was so agitated that I could hardly\\nspeak.\\n\\n“‘You have picked up the scraps of paper I threw away?’ exclaimed he.\\n\\n“I nodded, and showed him the fragments fastened on to the sheet of\\nnote-paper.\\n\\n“‘How much do you want for that?’ asked he. ‘I will give you a thousand\\nfrancs.’\\n\\n“I declare to you, gentlemen, that up to this time I had no intention\\nof making money by the secret. My intention in going had been simply to\\nsay, ‘I bring you this paper, of which some one else might have taken an\\nundue advantage. I have done you a service; lend me a hundred francs.’\\nThis is what I meant to say, but his behavior irritated me, and I\\nanswered,--\\n\\n“‘No, I want two thousand francs.’\\n\\n“He opened a drawer, drew out a bundle of banknotes, and threw them in\\nmy face.\\n\\n“‘Pay yourself, you villain!’ said he.\\n\\n“I can, I fear, never make you understand what I felt at this undeserved\\ninsult. I was not myself, and Heaven knows that I was not responsible\\nfor any crime that I might have committed in the frenzy of the moment,\\nand I was nearly doing so. That man will, perhaps, never see death so\\nnear him, save at his last hour. On his writing table lay one of those\\nCatalan daggers, which he evidently used as a paper-cutter. I snatched\\nit up, and was about to strike, when the recollection of Marie dying of\\ncold and starvation occurred to me. I dashed the knife to the ground,\\nand rushed from the house in a state bordering on insanity. I went into\\nthat house an honest man, and left it a degraded scoundrel. But I must\\nfinish. When I reached the street, the two banknotes which I had taken\\nfrom the packet seemed to burn me like coals of fire. I hastened to a\\nmoney-changer, and got coin for them. I think, from my demeanor, he\\nmust have thought that I was insane. With my plunder weighing me down,\\nI regained our wretched garret in the Rue de la Harpe. Catenac and\\nHortebise were waiting for me with the utmost anxiety. You remember that\\nday, my friends. Marquis, my story is especially intended for you. As\\nsoon as I entered the room, my friends ran up to me, delighted at seeing\\nme return in safety, but I thrust them aside.\\n\\n“‘Let me alone!’ cried I; ‘I am no longer fit to take an honest man’s\\nhand; but we have money, money!’ And I threw the bags upon the table.\\nOne of them burst, and a flood of silver coins rolled to every part of\\nthe room.\\n\\n“Marie started from her chair with upraised hands. ‘Money!’ she\\nrepeated, ‘money! we shall have food, and I won’t die.’\\n\\n“My friends, Marquis, were not as they are now, and they started back in\\nhorror, fearing that I had committed some crime.\\n\\n“‘No,’ said I, ‘I have committed no crime, not one, at least, that will\\nbring me within the reach of the strong arm of the law. This money is\\nthe price of our honor, but no one will know that fact but ourselves.’\\n\\n“Marquis, there was no sleeping in the garret all that night; but when\\ndaylight peered through the broken windows, it beamed on a table covered\\nwith empty bottles, and round it were seated three men, who, having cast\\naside all honorable scruples, had sworn that they would arrive at wealth\\nand prosperity by any means, no matter how foul and treacherous they\\nmight be. That is all.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\nAN INFAMOUS TRADE.\\n\\nMascarin, who was anxious to make as deep an impression as possible upon\\nCroisenois and Paul, broke off his story abruptly, and paced up and down\\nthe room. Had his intention been to startle his audience, he had most\\ncertainly succeeded. Paul was breathless with interest, and Croisenois\\nbroke down in attempting to make one of his usual trivial remarks. He\\nwas not particularly intelligent, except as regarded his self-interests,\\nand though, of course, he knew that there must be some connection\\nbetween his interests and the recital that Mascarin had just made, he\\ncould not for the life of him make out what it was. Mascarin seemed\\nutterly careless of the effect that he had produced. But the next time\\nthat his walk brought him to his desk he stopped, and, adjusting his\\nglasses, said, “I trust, Marquis, that you will forgive this long\\npreliminary address, which would really make a good sensational novel;\\nbut we have now arrived at the really practical part of the business.”\\n As he said these words, he took up an imposing attitude, with his elbow\\nresting on the mantelpiece.\\n\\n“On the night of which I have spoken, I and my friends released\\nourselves from all the bonds of virtue and honor, and freed ourselves\\nfrom all the fetters of duty to our fellow-men. The plan emanated from\\nmy brain complete in all its details in the will I made twenty years ago\\nto my friends. Marquis, as the summer goes on, you know that the ripest\\nand reddest cherries are the fullest flavored, just so, in the noblest\\nand wealthiest of families in Paris there is not one that has not some\\nterrible and ghostly secret which is sedulously concealed. Now, suppose\\nthat one man should gain possession of all of them, would he not be sole\\nand absolute master? Would he not be more powerful than a despot on\\nhis throne? Would he not be able to sway society in any manner he might\\nthink fit? Well, I said to myself, I will be that man!”\\n\\nEver since the Marquis had been in relation with Mascarin, he had\\nshrewdly suspected that his business was not conducted on really fair\\nprinciples.\\n\\n“What you mention,” said he, “is nothing but an elaborate and extended\\nsystem of blackmail.”\\n\\nMascarin bowed low, with an ironical smile on his face. “Just so,\\nMarquis, just so; you have hit on the very name. The word is modern, but\\nthe operation doubtless dates from the earliest ages. The day upon which\\none man began to trade upon the guilty secret of another was the date\\nof the institution of this line of business. If antiquity makes a thing\\nrespectable, then blackmailing is worthy of great respect.”\\n\\n“But, sir,” said the Marquis, with a flush upon his face, “but, sir--”\\n\\n“Pshaw!” broke in Mascarin, “does a mere word frighten you? Who has not\\ndone some of it in his time? Why, look at yourself. Do you not recollect\\nthis winter that you detected a young man cheating at cards? You said\\nnothing to him at the time, but you found out that he was rich, and,\\ncalling upon him the next day, borrowed ten thousand francs. When do you\\nintend to repay that loan?”\\n\\nCroisenois sank back in his chair, overcome with surprise at this\\ndisplay of knowledge on Mascarin’s part. “This is too terrible,”\\n muttered he, but Mascarin went on,--\\n\\n“I know, at least, two thousand persons in Paris who only exist by\\nthe exercise of this profession; for I have studied them all, from\\nthe convict who screws money out of his former companions, in penal\\nservitude, to the titled villain, who, having discovered the frailty of\\nsome unhappy woman, forces her to give him her daughter as his wife.\\nI know a mere messenger in the Rue Douai, who in five years amassed a\\ncomfortable fortune. Can you guess how? When he was intrusted with\\na letter, he invariably opened it, and made himself master of its\\ncontents, and if there was a compromising word in it, he pounced down\\nupon either the writer or the person to whom it was addressed. I also\\nknow of one large limited company which pays an annual income to a\\nscoundrel with half a dozen foreign orders, who has found out that they\\nhave broken their statutes of association, and holds proofs of their\\nhaving done so. But the police are on the alert, and our courts deal\\nvery severely with blackmailers.”\\n\\nMascarin went on: “The English, however, are our masters, for in London\\na compromising servant is as easily negotiable as a sound bill of\\nexchange. There is in the city a respectable jeweller, who will advance\\nmoney on any compromising letter with a good name at the foot. His shop\\nis a regular pawnshop of infamy. In the States it has been elevated\\nto the dignity of a profession, and the citizen at New York dreads the\\nblackmailers more than the police, if he is meditating some dishonorable\\naction. Our first operations did not bring in any quick returns, and the\\nharvest promised to be a late one; but you have come upon us just as\\nwe are about to reap our harvest. The professions of Hortebise and\\nCatenac--the one a doctor and the other a lawyer--facilitated our\\noperations greatly. One administered to the diseases of the body,\\nand the other to that of the purse, and, of course, thus they became\\nprofessors of many secrets. As for me, the head and chief, it would not\\ndo to remain an idle looker-on. Our funds had dwindled down a good deal,\\nand, after mature consideration, I decided to hire this house, and open\\na Servants’ Registry Office. Such an occupation would not attract any\\nattention, and in the end it turned out a perfect success, as my friends\\ncan testify.”\\n\\nCatenac and Hortebise both nodded assent.\\n\\n“By the system which I have adopted,” resumed Mascarin, “the wealthy\\nand respectable man is as strictly watched in his own house as is the\\ncondemned wretch in his cell; for no act of his escapes the eyes of the\\nservants whom we have placed around him. He can hardly even conceal his\\nthoughts from us. Even the very secret that he has murmured to his wife\\nwith closed doors reaches our ears.”\\n\\nThe Marquis gave a supercilious smile.\\n\\n“You must have had some inkling of this,” observed Mascarin, “for you\\nhave never taken a servant from our establishment; but for all that,\\nI am as well posted up in your affairs as yourself. You have even now\\nabout you a valet of whom you know nothing.”\\n\\n“Morel was recommended to me by one of my most intimate friends--Sir\\nRichard Wakefield.”\\n\\n“But for all that I have had my suspicions of him; but we will talk of\\nthis later, and we will now return to the subject upon which we have\\nmet. As I told you, I conceal the immense power I had attained through\\nour agency, and use it as occasion presents itself, and after twenty\\nyears’ patient labor, I am about to reap a stupendous harvest. The\\npolice pay enormous sums to their secret agents, while I, without\\nopening my purse, have an army of devoted adherents. I see perhaps fifty\\nservants of both sexes daily; calculate what this will amount to in a\\nyear.”\\n\\nThere was an air of complacency about the man as he explained the\\nworking of his system, and a ring of triumph in his voice.\\n\\n“You must not think that all my agents are in my secrets, for the\\ngreater part of them are quite unaware of what they are doing, and in\\nthis lies my strength. Each of them brings me a slender thread, which I\\ntwine into the mighty cord by which I hold my slaves. These unsuspecting\\nagents remind me of those strange Brazilian birds, whose presence is\\na sure sign that water is to be found near at hand. When one of them\\nutters a note, I dig, and I find. And now, Marquis, do you understand\\nthe aim and end of our association?”\\n\\n“It has,” remarked Hortebise quietly, “brought us in some years two\\nhundred and fifty thousand francs apiece.”\\n\\nIf M. de Croisenois disliked prosy tales, he by no means underrated the\\neloquence of figures. He knew quite enough of Paris to understand that\\nif Mascarin threw his net regularly, he would infallibly catch many\\nfish. With this conviction firmly implanted in his mind, he did not\\nrequire much urging to look with favor on the scheme, and, putting on a\\ngracious smile, he now asked, “And what must I do to deserve admission\\ninto this association?”\\n\\nPaul had listened in wonder and terror, but by degrees all feelings of\\ndisgust at the criminality of these men faded away before the power that\\nthey unquestionably possessed.\\n\\n“If,” resumed Mascarin, “we have up to this met with no serious\\nobstacles, it is because, though apparently acting rashly, we are in\\nreality most prudent and cautious. We have managed our slaves well, and\\nhave not driven any one to desperation. But we are beginning to weary\\nof our profession; we are getting old, and we have need of repose.\\nWe intend, therefore, to retire, but before that we wish to have\\nall matters securely settled. I have an immense mass of documentary\\nevidence, but it is not always easy to realize the value they represent,\\nand I wait upon your assistance to enable me to do so.”\\n\\nCroisenois’ face fell. Was he to take compromising letters round to\\nhis acquaintances and boldly say, “Your purse or your honor?” He had no\\nobjection to share the profits of this ignoble trade, but he objected\\nstrongly to showing his connection with it openly. “No, no,” cried he\\nhastily, “you must not depend upon me.”\\n\\nHe seemed so much in earnest that Hortebise and Catenac exchanged\\nglances of dismay.\\n\\n“Let us have no nonsense,” returned Mascarin sternly, “and wait a little\\nbefore you display so much fierceness. I told you that my documentary\\nevidence was of a peculiar kind. We very often had among our fish\\nmarried people who cannot deal with their personal property. A husband,\\nfor instance, will say, ‘I can’t take ten thousand francs without my\\nwife, knowing of it.’ Women say, ‘Why, I get all my money through my\\nhusband,’ and both are telling the truth. They kneel at my feet and\\nentreat me to have mercy, saying, ‘Find me some excuse for using a\\nportion of my funds and you shall have more than you ask.’ For a long\\ntime I have sought for this means, and at last I have found it in the\\nLimited Company, which you, Marquis, will float next month.”\\n\\n“Really!” returned the Marquis. “I do not see--”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon; you see it all clearly. A husband who cannot,\\nwithout fear of disturbing his domestic peace, put in five thousand\\nfrancs, can put in ten thousand if he tells his wife, ‘It is an\\ninvestment;’ and many a wife who has not any money of her own will\\npersuade her husband to bring in the money we require by the proposal to\\ntake shares. Now, what do you say to the idea?”\\n\\n“I think that it is an excellent one, but what part am I to play in it?”\\n\\n“In taking the part of Chairman of the Company. I could not do so, being\\nmerely the proprietor of a Servant’s Registry Office. Hortebise, as a\\ndoctor, and more than all a homeopath, would inspire no confidence, and\\nCatenac’s legal profession prevents him appearing in the matter openly.\\nHe will act as our legal adviser.”\\n\\n“But really I do not see anything about me that would induce people to\\ninvest,” remarked De Croisenois.\\n\\n“You are too modest; you have your name and rank, which, however we may\\nlook upon them, have a great effect upon the general public. There are\\nmany Companies who pay directors of rank and credible connection very\\nlargely. Before starting this enterprise you can settle all your debts,\\nand the world will then conclude that you are possessed of great wealth,\\nwhile, at the same time, the news of your approaching marriage with\\nMademoiselle du Mussidan will be the general talk of society. What\\nbetter position could you be in?”\\n\\n“But I have the reputation of being a reckless spendthrift.”\\n\\n“All the better. The day the prospectus comes out with your name at the\\nhead of it, there will be a universal burst of laughter. Men will say,\\n‘Do you see what Croisenois is at now? What on earth possessed him to go\\ninto Company work?’ But as this proceeding on your part will have paid\\nyour debts and given you Mademoiselle Sabine’s dowry, I think that the\\nlaugh will be on your side.”\\n\\nThe prospect dazzled Des Croisenois.\\n\\n“And suppose I accept,” asked he, “what will be the end of the farce?”\\n\\n“Very simple. When all the shares are taken up, you will close the\\noffice and let the Company look after itself.”\\n\\nCroisenois started to his feet angrily. “Why,” cried he, “you intend\\nto make a catspaw of me! Such a proceeding would send me to penal\\nservitude.”\\n\\n“What an ungrateful man he is!” said Mascarin, appealing to his\\naudience, “when I am doing all I can to prevent his going there.”\\n\\n“Sir!”\\n\\nBut Catenac now felt it time to interfere. “You do not understand,”\\n remarked he, addressing Croisenois. “You will start a Company for the\\ndevelopment of some native product, let us say Pyrenean marble, for\\ninstance, issue a prospectus, and the shares will be at once taken up by\\nMascarin’s clients.”\\n\\n“Well, what happens then?”\\n\\n“Why, out of the funds thus obtained we will take care when the crash\\ncomes to reimburse any outsiders who may have taken shares in the\\nconcern, telling them that the thing has been a failure, and that we are\\nruined; while Mascarin will take care to obtain from all his clients a\\ndischarge in full, so the Company will quietly collapse.”\\n\\n“But,” objected the Marquis, “all the shareholders will know that I am a\\nrogue.”\\n\\n“Naturally.”\\n\\n“They would hold me in utter contempt.”\\n\\n“Perhaps so, but they would never venture to let you see it. I never\\nthought that you would make objections; and whose character, however\\ndeep, will bear investigation?”\\n\\n“Are you sure that you hold your people securely?” asked he; “and that\\nnone of them will turn surly?”\\n\\nMascarin was waiting for this question, and taking from his desk the\\npieces of cardboard which he took so much pains to arrange, he replied,\\n“I have here the names of three hundred and fifty people who will each\\ninvest ten thousand francs in the Company. Listen to me, and judge for\\nyourself.”\\n\\nHe put all three pieces of cardboard together, and then drawing out one\\nhe read,--\\n\\n“‘N---, civil engineer. Five letters written by him to the gentleman\\nwho procured his appointment for him: worth fifteen thousand francs.’\\n\\n“‘P---, merchant. Absolute proof that his last bankruptcy was a\\nfraudulent one, and that he kept back from his creditors two hundred\\nthousand francs. Good for twenty thousand francs.’\\n\\n“‘Madame V---. A photograph taken in very light and airy costume. Poor,\\nbut can pay three thousand francs.’\\n\\n“‘M. H---. Three letters from her mother, proving that the daughter\\nhad compromised herself before marriage. Letter from a monthly nurse\\nappended. Can be made to pay ten thousand francs.’\\n\\n“‘X---, a portion of his correspondence with L--- in 1848. Three\\nthousand francs.’\\n\\n“‘Madame M. de M---. A true history of her adventure with M. J---.’”\\n\\nThis sample was quite sufficient to satisfy M. de Croisenois. “Enough,”\\n cried he, “I yield. I bow before your gigantic power, which utterly\\nsurpasses that of the police. Give me your orders.”\\n\\nBefore this Mascarin had conquered Hortebise and Paul Violaine, and now\\nhe had the Marquis at his feet. Many times during this conversation the\\nMarquis had more than once endeavored to make up his mind to withdraw\\nentirely from the business, but he had been unable to resist the strange\\nfascination of that mysterious person who had been laying bare his\\nscheme with such extraordinary audacity. The few vestiges of honesty\\nthat were still left in his corrupted soul revolted at the thought of\\nthe shameful compact into which he was about to enter, but the dazzling\\nprospect held out before his eyes silenced his scruples, and he felt a\\ncertain pride in being the associate of men who possessed such seemingly\\nillimitable power. Mascarin saw that there was no longer any necessity\\nfor the extreme firmness with which he had before spoken, and it was\\nwith the most studied courtesy that he replied: “I have no orders to\\ngive you, Marquis, our interests are identical, and we must all have a\\nvoice in the deliberations as to the best means of carrying them out.”\\n\\nThis change from _hauteur_ to suavity gratified Croisenois’ pride\\nimmensely.\\n\\n“Now,” continued Mascarin, “let us speak of your own circumstances. You\\nwrote to me recently that you had nothing, and I am aware that you have\\nno expectations for the future.”\\n\\n“Excuse me, but there is the fortune of my poor brother George, who\\ndisappeared so mysteriously.”\\n\\n“Let me assure you,” answered Mascarin, “that we had better be perfectly\\nfrank with each other.”\\n\\n“And am I not so?” answered the Marquis.\\n\\n“Why, in talking of this imaginary fortune?”\\n\\n“It is not imaginary; it is real, and a very large one, too, about\\ntwelve or fourteen hundred thousand francs, and I can obtain it, for, by\\nArticles 127 and 129 of the Code Napoleon---”\\n\\nHe interrupted himself, as he saw an expression of hardly-restrained\\nlaughter upon the features of Dr. Hortebise.\\n\\n“Do not talk nonsense,” answered Mascarin. “You could at first have\\nfiled an affidavit regarding your brother’s disappearance, and applied\\nto the Court to appoint you trustee, but this is now exactly what you\\nwish to avoid.”\\n\\n“Why not, pray? Do you think----”\\n\\n“Pooh, pooh, but you have raised so much money on this inheritance that\\nthere is nothing of it left hardly, certainly not sufficient to pay your\\ndebts. It is the bait you used to allure your tradespeople into giving\\nyou credit.”\\n\\nAt finding himself so easily fathomed, Croisenois burst into a peel of\\nlaughter. Mascarin had by this time thrown himself into an armchair, as\\nthough utterly worn out by fatigue.\\n\\n“There is no necessity, Marquis,” said he, “to detain you here longer.\\nWe shall meet again shortly, and settle matters. Meanwhile Catenac\\nwill draw up the prospectus and Articles of Association of the proposed\\nCompany, and post you up in the financial slang of which you must\\noccasionally make use.”\\n\\nThe Marquis and the lawyer at once rose and took their leave. As soon as\\nthe door had closed behind them, Mascarin seemed to recover his energy.\\n\\n“Well, Paul,” said he, “what do you think of all this?”\\n\\nLike all men with weak and ductile natures, Paul, after being almost\\nprostrated by the first discovery of his master’s villainy, had now\\nsucceeded in smothering the dictates of his conscience, and adopted a\\ncynical tone quite worthy of his companions.\\n\\n“I see,” said he, “that you have need of me. Well, I am not a Marquis,\\nbut you will find me quite as trustworthy and obedient.”\\n\\nPaul’s reply did not seem to surprise Mascarin, but it is doubtful\\nwhether he was pleased by it, for his countenance showed traces of a\\nstruggle between extreme satisfaction and intense annoyance, while the\\ndoctor was surprised at the cool audacity of the young man whose mind he\\nhad undertaken to form.\\n\\nPaul was a little disturbed by the long and continued silence of his\\npatron, and at last he ventured to say timidly,--\\n\\n“Well, sir, I am anxious to know under what conditions I am to be shown\\nthe way to make my fortune and marry Mademoiselle Flavia Rigal, whom I\\nlove.”\\n\\nMascarin gave a diabolical smile.\\n\\n“Whose dowry you love,” he observed. “Let us speak plainly.”\\n\\n“Pardon me, sir, I said just what I meant.”\\n\\nThe doctor, who had not Mascarin’s reasons for gravity, now burst into a\\njovial laugh.\\n\\n“And that pretty Rose,” said he, “what of her?”\\n\\n“Rose is a creature of the past,” answered Paul. “I can now see what an\\nidiot I was, and I have entirely effaced her from my memory, and I am\\nhalf inclined to deplore that Mademoiselle Rigal is an heiress, the more\\nso if it is to form a barrier between us.”\\n\\nThis declaration seemed to make Mascarin more easy.\\n\\n“Reassure yourself, my boy,” said he, “we will remove that barrier; but\\nI will not conceal from you that the part you have to play is much more\\ndifficult than that assigned to the Marquis de Croisenois; but if it is\\nharder and more perilous, the reward will be proportionately greater.”\\n\\n“With your aid and advice I feel capable of doing everything necessary,”\\n returned Paul.\\n\\n“You will need great self-confidence, the utmost self-possession, and as\\na commencement you must utterly destroy your present identity.”\\n\\n“That I will do with the utmost willingness.”\\n\\n“You must become another person entirely; you must adopt his name, his\\ngait, his behavior, his virtues, and even his failings. You must forget\\nall that you have either said or done. You must always think that you\\nare in reality the person you represent yourself to be, for this is the\\nonly way in which you can lead others into a similar belief. Your task\\nwill be a heavy one.”\\n\\n“Ah, sir,” cried the young man, enthusiastically, “can you doubt me?”\\n\\n“The glorious beam of success that shines ahead of you will take your\\nattention from the difficulties and dangers of the road that you are\\ntreading.”\\n\\nThe genial Dr. Hortebise rubbed his hands.\\n\\n“You are right,” cried he, “quite right.”\\n\\n“When you have done this,” resumed Mascarin, “we shall not hesitate to\\nacquaint you with the secret of the lofty destiny that awaits you. Do\\nyou understand me fully?”\\n\\nHere the speaker was interrupted by the entrance of Beaumarchef, who had\\nsignified his desire to come in by three distinct raps upon the door.\\nHe was now gorgeous to look upon, for having taken advantage of a spare\\nhalf hour, he had donned his best clothes.\\n\\n“What is it?” demanded Mascarin.\\n\\n“Here are two letters, sir.”\\n\\n“Thank you; hand them to me, and leave us.”\\n\\nAs soon as they were once more alone, Mascarin examined the letters.\\n\\n“Ah,” cried he, “one from Van Klopen, and the other from the Hotel de\\nMussidan. Let us first see what our friend the man-milliner has to say.\\n\\n“DEAR SIR,--\\n\\n“You may be at ease. Our mutual friend Verminet has executed your orders\\nmost adroitly. At his instigation Gaston de Gandelu has forged the\\nbanker Martin Rigal’s signature on five different bills. I hold them,\\nand awaiting your further orders regarding them, and also with respect\\nto Madame de Bois Arden,\\n\\n“I remain your obedient servant,\\n\\n“VAN KLOPEN.”\\n\\n\\nTossing it on the table, Mascarin opened the other letter, which he also\\nread aloud.\\n\\n“SIR,--\\n\\n“I have to report to you the breaking off of the marriage between\\nMademoiselle Sabine and M. de Breulh-Faverlay. Mademoiselle is very\\nill, and I heard the medical man say that she might not survive the next\\ntwenty-four hours.\\n\\n“FLORESTAN.”\\n\\n\\nMascarin was so filled with rage on learning this piece of news, which\\nseemed likely to interfere with his plans, that he struck his hand down\\nheavily on the table.\\n\\n“Damnation!” cried he. “If this little fool should die now, all our work\\nwill have to be recommenced.”\\n\\nHe thrust aside his chair, and paced hurriedly up and down the room.\\n\\n“Florestan is right,” said he; “this illness of the girl comes on at the\\ndate of the rupture of the engagement. There is some secret that we must\\nlearn, for we dare not work in the dark.”\\n\\n“Shall I go to the Hotel de Mussidan?” asked Hortebise.\\n\\n“Not a bad idea. Your carriage is waiting, is it not? You can go in your\\ncapacity as a medical man.”\\n\\nThe doctor was preparing to go, when Mascarin arrested his progress.\\n\\n“No,” said he, “I have changed my mind. We must neither of us be seen\\nnear the place. I expect that one of our mines has exploded; that the\\nCount and Countess have exchanged confidences, and that between the two\\nthe daughter has been struck down.”\\n\\n“How shall we find this out?”\\n\\n“I will see Florestan and try and find out.”\\n\\nIn an instant he vanished into his inner room, and as he changed his\\ndress, continued to converse with the doctor.\\n\\n“This blow would be comparatively trifling, if I had not so much on\\nhand, but I have Paul to look after. The Champdoce affair must be\\npressed on, for Catenac, the traitor, has put the Duke and Perpignan\\ninto communication. I must see Perpignan and discover how much has\\nbeen told him, and how much he has guessed. I will also see Caroline\\nSchimmel, and extract something from her. I wish to heaven that there\\nwere thirty-six hours in the day instead of only twenty-four.”\\n\\nBy this time he had completed his change of costume and called the\\ndoctor into his room.\\n\\n“I am off, now,” whispered he; “do not lose sight of Paul for a single\\ninstant, for we are not sufficiently sure of him to let him go about\\nalone with our secret in his possession. Take him to dine at Martin\\nRigal’s, and then make some excuse for keeping him all night at your\\nrooms. See me to-morrow.”\\n\\nAnd he went out so hurriedly that he did not hear the cheery voice of\\nthe doctor calling after him,--\\n\\n“Good luck; I wish you all good luck.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\nA FRIENDLY RIVAL.\\n\\nOn leaving the Hotel de Mussidan, M. de Breulh-Faverlay dismissed\\nhis carriage, for he felt as a man often does after experiencing some\\nviolent emotion, the absolute necessity for exercise, and to be alone\\nwith his thoughts, and by so doing recover his self-possession. His\\nfriends would have been surprised if they had seen him pacing hurriedly\\nalong the Champs Elysees. The usual calm of his manner had vanished, and\\nthe generally calm expression of his features was entirely absent. As he\\nwalked, he talked to himself, and gesticulated.\\n\\n“And this is what we call being a man of the world. We think ourselves\\ntrue philosophers, and a look from a pair of beautiful, pleading eyes\\nscatters all our theories to the winds.”\\n\\nHe had loved Sabine upon the day on which he had asked for her hand,\\nbut not so fondly as upon this day when he had learned that she could no\\nlonger be his wife, for, from the moment he had made this discovery, she\\nseemed to him more gifted and fascinating than ever. No one could have\\nbelieved that he, the idol of society, the petted darling of the women,\\nand the successful rival of the men, could have been refused by the\\nyoung girl to whom he had offered his hand.\\n\\n“Yes,” murmured he with a sigh, “for she is just the companion for life\\nthat I longed for. Where could I find so intelligent an intellect and\\nso pure a mind, united with such radiant beauty, so different from the\\nwomen of society, who live but for dress and gossip. Has Sabine anything\\nin common with those giddy girls who look upon life as a perpetual\\nvalue, and who take a husband as they do a partner, because they cannot\\ndance without one? How her face lighted up as she spoke of him, and how\\nthoroughly she puts faith in him! The end of it all is that I shall die\\na bachelor. In my old age I will take to the pleasures of the table, for\\nan excellent authority declares that a man can enjoy his four meals a\\nday with comfort. Well, that is something to look forward to certainly,\\nand it will not impair my digestion if my heirs and expectants come and\\nsquabble round my armchair. Ah,” he added, with a deep sigh, “my life\\nhas been a failure.”\\n\\nM. de Breulh-Faverlay was a very different type of man to that which\\nboth his friends and his enemies popularly supposed him to be. Upon the\\ndeath of his uncle, he had plunged into the frivolous vortex of Parisian\\ndissipation, but of this he had soon wearied.\\n\\nAll that he had cared for was to see the doings of his racehorse\\nchronicled in the sporting journals, and occasionally to expend a few\\nthousand francs in presents of jewelry to some fashionable actress. But\\nhe had secretly longed for some more honorable manner of fulfilling his\\nduties in life, and he had determined that before his marriage he would\\nsell his stud and break with his old associates entirely; and now this\\nwished-for marriage would never take place.\\n\\nWhen he entered his club, the traces of his agitation were so visible\\nupon his face, that some of the card-players stopped their game to\\ninquire if Chambertin, the favorite for the Chantilly cup, had broken\\ndown.\\n\\n“No, no,” replied he, as he hurriedly made his way to the writing-room,\\n“Chambertin is as sound as a bell.”\\n\\n“What the deuce has happened to De Breulh?” asked one of the members.\\n\\n“Goodness gracious!” remarked the man to whom the question was\\naddressed, “he seems in a hurry to write a letter.”\\n\\nThe gentleman was right. M. de Breulh was writing a withdrawal from his\\ndemand for Sabine’s hand to M. de Mussidan, and he found the task by\\nno means an easy one, for on reading it over he found that there was\\na valid strain of bitterness throughout it, which would surely attract\\nattention and perhaps cause embarrassing questions to be put to him.\\n\\n“No,” murmured he, “this letter is quite unworthy of me.” And tearing it\\nup, he began another, in which he strung together several conventional\\nexcuses, alleging the difficulty of breaking off his former habits and\\nof an awkward entanglement which he had been unable to break with, as\\nhe had anticipated. When this little masterpiece of diplomacy was\\ncompleted, he rang the bell, and, handing it to one of the club\\nservants, told him to take it to the Count de Mussidan’s house. When\\nthis unpleasant duty was over, M. de Breulh had hoped to experience some\\nfeeling of relief, but in this he was mistaken. He tried cards, but rose\\nfrom the table in a quarter of an hour; he ordered dinner, but appetite\\nwas wanting; he went to the opera, but then he did nothing but yawn, and\\nthe music grated on his nerves. At length he returned home. The day had\\nseemed interminable, and he could not sleep, for Sabine’s face was ever\\nbefore him. Who could this man be whom she so fondly loved and preferred\\nbefore all others? He respected her too much not to feel assured that\\nher choice was a worthy one, but his experience had taught him that when\\nso many men of the world fell into strange entanglements, a poor girl\\nwithout knowledge of the dangers around her might easily be entrapped.\\n“If he is worthy of her,” thought he, “I will do my best to aid her; but\\nif not, I will open her eyes.”\\n\\nAt four o’clock in the morning he was still seated musing before the\\nexpiring embers of his fire; he had made up his mind to see Andre--there\\nwas no difficulty in this, for a man of taste and wealth can find a\\nready excuse for visiting the studio of a struggling artist. He had no\\nfixed plan as to what he would say or do, he left all to chance, and\\nwith this decision he went to bed, and by two in the afternoon he drove\\nstraight to the Rue de la Tour d’Auvergne.\\n\\nAndre’s discreet portress was as usual leaning on her broom in the\\ngallery as M. de Breulh’s magnificent equipage drew up.\\n\\n“Gracious me!” exclaimed the worthy woman, dazzled by the gorgeousness\\nof the whole turnout; “he can’t be coming here, he must have mistaken\\nthe house.”\\n\\nBut her amazement reached its height when M. de Breulh, on alighting,\\nasked for Andre.\\n\\n“Fourth story, first door to the right,” answered the woman; “but I will\\nshow you the way.”\\n\\n“Don’t trouble yourself;” and with these words M. de Breulh ascended the\\nstaircase that led to the painter’s studio and knocked on the door. As\\nhe did so, he heard a quick, light step upon the stairs, and a young\\nand very dark man, dressed in a weaver’s blouse and carrying a tin pail\\nwhich he had evidently just filled with water from the cistern, came up.\\n\\n“Are you M. Andre?” asked De Breulh.\\n\\n“That is my name, sir.”\\n\\n“I wish to say a few words to you.”\\n\\n“Pray come in,” replied the young artist, opening the door of his studio\\nand ushering his visitor in. Andre’s voice and expression had made\\na favorable impression upon his visitor; but he was, in spite of his\\nhaving thrown aside nearly all foolish prejudices, a little startled at\\nhis costume. He did not, however, allow his surprise to be visible.\\n\\n“I ought to apologize for receiving you like this,” remarked Andre\\nquickly, “but a poor man must wait upon himself.” As he spoke, he threw\\noff his blouse and set down the pail in a corner of the room.\\n\\n“I rather should offer my excuse for my intrusion,” returned M. de\\nBreulh. “I came here by the advice of one of my friends;” he stopped for\\nan instant, endeavoring to think of a name.\\n\\n“By Prince Crescensi, perhaps,” suggested Andre.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” continued M. de Breulh, eagerly snatching at the rope the\\nartist held out to him. “The Prince sings your praises everywhere,\\nand speaks of your talents with the utmost enthusiasm. I am, on his\\nrecommendation, desirous of commissioning you to paint a picture for\\nme, and I can assure you that in my gallery it will have no need to be\\nashamed of its companions.”\\n\\nAndre bowed, coloring deeply at the compliment.\\n\\n“I am obliged to you,” said he, “and I trust that you will not be\\ndisappointed in taking the Prince’s opinion of my talent.”\\n\\n“Why should I be so?”\\n\\n“Because, for the last four months I have been so busy that I have\\nreally nothing to show you.”\\n\\n“That is of no importance. I have every confidence in you.”\\n\\n“Then,” returned Andre, “all that we have to do is to choose a subject.”\\n\\nAndre’s manner had by this time so captivated De Breulh that he muttered\\nto himself, “I really ought to hate this fellow, but on my word I like\\nhim better than any one I have met for a long time.”\\n\\nAndre had by this time placed a large portfolio on the table. “Here,”\\n said he, “are some twenty or thirty sketches; if any of them took your\\nfancy, you could make your choice.”\\n\\n“Let me see them,” returned De Breulh politely, for having made an\\nestimate of the young man’s character, he now wished to see what his\\nartistic talents were like. With this object in view he examined all\\nthe sketches in the portfolio minutely, and then turned to those on the\\nwalls. Andre said nothing, but he somehow felt that this visit would\\nprove the turning-point of his misfortunes. But for all that the young\\nman’s heart was very sad, for it was two days since Sabine had left\\nhim, promising to write to him the next morning regarding M. de\\nBreulh-Faverlay, but as yet he had received no communication, and he\\nwas on the tenterhooks of expectation, not because he had any doubt\\nof Sabine, but for the reason that he had no means of obtaining any\\ninformation of what went on in the interior of the Hotel de Mussidan.\\nM. de Breulh had now finished his survey, and had come to the conclusion\\nthat though many of Andre’s productions were crude and lacking in\\nfinish, yet that he had the true artistic metal in him. He extended his\\nhand to the young man and said forcibly, “I am no longer influenced by\\nthe opinion of a friend. I have seen and judged for myself, and am more\\ndesirous than ever of possessing one of your pictures. I have made my\\nchoice of a subject, and now let us discuss the details.”\\n\\nAs he spoke he handed a little sketch to Andre. It was a view of\\neveryday life, which the painter had entitled, “Outside the Barrier.”\\n Two men with torn garments and wine-flushed faces were struggling in\\ntipsy combat, while on the right hand side of the picture lay a woman,\\nbleeding profusely from a cut on the forehead, and two of her terrified\\ncompanions were bending over her, endeavoring to restore her to\\nconsciousness. In the background were some flying figures, who were\\nhastening up to separate the combatants. The sketch was one of real\\nlife, denuded of any sham element of romance, and this was the one that\\nM. de Breulh had chosen. The two men discussed the size of the picture,\\nand not a single detail was omitted.\\n\\n“I am sure that you will do all that is right,” remarked De Breulh. “Let\\nyour own inspiration guide you, and all will be well.” In reality he was\\ndying to get away, for he felt in what a false position he was, and with\\na violent effort he approached the money part of the matter.\\n\\n“Monsieur,” said Andre, “it is impossible to fix a price; when\\ncompleted, a picture may only be worth the canvas that it is painted on,\\nor else beyond all price. Let us wait.”\\n\\n“Well,” broke in M. de Breulh, “what do you say to ten thousand francs?”\\n\\n“Too much,” returned Andre with a deprecatory wave of his hand; “far\\ntoo much. If I succeed in it, as I hope to do, I will ask six thousand\\nfrancs for it.”\\n\\n“Agreed!” answered De Breulh, taking from his pocket an elegant\\nnote-case with his crest and monogram upon it and extracting from it\\nthree thousand francs. “I will, as is usual, deposit half the price in\\nadvance.”\\n\\nAndre blushed scarlet. “You are joking,” said he.\\n\\n“Not at all,” answered De Breulh quietly; “I have my own way of doing\\nbusiness, from which I never deviate.”\\n\\nIn spite of this answer Andre’s pride was hurt.\\n\\n“But,” remarked he, “this picture will not be ready for perhaps six or\\nseven months. I have entered into a contract with a wealthy builder,\\nnamed Candele, to execute the outside decorations of his house.”\\n\\n“Never mind that,” answered M. de Breulh; “take as long as you like.”\\n\\nOf course, after this, Andre could offer no further opposition; he\\ntherefore took the money without another word.\\n\\n“And now,” said De Breulh, as he paused for a moment at the open\\ndoorway, “let me wish you my good luck, and if you will come and\\nbreakfast with me one day, I think I can show you some pictures which\\nyou will really appreciate.” And handing his card to the artist, he went\\ndownstairs.\\n\\nAt first Andre did not glance at the card, but when he did so, the\\nletters seemed to sear his eyeballs like a red-hot iron. For a moment\\nhe could hardly breathe, and then a feeling of intense anger took\\npossession of him, for he felt that he had been trifled with and\\ndeceived.\\n\\nHardly knowing what he was doing, he rushed out on the landing, and,\\nleaning over the banister, called out loudly, “Sir, stop a moment!”\\n\\nDe Breulh, who had by this time reached the bottom of the staircase,\\nturned round.\\n\\n“Come back, if you please,” said Andre.\\n\\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, De Breulh obeyed; and when he was again\\nin the studio, Andre addressed him in a voice that quivered with\\nindignation.\\n\\n“Take back these notes, sir; I will not accept them.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Only that I have thought the matter over, and that I will not accept\\nyour commission.”\\n\\n“And why this sudden change?”\\n\\n“You know perfectly well, M. de Breulh-Faverlay.”\\n\\nThe gentleman at once saw that Sabine had mentioned his name to the\\nyoung artist, and with a slight lacking of generous feeling said,--\\n\\n“Let me hear your reasons, sir.”\\n\\n“Because, because----” stammered the young man.\\n\\n“Because is not an answer.”\\n\\nAndre’s confusion became greater. He would not tell the whole truth, for\\nhe would have died sooner than bring Sabine’s name into the discussion;\\nand he could only see one way out of his difficulty.\\n\\n“Suppose I say that I do not like your manner or appearance,” returned\\nhe disdainfully.\\n\\n“Is it your wish to insult me, M. Andre?”\\n\\n“As you choose to take it.”\\n\\nM. de Breulh was not gifted with an immense stock of patience. He turned\\nlivid, and made a step forward; but his generous impulses restrained\\nhim, and it was in a voice broken by agitation that he said,--\\n\\n“Accept my apologies, M. Andre; I fear that I have played a part\\nunworthy of you and of myself. I ought to have given you my name at\\nonce. I know everything.”\\n\\n“I do not comprehend you,” answered Andre in a glacial voice.\\n\\n“Why doubt, then, if you do not understand? However, I have given you\\ncause to do so. But, let me reassure you, Mademoiselle Sabine has spoken\\nto me with the utmost frankness; and, if you still distrust me, let me\\ntell you that this veiled picture is her portrait. I will say\\nmore,” continued De Breulh gravely, as the artist still kept silent;\\n“yesterday, at Mademoiselle de Mussidan’s request, I withdrew from my\\nposition as a suitor for her hand.”\\n\\nAndre had already been touched by De Breulh’s frank and open manner, and\\nthese last words entirely conquered him.\\n\\n“I can never thank you enough,” began he.\\n\\nBut De Breulh interrupted him.\\n\\n“A man should not be thanked for performing his duty. I should lie to\\nyou if I said that I am not painfully surprised at her communication;\\nbut tell me, had you been in my place, would you not have acted in the\\nsame manner?”\\n\\n“I think that I should.”\\n\\n“And now we are friends, are we not?” and again De Breulh held out his\\nhand, which Andre clasped with enthusiasm.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” faltered he.\\n\\n“And now,” continued De Breulh, with a forced smile, “let us say no more\\nabout the picture, which was, after all, merely a pretext. As I came\\nhere I said to myself, ‘If the man to whom Mademoiselle de Mussidan has\\ngiven her heart is worthy of her, I will do all I can to advance his\\nsuit with her family!’ I came here to see what you were like; and now\\nI say to you, do me a great honor, and permit me to place myself, my\\nfortune, and the influence of my friends, at your disposal.”\\n\\nThe offer was made in perfect good faith, but Andre shook his head.\\n\\n“I shall never forget your kindness in making this offer, but----“; he\\npaused for a moment, and then went on: “I will be as open as you have\\nbeen, and will tell you the whole truth. You may think me foolish; but\\nremember, though I am poor, I have still my self-respect to maintain. I\\nlove Sabine, and would give my life for her. Do not be offended at what\\nI am about to say. I would, however, sooner give up her hand than be\\nindebted for it to you.”\\n\\n“But this is mere madness.”\\n\\n“No, sir, it is the purest wisdom; for were I to accede to your wishes,\\nI should feel deeply humiliated by the thought of your self-denial; for\\nI should be madly jealous of the part you were playing. You are of high\\nbirth and princely fortune, while I am utterly friendless and unknown;\\nall that I am deficient in you possess.”\\n\\n“But I have been poor myself,” interposed De Breulh, “and perhaps\\nendured even greater miseries than ever you have done. Do you know what\\nI was doing at your age? I was slowly starving to death at Sonora, and\\nhad to take the humblest position in a cattle ranch. Do you think that\\nthose days taught me nothing?”\\n\\n“You will be able to judge me all the more clearly then,” returned\\nAndre. “If I raise myself up to Sabine’s level, as she begged me to,\\nthen I shall feel that I am your equal; but if I accept your aid, I am\\nyour dependent; and I will obey her wishes or perish in the effort.”\\n\\nUp to this moment the passion which stirred Andre’s inmost soul had\\nbreathed in every word he uttered; but, checking himself by a mighty\\neffort, he resumed in a tone of greater calmness,--\\n\\n“But I ought to remember how much we already owe you, and I hope that\\nyou will allow me to call myself your friend?”\\n\\nM. de Breulh’s noble nature enabled him to understand Andre’s scruples;\\nhis feelings, however, would not for the instant enable him to speak.\\nHe slowly put the notes back in their receptacle, and then said in a low\\nvoice,--\\n\\n“Your conduct is that of an honorable man; and remember this, at all\\ntimes and seasons you may rely upon De Breulh-Faverlay. Farewell!”\\n\\nAs soon as he was alone, Andre threw himself into an armchair, and mused\\nover this unexpected interview, which had proved a source of such solace\\nto his feelings. All that he now longed for was a letter from Sabine.\\nAt this moment the portress entered with a letter. Andre was so occupied\\nwith his thoughts that he hardly noticed this act of condescension on\\nthe part of the worthy woman.\\n\\n“A letter!” exclaimed he; and, tearing it open, he glanced at the\\nsignature. But Sabine’s name was not there; it was signed Modeste.\\nWhat could Sabine’s maid have to say to him? He felt that some great\\nmisfortune was impending, and, trembling with excitement, he read the\\nletter.\\n\\n“SIR,--\\n\\n“I write to tell you that my mistress has succeeded in the matter she\\nspoke of to you; but I am sorry to say that I have bad news to give you,\\nfor she is seriously ill.”\\n\\n“Ill!” exclaimed Andre, crushing up the letter in his hands, and dashing\\nit upon the floor. “Ill! ill!” he repeated, not heeding the presence\\nof the portress; “why, she may be dead;” and, snatching up his hat, he\\ndashed downstairs into the street.\\n\\nAs soon as the portress was left alone, she picked up the letter,\\nsmoothed it out, and read it.\\n\\n“And so,” murmured she, “the little lady’s name was Sabine--a pretty\\nname; and she is ill, is she? I expect that the old gent who called this\\nmorning, and asked so many questions about M. Andre, would give a good\\ndeal for this note; but no, that would not be fair.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\nA COUNCIL OF WAR.\\n\\nMad with his terrible forebodings, Andre hurried through the streets in\\nthe direction of the Hotel de Mussidan, caring little for the attention\\nthat his excited looks and gestures caused. He had no fixed plan as to\\nwhat to do when he arrived there, and it was only on reaching the Rue\\nde Matignon that he recovered sufficient coolness to deliberate and\\nreflect.\\n\\nHe had arrived at the desired spot; how should he set to work to obtain\\nthe information that he required? The evening was a dark one, and the\\ngas-lamps showed a feeble light through the dull February fog. There\\nwere no signs of life in the Rue de Matignon, and the silence was only\\nbroken by the continuous surge of carriage wheels in the Faubourg Saint\\nHonore. This gloom, and the inclemency of the weather, added to the\\nyoung painter’s depression. He saw his utter helplessness, and felt\\nthat he could not move a step without compromising the woman he so\\nmadly adored. He walked to the gate of the house, hoping to gain some\\ninformation even from the exterior aspect of the house; for it seemed to\\nhim that if Sabine were dying, the very stones in the street would utter\\nsounds of woe and lamentation; but the fog had closely enwrapped the\\nhouse, and he could hardly see which of the windows were lighted. His\\nreasoning faculties told him that there was no use in waiting, but an\\ninner voice warned him to stay. Would Modeste, who had written to him,\\ndivine, by some means that he was there, in an agony of suspense, and\\ncome out to give him information and solace? All at once a thought\\ndarted across his mind, vivid as a flash of lightning.\\n\\n“M. de Breulh will help me,” cried he; “for though I cannot go to the\\nhouse, he will have no difficulty in doing so.”\\n\\nBy good luck, he had M. de Breulh’s card in his pocket, and hurried\\noff to his address. M. de Breulh had a fine house in the Avenue de\\nl’Imperatrice, which he had taken more for the commodiousness of the\\nstables than for his own convenience.\\n\\n“I wish to see M. de Breulh,” said Andre, as he stopped breathless at\\nthe door, where a couple of footmen were chatting.\\n\\nThe men looked at him with supreme contempt. “He is out,” one of them at\\nlast condescended to reply.\\n\\nAndre had by this time recovered his coolness, and taking out De\\nBreulh’s card, wrote these words on it in pencil: “One moment’s\\ninterview. ANDRE.”\\n\\n“Give this to your master as soon as he comes in,” said he.\\n\\nThen he descended the steps slowly. He was certain that M. de Breulh was\\nin the house, and that he would send out after the person who had left\\nthe card almost at once. His conclusion proved right; in five minutes\\nhe was overtaken by the panting lackey, who, conducting him back to\\nthe house, showed him into a magnificently furnished library. De Breulh\\nfeared that some terrible event had taken place.\\n\\n“What has happened?” said he.\\n\\n“Sabine is dying;” and Andre at once proceeded to inform De Breulh of\\nwhat had happened since his departure.\\n\\n“But how can I help you?”\\n\\n“You can go and make inquiries at the house.”\\n\\n“Reflect; yesterday I wrote to the Count, and broke off a marriage,\\nthe preliminaries of which had been completely settled; and within\\ntwenty-four hours to send and inquire after his daughter’s health would\\nbe to be guilty of an act of inexcusable insolence; for it would look\\nas if I fancied that Mademoiselle de Mussidan had been struck down by my\\nrupture of the engagement.”\\n\\n“You are right,” murmured Andre dejectedly.\\n\\n“But,” continued De Breulh, after a moment’s reflection, “I have a\\ndistant relative, a lady who is also a connection of the Mussidan\\nfamily, the Viscountess de Bois Arden, and she will be glad to be of\\nservice to me. She is young and giddy, but as true as steel. Come with\\nme to her; my carriage is ready.”\\n\\nThe footmen were surprised at seeing their master on such terms of\\nintimacy with the shabbily dressed young man, but ventured, of course,\\non no remarks.\\n\\nNot a word was exchanged during the brief drive to Madame de Bois\\nArden’s house.\\n\\n“Wait for me,” exclaimed De Breulh, springing from the vehicle as soon\\nas it drew up; “I will be back directly.”\\n\\nMadame de Bois Arden is justly called one of the handsomest women in\\nParis. Very fair, with masses of black hair, and a complexion to which\\nart has united itself to the gifts of nature, she is a woman who has\\nbeen everywhere, knows everything, talks incessantly, and generally very\\nwell. She spends forty thousand francs per annum on dress. She is always\\ncommitting all sorts of imprudent acts, and scandal is ever busy with\\nher name. Half a dozen of the opposite sex have been talked of in\\nconnection with her, while in reality she is a true and faithful wife,\\nfor, in spite of all her frivolity, she adores her husband, and is\\nin great awe of him. Such was the character of the lady into whose\\napartment M. de Breulh was introduced. Madame de Bois Arden was engaged\\nin admiring a very pretty fancy costume of the reign of Louis XV., one\\nof Van Klopen’s masterpieces, when M. de Breulh was announced, which she\\nwas going to wear, on her return from the opera, at a masquerade ball at\\nthe Austrian Ambassador’s. Madame de Bois Arden greeted her visitor with\\neffusion, for they had been acquaintances from childhood, and always\\naddressed each other by their Christian names.\\n\\n“What, you here at this hour, Gontran!” said the lady. “Is it a vision,\\nor only a miracle?” But the smile died away upon her lips, as she caught\\na glimpse of her visitor’s pale and harassed face. “Is there anything\\nthe matter?” asked she.\\n\\n“Not yet,” answered he, “but there may be, for I hear that Mademoiselle\\nde Mussidan is dangerously ill.”\\n\\n“Is she really? Poor Sabine! what is the matter with her?”\\n\\n“I do not know; and I want you, Clotilde, to send one of your people to\\ninquire into the truth of what we have heard.”\\n\\nMadame de Bois Arden opened her eyes very wide.\\n\\n“Are you joking?” said she. “Why do you not send yourself?”\\n\\n“It is impossible for me to do so; and if you have any kindness of\\nheart, you do as I ask you; and I want you also to promise me not to say\\na word of this to any one.”\\n\\nExcited as she was by this mystery, Madame de Bois Arden did not ask\\nanother question.\\n\\n“I will do exactly what you want,” replied she, “and respect your\\nsecret. I would go at once, were it not that Bois Arden will never sit\\ndown to dinner without me; but the moment we have finished I will go.”\\n\\n“Thanks, a thousand times; and now I will go home and wait for news from\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Not at all,--you will remain here to dinner.”\\n\\n“I must,--I have a friend waiting for me.”\\n\\n“Do as you please, then,” returned the Viscountess, laughing. “I will\\nsend round a note this evening.”\\n\\nDe Breulh pressed her hand, and hurried down, and was met by Andre at\\nthe door, for he had been unable to sit still in the carriage.\\n\\n“Keep up your courage. Madame de Bois Arden had not heard of\\nMademoiselle Sabine’s illness, and this looks as if it was not a very\\nserious matter. We shall have the real facts in three hours.”\\n\\n“Three hours!” groaned Andre, “what a lapse of time!”\\n\\n“It is rather long, I admit; but we will talk of her while we wait, for\\nyou must stay and dine with me.”\\n\\nAndre yielded, for he had no longer the energy to contest anything. The\\ndinner was exquisite, but the two men were not in a condition of mind\\nto enjoy it, and scarcely consumed anything. Vainly did they endeavor\\nto speak on indifferent subjects, and when the coffee had been served in\\nthe library, they relapsed into utter silence. As the clock struck ten,\\nhowever, a knock was heard at the door, then whisperings, and the rustle\\nof female attire, and lastly Madame de Bois Arden burst upon them like a\\ntornado.\\n\\n“Here I am,” cried she.\\n\\nIt was certainly rather a hazardous step to pay such a late visit to a\\nbachelor’s house, but then the Viscountess de Bois Arden did exactly as\\nshe pleased.\\n\\n“I have come here, Gontran,” exclaimed she, with extreme vehemence, “to\\ntell you that I think your conduct is abominable and ungentlemanly.”\\n\\n“Clotilde!”\\n\\n“Hold your tongue! you are a wretch! Ah! now I can see why you did not\\nwish to write and inquire about poor Sabine. You well knew the effect\\nthat your message would have on her.”\\n\\nM. de Breulh smiled as he turned to Andre and said,--\\n\\n“You see that I was right in what I told you.”\\n\\nThis remark for the first time attracted Madame de Bois Arden’s\\nattention to the fact that a stranger was present, and she trembled lest\\nshe had committed some grave indiscretion.\\n\\n“Gracious heavens!” exclaimed she, with a start, “why, I thought that we\\nwere alone!”\\n\\n“This gentleman has all my confidence,” replied M. de Breulh seriously;\\nand as he spoke he laid his hand upon Andre’s shoulder. “Permit me to\\nintroduce M. Andre to you, my dear Clotilde; he may not be known to-day,\\nbut in a short time his reputation will be European.”\\n\\nAndre bowed, but for once in her life the Viscountess felt embarrassed,\\nfor she was surprised at the extremely shabby attire of this\\nconfidential friend, and then there seemed something wanting to the\\nname.\\n\\n“Then,” resumed De Breulh, “Mademoiselle de Mussidan is really ill, and\\nour information is correct.”\\n\\n“She is.”\\n\\n“Did you see her?”\\n\\n“I did, Gontran; and had you seen her, your heart would have been filled\\nwith pity, and you would have repented your conduct toward her. The\\npoor girl did not even know me. She lay in her bed, whiter than the very\\nsheets, cold and inanimate as a figure of marble. Her large black eyes\\nwere staring wildly, and the only sign of life she exhibited was when\\nthe great tears coursed down her cheeks.”\\n\\nAndre had determined to restrain every token of emotion in the presence\\nof the Viscountess, but her recital was too much for him.\\n\\n“Ah!” said he, “she will die; I know it.”\\n\\nThere was such intense anguish in his tone that even the practised woman\\nof the world was softened.\\n\\n“I assure you, sir,” said she, “that you go too far; there is no present\\ndanger; the doctors say it is catalepsy, which often attacks persons of\\na nervous temperament upon the receipt of a sudden mental shock.”\\n\\n“But what shock has she received?” asked Andre.\\n\\n“No one told me,” answered she after a short pause, “that Sabine’s\\nillness was caused by the breaking off of her engagement; but, of\\ncourse, I supposed that it was.”\\n\\n“That was not the reason, Clotilde; but you have told us nothing; pray,\\ngo on,” interposed De Breulh.\\n\\nThe extreme calmness of her cousin, and a glance which she observed\\npassing between him and Andre, enlightened the Viscountess somewhat.\\n\\n“I asked as much as I dared,” she replied, “but I could only get the\\nvaguest answers. Sabine looked as if she were dead, and her father and\\nmother hovered around her couch like two spectres. Had they slain her\\nwith their own hands, they could not have looked more guilty; their\\nfaces frightened me.”\\n\\n“Tell me precisely what answers were given to your questions,” broke in\\nhe impatiently.\\n\\n“Sabine had seemed so agitated all day, that her mother asked her if she\\nwas suffering any pain.”\\n\\n“We know that already.”\\n\\n“Indeed!” replied the Viscountess, with a look of surprise. “It seems,\\ncousin, that you saw Sabine that afternoon, but what became of her\\nafterward no one appears to know; but there is positive proof that she\\ndid not leave the house, and received no letters. At all events, it was\\nmore than an hour after her maid saw her enter her own room. Sabine said\\na few unintelligible words to the girl, who, seeing the pallor upon her\\nmistress’s face, ran up to her. Just as she did so, Sabine uttered a\\nwild shriek, and fell to the ground. She was raised up and laid upon the\\nbed, but since then she has neither moved nor spoken.”\\n\\n“That is not all,” said De Breulh, who had watched his cousin keenly.\\n\\nThe Viscountess started, and avoided meeting her cousin’s eye.\\n\\n“I do not understand,” she faltered. “Why do you look at me like that?”\\n\\nDe Breulh, who had been pacing up and down the room, suddenly halted in\\nfront of the Viscountess.\\n\\n“My dear Clotilde,” said he, “I am sure when I tell you that the tongue\\nof scandal has often been busy with your name, I am telling you nothing\\nnew.”\\n\\n“Pooh!” answered the Viscountess. “What do I care for that?”\\n\\n“But I always defended you. You are indiscreet--your presence here\\ntonight shows this; but you are, after all, a true woman,--brave and\\ntrue as steel.”\\n\\n“What do you mean by this exordium, Gontran?”\\n\\n“This, Clotilde,--I want to know if I dare venture to intrust to you a\\nsecret which involves the honor of two persons, and, perhaps, the lives\\nof more.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Gontran,” answered she calmly. “You have formed a correct\\njudgment of me.”\\n\\nBut here Andre felt that he must interpose, and, taking a step forward,\\nsaid, “Have you the right to speak?”\\n\\n“My dear Andre,” said De Breulh, “this is a matter in which my honor is\\nas much concerned as yours. Will you not trust me?” Then turning to the\\nViscountess, he added, “Tell us all you heard.”\\n\\n“It is only something I heard from Modeste. You had hardly left the\\nhouse, when the Baron de Clinchain made his appearance.”\\n\\n“An eccentric old fellow, a friend of the Count de Mussidan’s. I know\\nhim.”\\n\\n“Just so; well, they had a stormy interview, and at the end of it, the\\nBaron was taken ill, and it was with difficulty that he regained his\\ncarriage.”\\n\\n“That seems curious.”\\n\\n“Wait a bit. After that Octave and his wife had a terrible scene\\ntogether, and Modeste thinks that her mistress must have heard\\nsomething, for the Count’s voice rang through the house like thunder.”\\n\\nEvery word that the Viscountess uttered strengthened De Breulh’s\\nsuspicions. “There is something mysterious in all this, Clotilde,”\\n said he, “as you will say when you know the whole truth,” and, without\\nomitting a single detail, he related the whole of Sabine and Andre’s\\nlove story.\\n\\nMadame de Bois Arden listened attentively, sometimes thrilled with\\nhorror, and at others pleased with this tale of innocent love.\\n\\n“Forgive me,” said she, when her cousin had concluded; “my reproaches\\nand accusations were equally unfounded.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes; never mind that; but I am afraid that there is some hidden\\nmystery which will place a fresh stumbling-block in our friend Andre’s\\npath.”\\n\\n“Do not say that,” cried Andre, in terror. “What is it?”\\n\\n“That I cannot tell; for Mademoiselle de Mussidan’s sake, I have\\nwithdrawn all my pretensions to her hand,--not to leave the field open\\nto any other intruder, but in order that she may be your wife.”\\n\\n“How are we to learn what has really happened?” asked the Viscountess.\\n\\n“In some way or other we shall find out, if you will be our ally.”\\n\\nMost women are pleased to busy themselves about a marriage, and the\\nViscountess was cheered to find herself mixed up in so romantic a drama.\\n\\n“I am entirely at your beck and call,” answered she. “Have you any\\nplan?”\\n\\n“Not yet, but I will soon. As far as Mademoiselle de Mussidan is\\nconcerned, we must act quite openly. Andre will write to her, asking\\nfor an explanation, and you shall see her to-morrow, and if she is well\\nenough, give her his note.”\\n\\nThe proposal was a startling one, and the Viscountess did not entertain\\nit favorably.\\n\\n“No,” said she, “I think that would not do at all.”\\n\\n“Why not? However, let us leave it to Andre.”\\n\\nAndre, thus addressed, stepped forward, and said,--\\n\\n“I do not think that it would be delicate to let Mademoiselle de\\nMussidan know that her secret is known to any one else than ourselves.”\\n\\nThe Viscountess nodded assent.\\n\\n“If,” continued Andre, “the Viscountess will be good enough to ask\\nModeste to meet me at the corner of the Avenue de Matignon; I shall be\\nthere.”\\n\\n“A capital idea, sir,” said the lady, “and I will give your message to\\nModeste.” She broke off her speech suddenly, and uttered a pretty little\\nshriek, as she noticed that the hands of the clock on the mantelpiece\\npointed to twenty to twelve. “Great heavens!” cried she, “and I am going\\nto a ball at the Austrian Embassy, and now not even dressed.” And, with\\na coquettish gesture, she drew her shawl around her, and ran out of\\nthe room, exclaiming as she descended the stairs, “I will call here\\nto-morrow, Gontran, on my way to the Bois,” and disappeared like\\nlightning.\\n\\nAndre and his host sat over the fire, and conversed for a long time. It\\nseemed strange that two men who had met that morning for the first time\\nshould now be on such intimate terms of friendship; but such was the\\ncase, for a mutual feeling of admiration and respect had sprung up in\\ntheir hearts.\\n\\nM. de Breulh wished to send Andre home in his carriage, but this the\\nyoung man declined, and merely borrowed an overcoat to protect him from\\nthe inclemency of the weather.\\n\\n“To-morrow,” said he, as he made his way home, “Modeste shall tell all\\nshe knows, provided always that that charming society dame does not\\nforget all about our existence before then.”\\n\\nMadame de Bois Arden, however, could sometimes be really in earnest.\\nUpon her return from the ball she would not even go to bed, lest she\\nshould oversleep herself, and the next day Andre found Modeste waiting\\nat the appointed spot, and learnt, to his great grief, that Sabine had\\nnot yet regained consciousness.\\n\\nThe family doctor betrayed no uneasiness, but expressed a wish for a\\nconsultation with another medical man. Meanwhile, the girl promised\\nto meet Andre morning and evening in the same place, and give him such\\nscraps of information as she had been able to pick up. For two whole\\ndays Mademoiselle de Mussidan’s condition remained unchanged, and Andre\\nspent his whole time between his own studio, the Avenue de Matignon, and\\nM. de Breulh’s, where he frequently met Madame de Bois Arden.\\n\\nBut on the third day Modest informed him, with tears in her eyes, that\\nthough the cataleptic fit had passed away, Sabine was struggling with\\na severe attack of fever. Modeste and Andre were so interested in their\\nconversation, that they did not perceive Florestan, who had gone out to\\npost a letter to Mascarin.\\n\\n“Listen, Modeste,” whispered Andre, “you tell me that she is in\\ndanger,--very great danger.”\\n\\n“The doctor said that the crisis would take place to-day; be here at\\nfive this evening.”\\n\\nAndre staggered like a madman to De Breulh’s house; and so excited was\\nhe that his friend insisted upon his taking some repose, and would not,\\nwhen five o’clock arrived, permit Andre to go to the appointment alone.\\nAs they turned the corner, they saw Modeste hurrying toward them.\\n\\n“She is saved, she is saved!” said she, “for she has fallen into a\\ntranquil sleep, and the doctor says that she will recover.”\\n\\nAndre and De Breulh were transported by this news; but they did not know\\nthat they were watched by two men, Mascarin and Florestan, who did not\\nlet one of their movements escape them. Warned by a brief note from\\nFlorestan, Mascarin had driven swiftly to Father Canon’s public-house,\\nwhere he thought he was certain to find the domestic, but the man was\\nnot there, and Mascarin, unable to endure further suspense, sent for him\\nto the Hotel de Mussidan. When the servant informed Mascarin that the\\ncrisis was safely passed, he drew a deep breath of relief; for he no\\nlonger feared that the frail structure that he had built up with such\\npatient care for twenty long years would be shattered at a blow by\\nthe chill hand of death. He bent his brow, however, when he heard of\\nModeste’s daily interviews with the young man whom Florestan termed\\n“Mademoiselle’s lover.”\\n\\n“Ah,” muttered he, “if I could only be present at one of those\\ninterviews!”\\n\\n“And, as you say,” returned Florestan, drawing out, as he spoke, a\\nneat-looking watch, “it is just the hour of their meeting; and as the\\nplace is always the same, you--”\\n\\n“Come, then,” broke in his patron. They went out accordingly, and\\nreached the Champs Elysees by a circuitous route. The place was\\nadmirably suited to their purpose, for close by were several of those\\nlittle wooden huts, occupied in summer by the vendors of cakes and\\nplaythings.\\n\\n“Let us get behind one of these,” said Florestan. Night was drawing\\nin, but objects could still be distinguished, and in about five minutes\\nFlorestan whispered, “Look, there comes Modeste, and there is the lover,\\nbut he has a pal with him to-night. Why, what can she be telling him? He\\nseems quite overcome.”\\n\\nMascarin divined the truth at once, and found that it would be a\\ndifficult task to interfere with the love of a man who displayed so much\\nintensity of feeling.\\n\\n“Then,” remarked Mascarin, savagely, “that great booby, staggering about\\non his friend’s arm, is your young lady’s lover?”\\n\\n“Just so, sir.”\\n\\n“Then we must find out who he is.”\\n\\nFlorestan put on a crafty air, and replied in gentle accents.\\n\\n“The day before yesterday, as I was smoking my pipe outside, I saw this\\nyoung bantam swaggering down the street--not but what he seemed rather\\ncrestfallen; but I knew the reason for that, and should look just as\\nmuch in the dumps if my young woman was laid up. I thought, as I had\\nnothing to do, I might as well see who he was and where he lived; so,\\nsticking my hands in my pockets, after him I sloped. He walked such a\\nlong way, that I got precious sick of my job, but at last I ran him\\nto earth in a house. I went straight up to the lodge, and showed the\\nportress my tobacco pouch, and said, ‘I picked up this; I think that the\\ngentleman who has just gone in dropped it. Do you know him?’ ‘Of course\\nI do,’ said she. ‘He is a painter; lives on the fourth floor; and his\\nname is M. Andre.’”\\n\\n“Was the house in the Rue de la Tour d’Auvergne?” broke in Mascarin.\\n\\n“You are right, sir,” returned the man, taken a little aback. “It seems,\\nsir, that you are better informed than I am.”\\n\\nMascarin did not notice the man’s surprise, but he was struck with the\\nstrange persistency with which this young man seemed to cross his plans,\\nfor he found that the acquaintance of Rose and the lover of Mademoiselle\\nde Mussidan were one and the same person, and he had a presentiment that\\nhe would in some way prove a hindrance to his plans.\\n\\nThe astute Mascarin concentrated all his attention upon Andre.\\n\\nThe latter said something to Modeste, which caused that young woman to\\nraise her hands to heaven, as though in alarm.\\n\\n“But who is the other?” asked he,--“the fellow that looks like an\\nEnglishman?”\\n\\n“Do you not know?” returned the lackey. “Why, that is M. de\\nBreulh-Faverlay.”\\n\\n“What, the man who was to marry Sabine?”\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\nMascarin was not easily disconcerted, but this time a blasphemous oath\\nburst from his lips.\\n\\n“Do you mean,” said he, “that De Breulh and this painter are friends?”\\n\\n“That is more than I can tell. You seem to want to know a lot,” answered\\nFlorestan, sulkily.\\n\\nModeste had now left the young men, who walked arm in arm in the\\ndirection of the Avenue de l’Imperatrice.\\n\\n“M. de Breulh takes his dismissal easily enough,” observed Mascarin.\\n\\n“He was not dismissed; it was he that wrote and broke off the\\nengagement.”\\n\\nThis time Mascarin contrived to conceal the terrible blow that this\\ninformation caused to him, and even made some jesting remark as he took\\nleave of Florestan; but he was in truth completely staggered, for after\\nthoroughly believing that the game was won, he saw that, though perhaps\\nnot lost, his victory was postponed for an indefinite period.\\n\\n“What!” said he, as he clenched his hand firmly, “shall the headstrong\\npassion of this foolish boy mar my plans? Let him take care of himself;\\nfor if he walks in my path, he will find it a road that leads to his own\\ndestruction.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\nAN ACADEMY OF MUSIC.\\n\\nDr. Hortebise had for some time back given up arguing with Mascarin as\\nto the advice the latter gave him. He had been ordered not to let Paul\\nout of his sight, and he obeyed this command literally. He had taken him\\nto dine at M. Martin Rigal’s, though the host himself was absent; from\\nthere he took Paul to his club, and finally wound up by forcing the\\nyoung man to accept a bed at his house. They both slept late, and were\\nsitting down to a luxurious breakfast, when the servant announced M.\\nTantaine, and that worthy man made his appearance with the same smile\\nupon his face which Paul remembered so well in the Hotel de Perou.\\nThe sight of him threw the young man into a state of fury. “At last we\\nmeet,” cried he. “I have an account to settle with you.”\\n\\n“You have an account to settle with me?” asked Daddy Tantaine with a\\npuzzled smile.\\n\\n“Yes; was it not through you that I was accused of theft by that old\\nhag, Madame Loupins?”\\n\\nTantaine shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Dear me,” said he; “I thought that M. Mascarin had explained\\neverything, and that you were anxious to marry Mademoiselle Flavia, and\\nthat, above all, you were a young man of intelligence and tact.”\\n\\nHortebise roared with laughter, and Paul, seeing his folly, blushed\\ndeeply and remained silent.\\n\\n“I regret having disturbed you, doctor,” resumed Tantaine, “but I had\\nstrict orders to see you.”\\n\\n“Is there anything new then?”\\n\\n“Yes; Mademoiselle de Mussidan is out of danger, and M. de Croisenois\\ncan commence proceedings at once.”\\n\\nThe doctor drank off a glass of wine. “To the speedy marriage of our\\ndear friend the Marquis and Mademoiselle Sabine,” said he gayly.\\n\\n“So be it,” said Tantaine; “I am also directed to beg M. Paul not to\\nleave this house, but to send for his luggage and remain here.”\\n\\nHortebise looked so much annoyed that Tantaine hastened to add: “Only as\\na temporary measure, for I am on the lookout for rooms for him now.”\\n\\nPaul looked delighted at the idea of having a home of his own.\\n\\n“Good!” exclaimed the doctor merrily. “And now, my dear Tantaine, as you\\nhave executed all your commissions, you can stay and breakfast with us.”\\n\\n“Thanks for the honor; but I am very busy with affairs of the Duke de\\nChampdoce and must see Perpignan at once.” As he spoke he rose, making\\na little sign which Paul did not catch, and Hortebise accompanied him to\\nthe door of the vestibule. “Don’t leave that lad alone,” said Tantaine;\\n“I will see about him to-morrow; meanwhile prepare him a little.”\\n\\n“I comprehend,” answered Hortebise; “my kind regards to that dear\\nfellow, Perpignan.”\\n\\nThis Perpignan was well known--some people said too well known--in\\nParis. His real name was Isidore Crocheteau, and he had started life\\nas a cook in a Palais Royal restaurant. Unfortunately a breach of the\\nEighth Commandment had caused him to suffer incarceration for a period\\nof three years, and on his release he bloomed out into a private inquiry\\nagent. His chief customers were jealous husbands, but as surely as one\\nof these placed an affair in his hands, he would go to the erring wife\\nand obtain a handsome price from her for his silence.\\n\\nMascarin and Perpignan had met in an affair of this kind; and as they\\nmutually feared each other, they had tacitly agreed not to cross\\neach other’s path in that great wilderness of crime--Paris. But while\\nPerpignan knew nothing of Mascarin’s schemes and operations, the\\nformer was very well acquainted with the ex-cook’s doings. He knew,\\nfor instance, that the income from the Inquiry Office would not cover\\nPerpignan’s expenses, who dressed extravagantly, kept a carriage,\\naffected artistic tastes, played cards, betted on races, and liked good\\ndinners at the most expensive restaurants. “Where can he get his money\\nfrom?” asked Mascarin of himself; and, after a long search, he succeeded\\nin solving the riddle.\\n\\nDaddy Tantaine, after leaving the doctor’s, soon arrived at the\\nresidence of M. Perpignan, and rang the bell.\\n\\nA fat woman answered the door. “M. Perpignan is out,” said she.\\n\\n“When will he be back?”\\n\\n“Some time this evening.”\\n\\n“Can you tell me where I can find him, as it is of the utmost importance\\nto both of us that I should see him at once?”\\n\\n“He did not say where he was going to.”\\n\\n“Perhaps he is at the factory,” said Tantaine blandly.\\n\\nThe fat woman was utterly taken aback by this suggestion. “What do you\\nknow about that?” faltered she.\\n\\n“You see I _do_ know, and that is sufficient for you. Come, is he\\nthere?”\\n\\n“I think so.”\\n\\n“Thank you, I will call on him then. An awfully long journey,” muttered\\nTantaine, as he turned away; “but, perhaps, if I catch the worthy man\\nin the midst of all his little business affairs, he will be more free in\\nhis language, and not so guarded in his actual admissions.”\\n\\nThe old man went to his task with a will. He passed down the Rue\\nToumenon, skirted the Luxemburg, and made his way into the Rue Guy\\nLussac; from thence he walked down the Rue Mouffetard, and thence direct\\ninto one of those crooked lanes which run between the Gobelins Factory\\nand the Hopital de l’Oursine. This is a portion of the city utterly\\nunknown to the greater number of Parisians. The streets are narrow and\\nhardly afford room for vehicles. A valley forms the centre of the place,\\ndown which runs a muddy, sluggish stream, the banks of which are densely\\ncrowded with tanyards and iron works. On the one side of this valley is\\nthe busy Rue Mouffetard, and on the other one of the outer boulevards,\\nwhile a long line of sickly-looking poplars mark the course of the\\nsemi-stagnant stream. Tantaine seemed to know the quarter well, and\\nwent on until he reached the Champs des Alouettes. Then, with a sigh of\\nsatisfaction, he halted before a large, three-storied house, standing on\\na piece of ground surrounded by a mouldering wooden fence. The aspect of\\nthe house had something sinister and gloomy about it, and for a moment\\nTantaine paused as if he could not make up his mind to enter it; but\\nat last he did so. The interior was as dingy and dilapidated as the\\noutside. There were two rooms on the ground floor, one of which was\\nstrewn with straw, with a few filthy-looking quilts and blankets spread\\nover it. The next room was fitted up as a kitchen; in the centre was a\\nlong table composed of boards placed on trestles, and a dirty-looking\\nwoman with her head enveloped in a coarse red handkerchief, and grasping\\na big wooden spoon, was stirring the contents of a large pot in which\\nsome terrible-looking ingredients were cooking. On a small bed in a\\ncorner lay a little boy. Every now and then a shiver convulsed his\\nframe, his face was deadly pale, and his hands almost transparent,\\nwhile his great black eyes glittered with the wild delirium of fever.\\nSometimes he would give a deep groan, and then the old beldame would\\nturn angrily and threaten to strike him with her wooden spoon.\\n\\n“But I am so ill,” pleaded the boy.\\n\\n“If you had brought home what you were told, you would not have been\\nbeaten, and then you would have had no fever,” returned the woman\\nharshly.\\n\\n“Ah, me! I am sick and cold, and want to go away,” wailed the child; “I\\nwant to see mammy.”\\n\\nEven Tantaine felt uneasy at this scene, and gave a gentle cough to\\nannounce his presence. The old woman turned round on him with an angry\\nsnarl. “Who do you want here?” growled she.\\n\\n“Your master.”\\n\\n“He has not yet arrived, and may not come at all, for it is not his day;\\nbut you can see Poluche.”\\n\\n“And who may he be?”\\n\\n“He is the professor,” answered the hag contemptuously.\\n\\n“And where is he?”\\n\\n“In the music-room.”\\n\\nTantaine went to the stairs, which were so dingy and dilapidated as to\\nmake an ascent a work of danger and difficulty. As he ascended higher,\\nhe became aware of a strange sound, something between the grinding\\nof scissors and the snarling of cats. Then a moment’s silence, a loud\\nexecration, and a cry of pain. Tantaine passed on, and coming to a\\nrickety door, he opened it, and in another moment found himself in what\\nthe old hag downstairs had called the music-room. The partitions of\\nall the rooms on the floor had been roughly torn down to form this\\napartment; hardly a pane of glass remained intact in the windows; the\\ndingy, whitewashed walls were covered with scrawls and drawings in\\ncharcoal. A suffocating, nauseous odor rose up, absolutely overpowering\\nthe smell from the neighboring tanyards. There was no furniture except a\\nbroken chair, upon which lay a dog whip with plaited leather lash. Round\\nthe room, against the wall, stood some twenty children, dirty, and in\\ntattered clothes. Some had violins in their hands, and others stood\\nbehind harps as tall as themselves. Upon the violins Tantaine noticed\\nthere were chalk marks at various distances. In the middle of the room\\nwas a man, tall and erect as a dart, with flat, ugly features and lank,\\ngreasy hair hanging down on his shoulders. He, too, had a violin, and\\nwas evidently giving the children a lesson. Tantaine at once guessed\\nthat this was Professor Poluche.\\n\\n“Listen,” said he; “here, you Ascanie, play the chorus from the _Chateau\\nde Marguerite_.” As he spoke he drew his bow across his instrument,\\nwhile the little Savoyard did his best to imitate him, and in a\\nsqueaking voice, in nasal tone, he sang:\\n\\n“Ah! great heavens, how fine and grand Is the palace!”\\n\\n“You young rascal!” cried Poluche. “Have I not bid you fifty times that\\nat the word ‘palace’ you are to place your bow on the fourth chalkmark\\nand draw it across? Begin again.”\\n\\nOnce again the boy commenced, but Poluche stopped him.\\n\\n“I believe, you young villain, that you are doing it on purpose. Now, go\\nthrough the whole chorus again; and if you do not do it right, look out\\nfor squalls.”\\n\\nPoor Ascanie was so muddled that he forgot all his instructions. Without\\nany appearance of anger, the professor took up the whip and administered\\nhalf a dozen severe cuts across the bare legs of the child, whose shouts\\nsoon filled the room.\\n\\n“When you are done howling,” remarked Poluche, “you can try again;\\nand if you do not succeed, no supper for you to-night, my lad. Now,\\nGiuseppe, it is your turn.”\\n\\nGiuseppe, though younger than Ascanie, was a greater proficient on the\\ninstrument, and went through his task without a single mistake.\\n\\n“Good!” said Poluche; “if you get on like that, you will soon be fit to\\ngo out. You would like that, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied the delighted boy, “and I should like to bring in a few\\ncoppers too.”\\n\\nBut the Professor did not waste too much time in idle converse.\\n\\n“It is your turn now, Fabio,” said he.\\n\\nFabio, a little mite of seven, with eyes black and sparkling as those of\\na dormouse, had just seen Tantaine in the doorway and pointed him out to\\nthe professor.\\n\\nPoluche turned quickly round and found himself face to face with\\nTantaine, who had come quickly forward, his hat in his hand.\\n\\nHad the professor seen an apparition, he could not have started more\\nviolently, for he did not like strangers.\\n\\n“What do you want?” asked he.\\n\\n“Reassure yourself, sir,” said Tantaine, after having for a few seconds\\nenjoyed his evident terror; “I am the intimate friend of the gentleman\\nwho employs you, and have come here to discuss an important matter of\\nbusiness with him.”\\n\\nPoluche breathed more freely.\\n\\n“Take a chair, sir,” said he, offering the only one in the room. “My\\nmaster will soon be here.”\\n\\nBut Daddy Tantaine refused the offer, saying that he did not wish to\\nintrude, but would wait until the lesson was over.\\n\\n“I have nearly finished,” remarked Poluche; “it is almost time to let\\nthese scamps have their soup.”\\n\\nThen turning to his pupils, who had not dared to stir a limb, he said,--\\n\\n“There, that is enough for to-day; you can go.”\\n\\nThe children did not hesitate for a moment, but tumbled over each other\\nin their eagerness to get away, hoping, perhaps, that he might omit to\\nexecute certain threats that he had held out during the lesson. The hope\\nwas a vain one, for the equitable Poluche went to the head of the stairs\\nand called out in a loud voice,--\\n\\n“Mother Butor, you will give no soup to Monte and put Ravillet on half\\nallowance.”\\n\\nTantaine was much interested, for the scene was an entirely new one.\\n\\nThe professor raised his eyes to heaven.\\n\\n“Would,” said he, “that I might teach them the divine science as I would\\nwish; but the master would not allow me; indeed, he would dismiss me if\\nI attempted to do so.”\\n\\n“I do not understand you.”\\n\\n“Let me explain to you. You know that there are certain old women who,\\nfor a consideration, will train a linnet or a bullfinch to whistle any\\nair?”\\n\\nTantaine, with all humility, confessed his ignorance of these matters.\\n\\n“Well,” said the professor, “the only difference between those old women\\nand myself is, that they teach birds and I boys; and I know which I had\\nrather do.”\\n\\nTantaine pointed to the whip.\\n\\n“And how about this?” asked he.\\n\\nPoluche shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Put yourself in my place for a little while,” remarked he. “You see my\\nmaster brings me all sorts of boys, and I have to cram music into them\\nin the briefest period possible. Of course the child revolts, and I\\nthrash him; but do not think he cares for this; the young imps thrive on\\nblows. The only way that I can touch them is through their stomachs. I\\nstop a quarter, a half, and sometimes the whole of their dinner. That\\nfetches them, and you have no idea how a little starvation brings them\\non in music.”\\n\\nDaddy Tantaine felt a cold shiver creep over him as he listened to this\\nfrank exposition of the professor’s mode of action.\\n\\n“You can now understand,” remarked the professor, “how some airs become\\npopular in Paris. I have forty pupils all trying the same thing. I am\\ndrilling them now in the _Marguerite_, and in a little time you will\\nhave nothing else in the streets.”\\n\\nPoluche was proceeding to give Tantaine some further information, when a\\nstep was heard upon the stairs, and the professor remarked,--\\n\\n“Here is the master; he never comes up here, because he is afraid of the\\nstairs. You had better go down to him.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\n\\nDIAMOND CUT DIAMOND.\\n\\nThe ex-cook appeared before Tantaine in all his appalling vulgarity as\\nthe latter descended the stairs. The proprietor of the musical academy\\nwas a stout, red-faced man, with an insolent mouth and a cynical eye.\\nHe was gorgeously dressed, and wore a profusion of jewelry. He was\\nmuch startled at seeing Tantaine, whom he knew to be the redoubtable\\nMascarin’s right-hand man. “A thousand thunders!” muttered he. “If these\\npeople have sent him here for me, I must take care what I am about,” and\\nwith a friendly smile he extended his hand to Tantaine.\\n\\n“Glad to see you,” said he. “Now, what can I do for you, for I hope you\\nhave come to ask me to do something?”\\n\\n“The veriest trifle,” returned Tantaine.\\n\\n“I am sorry that it is not something of importance, for I have the\\ngreatest respect for M. Mascarin.”\\n\\nThis conversation had taken place in the window, and was interrupted\\nevery moment by the shouts and laughter of the children; but beneath\\nthese sounds of merriment came an occasional bitter wail of lamentation.\\n\\n“What is that?” inquired Perpignan, in a voice of thunder. “Who presumes\\nto be unhappy in this establishment?”\\n\\n“It is two of the lads that I have put on half rations,” returned\\nPoluche. “I’ll make them learn somehow or----”\\n\\nA dark frown on the master’s face arrested his further speech. “What do\\nI hear?” roared Perpignan. “Do you dare, under my roof, to deprive those\\npoor children of an ounce of food? It is scandalous, I may say, infamous\\non your part, M. Poluche.”\\n\\n“But, sir,” faltered the professor, “have you not told me hundreds of\\ntimes--”\\n\\n“That you were an idiot, and would never be anything better. Go and tell\\nMother Butor to give these poor children their dinner.”\\n\\nRepressing further manifestations of rage, Perpignan took Tantaine by\\nthe arm and led him into a little side-room, which he dignified by the\\nname of his office. There was nothing in it but three chairs, a common\\ndeal table, and a few shelves containing ledgers. “You have come on\\nbusiness, I presume,” remarked Perpignan.\\n\\nTantaine nodded, and the two men seated themselves at the table, gazing\\nkeenly into each other’s eyes, as though to read the thoughts that moved\\nin the busy brain.\\n\\n“How did you find out my little establishment down here?” asked\\nPerpignan.\\n\\n“By a mere chance,” remarked Tantaine carelessly. “I go about a\\ngood deal, and hear many things. For instance, you have taken every\\nprecaution here, and though you are really the proprietor, yet the\\nhusband of your cook and housekeeper, Butor, is supposed to be the owner\\nof the house--at least it stands in his name. Now, if anything untoward\\nhappened, you would vanish, and only Butor would remain a prey for the\\npolice.”\\n\\nTantaine paused for a moment, and then slowly added, “Such tactics\\nusually succeed unless a man has some secret enemy, who would\\ntake advantage of his knowledge, to do him an injury by obtaining\\nirrefragable proofs of his complicity.”\\n\\nThe ex-cook easily perceived the threat that was hidden under these\\nwords. “They know something,” muttered he, “and I must find out what it\\nis.”\\n\\n“If a man has a clear conscience,” said he aloud, “he is all right. I\\nhave nothing to conceal, and therefore nothing to fear. You have now\\nseen my establishment; what do you think of it?”\\n\\n“It seems to me a very well-conducted one.”\\n\\n“It may have occurred to you that a factory at Roubaix might have been a\\nbetter investment, but I had not the capital to begin with.”\\n\\nTantaine nodded. “It is not half a bad trade,” said he.\\n\\n“I agree with you. In the Rue St. Marguerite you will find more than\\none similar establishment; but I never cared for the situation of the\\nFaubourg St. Antoine. My little angels find this spot more salubrious.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” answered Tantaine amicably, “and if they howl too much when\\nthey are corrected, there are not too many neighbors to hear them.”\\n\\nPerpignan thought it best to take no notice of this observation. “The\\npapers are always pitching into us,” continued he. “They had much better\\nstick to politics. The fact is, that the profits of our business are\\ntremendously exaggerated.”\\n\\n“Well, you manage to make a living out of it?”\\n\\n“I don’t lose, I confess, but I have six little cherubs in hospital,\\nbesides the one in the kitchen, and these, of course, are a dead loss to\\nme.”\\n\\n“That is a sad thing for you,” answered Tantaine gravely.\\n\\nPerpignan began to be amazed at his visitor’s coolness.\\n\\n“Damn it all,” said he, “if you and Mascarin think the business such\\na profitable one, why don’t you go in for it. You may perhaps think it\\neasy to procure the kids; just try it. You have to go to Italy for most\\nof them, then you have to smuggle them across the frontier like bales of\\ncontraband goods.”\\n\\nPerpignan paused to take a breath, and Tantaine asked,--\\n\\n“What sum do you make each of the lads bring in daily?”\\n\\n“That depends,” answered Perpignan hesitatingly.\\n\\n“Well, you can give an average?”\\n\\n“Say three francs then.”\\n\\n“Three francs!” repeated Tantaine with a genial smile, “and you have\\nforty little cherubs, so that makes one hundred and twenty francs per\\nday.”\\n\\n“Absurd!” retorted Perpignan; “do you think each of the lads bring in\\nsuch a sum as that?”\\n\\n“Ah! you know the way to make them do so.”\\n\\n“I don’t understand you,” answered Perpignan, in whose voice a shade of\\nanxiety now began to appear.\\n\\n“No offence, no offence,” answered Tantaine; “but the fact is, the\\nnewspapers are doing you a great deal of harm, by retailing some of the\\nmeans adopted by your colleague to make the boys do a good day’s work.\\nDo you recollect the sentence on that master who tied one of his lads\\ndown on a bed, and left him without food for two days at a stretch?”\\n\\n“I don’t care about such matters; no one can bring a charge of cruelty\\nagainst me,” retorted Perpignan angrily.\\n\\n“A man with the kindest heart in the world may be the victim of\\ncircumstances.”\\n\\nPerpignan felt that the decisive moment was at hand.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” asked he.\\n\\n“Well, suppose, to punish one of your refractory lads, you were to shut\\nhim in the cellar. A storm comes on during the night, the gutter gets\\nchoked up, the cellar fills with water, and next morning you find the\\nlittle cherub drowned like a rat in his hole?”\\n\\nPerpignan’s face was livid.\\n\\n“Well, and what then?” asked he.\\n\\n“Ah! now the awkward part of the matter comes. You would not care to\\nsend for the police, that might excite suspicion; the easiest thing is\\nto dig a hole and shove the body into it.”\\n\\nPerpignan got up and placed his back against the door.\\n\\n“You know too much, M. Tantaine,--a great deal too much,” said he.\\n\\nPerpignan’s manner was most threatening; but Tantaine still smiled\\npleasantly, like a child who had just committed some simply mischievous\\nact, the results of which it cannot foresee.\\n\\n“The sentence isn’t heavy,” he continued; “five years’ penal servitude,\\nif evidence of previous good conduct could be put in; but if former\\nantecedents were disclosed, such as a journey to Nancy----”\\n\\nThis was the last straw, and Perpignan broke out,--\\n\\n“What do you mean?” said he; “and what do you want me to do?”\\n\\n“Only a trifling service, as I told you before. My dear sir, do not put\\nyourself in a rage,” he added, as Perpignan seemed disposed to speak\\nagain. “Was it not you who first began to talk of your, ‘em--well, let\\nus say business?”\\n\\n“Then you wanted to make yourself agreeable by talking all this rot to\\nme. Well, shall I tell you in my turn what I think?”\\n\\n“By all means, if it will not be giving you too much trouble.”\\n\\n“Then I tell you that you have come here on an errand which no man\\nshould venture to do alone. You are not of the age and build for\\nbusiness like this. It is a misfortune--a fatal one perhaps--to put\\nyourself in my power, in such a house as this.”\\n\\n“But, my dear sir, what is likely to happen to me?”\\n\\nThe features of the ex-cook were convulsed with fury; he was in that mad\\nstate of rage in which a man has no control over himself. Mechanically\\nhis hand slipped into his pocket; but before he could draw it out again,\\nTantaine who had not lost one of his movements, sprang upon him and\\ngrasped him so tightly by the throat that he was powerless to adopt any\\noffensive measures, in spite of his great strength and robust build.\\nThe struggle was not a long one; the old man hurled his adversary to the\\nground, and placed his foot on his chest, and held him down, his whole\\nface and figure seemingly transfigured with the glories of strength and\\nsuccess.\\n\\n“And so you wished to stab me,--to murder a poor and inoffensive old\\nman. Do you think that I was fool enough to enter your cut-throat door\\nwithout taking proper precautions?” And as he spoke he drew a revolver\\nfrom his bosom. “Throw away your knife,” added he sternly.\\n\\nIn obedience to this mandate, Perpignan, who was now entirely\\ndemoralized, threw the sharp-pointed weapon which he had contrived to\\nopen in his pocket into a corner of the room.\\n\\n“Good,” said Tantaine. “You are growing more reasonable now. Of course I\\ncame alone, but do you think that plenty of people did not know where I\\nwas going to? Had I not returned to-night, do you think that my master,\\nM. Mascarin, would have been satisfied? and how long do you think it\\nwould have been before he and the police would have been here. If you do\\nnot do all that I wish for the rest of your life, you will be the most\\nungrateful fellow in the world.”\\n\\nPerpignan was deeply mortified; he had been worsted in single combat,\\nand now he was being found out, and these things had never happened to\\nhim before.\\n\\n“Well, I suppose that I must give in,” answered he sulkily.\\n\\n“Quite so; it is a pity that you did not think of that before.”\\n\\n“You vexed me and made me angry.”\\n\\n“Just so; well, now, get up, take that chair, and let us talk\\nreasonably.”\\n\\nPerpignan obeyed without a word.\\n\\n“Now,” said Tantaine, “I came here with a really magnificent proposal.\\nBut I adopted the course I pursued because I wished to prove to you\\nthat _you_ belonged more absolutely to Mascarin than did your wretched\\nforeign slaves to you. You are absolutely at his mercy, and he can crush\\nyou to powder whenever he likes.”\\n\\n“Your Mascarin is Satan himself,” muttered the discomfited man. “Who can\\nresist him?”\\n\\n“Come, as you think thus, we can talk sensibly at last.”\\n\\n“Well,” answered Perpignan ruefully, as he adjusted his disordered\\nnecktie, “say what you like, I have no answer to make.”\\n\\n“Let us begin at the commencement,” said Tantaine. “For some days past\\nyour people have been following a certain Caroline Schimmel. A fellow of\\nsixteen called Ambrose, a lad with a harp, was told off for this duty.\\nHe is not to be trusted. Only a night or two ago one of my men made him\\ndrunk; and fearing lest his absence might create surprise, drove him\\nhere in a cab, and left him at the corner.”\\n\\nThe ex-cook uttered an oath.\\n\\n“Then you too are watching Caroline,” said he. “I knew well that there\\nwas some one else in the field, but that was no matter of mine.”\\n\\n“Well, tell me why you are watching her?”\\n\\n“How can you ask me? You know that my motto is silence and discretion,\\nand that this is a secret intrusted to my honor.”\\n\\nTantaine shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Why do you talk like that, when you know very well that you are\\nfollowing Ambrose on your own account, hoping by that means to penetrate\\na secret, only a small portion of which has been intrusted to you?”\\n remarked he.\\n\\n“Are you certain of this statement?” asked the man, with a cunning look.\\n\\n“So sure that I can tell you that the matter was placed in your hands by\\na certain M. Catenac.”\\n\\nThe expression in Perpignan’s face changed from astonishment to fear.\\n\\n“Why, this Mascarin knows everything,” muttered he.\\n\\n“No,” replied Tantaine, “my master does not know everything, and the\\nproof of this is, that I have come to ask you what occurred between\\nCatenac’s client and yourself, and this is the service that we expect\\nfrom you.”\\n\\n“Well, if I must, I must. About three weeks ago, one morning, I had just\\nfinished with half a dozen clients at my office in the Rue de Fame, when\\nmy servant brought me Catenac’s card. After some talk, he asked me if I\\ncould find out a person that he had utterly lost sight of. Of course I\\nsaid, yes, I could. Upon this he asked me to make an appointment for ten\\nthe next morning, when some one would call on me regarding the affair.\\nAt the appointed time a shabbily dressed man was shown in. I looked at\\nhim up and down, and saw that, in spite of his greasy hat and threadbare\\ncoat, his linen was of the finest kind, and that his shoes were the work\\nof one of our best bootmakers. ‘Aha,’ said I to myself, ‘you thought to\\ntake me in, did you!’ I handed him a chair, and he at once proceeded\\nto let me into his reasons for coming. ‘Sir,’ said he, ‘my life has not\\nbeen a very happy one, and once I was compelled to take to the Foundling\\nAsylum a child that I loved very dearly, the son of a woman whom I\\nadored. She is dead now, and I am old and solitary. I have a small\\nproperty, and would give half of it to recover the child. Tell me,\\nis there any chance of my doing so?’ You must imagine, my dear sir,”\\n continued he, after a slight pause, “that I was much interested in this\\nstory, for I said to myself, that the man’s fortune must be a very small\\none if half of it would not amply repay me for making a journey to the\\nFoundling Hospital. So I agreed to undertake the business, but the old\\nfellow was too sharp for me. ‘Stop a bit, and let me finish,’ said he,\\n‘and you will see that your task will not be so easy as you seem to\\nthink it.’ I, of course, bragged of my enormous sources of information,\\nand the probability of ultimate success.”\\n\\n“Keep to your story,” said Tantaine impatiently, “I know all about\\nthat.”\\n\\n“I will leave you, then, to imagine all I said to the old man, who\\nlistened to me with great satisfaction. ‘I only hope that you are as\\nskilful as M. Catenac says you are, and have as much influence and power\\nas you assert, for no man has a finer chance than you now have. I have\\ntried all means up to this, but I have failed.’ I went first to the\\nhospital where the child had been placed, and they showed me the\\nregister containing the date of his admission, but no one knew what had\\nbecome of him, for at twelve years of age he had left the place, and no\\none had heard of him since; and in spite of every effort, I have been\\nunable to discover whether he is alive or dead.”\\n\\n“A pretty riddle to guess,” remarked Tantaine.\\n\\n“An enigma that it is impossible to solve,” returned Perpignan. “How is\\none to get hold of a boy who vanished ten years ago, and who must now be\\na grown-up man?”\\n\\n“We could do it.”\\n\\nTantaine’s tone was so decided, that the other man looked sharply at\\nhim with a vague suspicion rising in his breast that the affair had also\\nbeen placed in Mascarin’s hands; and if so, whether he had worked it\\nwith more success than himself.\\n\\n“You might, for all I know; but I felt that the clue was absolutely\\nwanting,” answered Perpignan sulkily. “I put on a bold face, however,\\nand asked for the boy’s description. The man told me that he could\\nprovide me with an accurate one, for that many people, notably the lady\\nsuperior, remembered the lad. He could also give other details which\\nmight be useful.”\\n\\n“And these you obtained, of course?”\\n\\n“Not yet.”\\n\\n“Are you joking?”\\n\\n“Not a bit. I do not know whether the old man was sharp enough to read\\nin the expression of my features that I had not the smallest hope of\\nsuccess; be that as it may, he could give me no further information that\\nday, declaring that he came in only to consult me, and that everything\\nmust be done in a most confidential way. I hastened to assure him that\\nmy office was a perfect tomb of secrets. He told me that he took that\\nfor granted. Then telling me that he wished me to draw up a _precis_ of\\nmy intended course, he took out a note for five hundred francs, which\\nhe handed to me for my time. I refused to take it, though it cost me\\na struggle to do so, for I thought that I should make more out of him\\nlater on. But he insisted on my taking it, saying that he would see me\\nagain soon, and that Catenac would communicate with me. He left me less\\ninterested in the search than in who this old man could possibly be.”\\n\\nTantaine felt that Perpignan was telling the truth.\\n\\n“Did you not try and find out that?” asked he.\\n\\nPerpignan hesitated; but feeling convinced that there was no loophole\\nfor escape, he answered, “Hardly had my visitor left than, slipping on\\na cap and a workman’s blouse, I followed him in his track, and saw him\\nenter one of the finest houses in the Rue de Varennes.”\\n\\n“He lived there then?”\\n\\n“He did, and he was a very well-known man--the Duke de Champdoce.”\\n\\n“Yes, I know all that,” answered Tantaine, placidly, “but I can’t, for\\nthe life of me, imagine the connection between the Duke and Caroline\\nSchimmel.”\\n\\nPerpignan raised his eyebrows.\\n\\n“Why did you put a man to watch her?” asked Tantaine.\\n\\n“My reasons for doing so were most simple. I made every inquiry\\nregarding the Duke; learned that he was very wealthy, and lived a very\\nsteady life. He is married, and loves his wife dearly. They had one son,\\nwhom they lost a year ago, and have never recovered from the shock. I\\nimagine that this Duke, having lost his legitimate heir, wished me to\\nfind his other son. Do you not think that I am right?”\\n\\n“There is something in it; but, after all, you have not explained your\\nreasons for watching Caroline.”\\n\\nPerpignan was no match for Mascarin’s right-hand man, but he was keen\\nenough to discern that Tantaine was putting a string of questions to him\\nwhich had been prepared in advance. This he, however, was powerless to\\nresent.\\n\\n“As you may believe,” said he, “I made every inquiry into the past as\\nwell as the present of the Duke, and also tried to discover who was the\\nmother of the child, but in this I entirely failed.”\\n\\n“What! not with all your means?” cried Tantaine, with a sneer.\\n\\n“Laugh at me as much as you like; but out of the thirty servants in the\\nChampdoce establishment, not one has been there more than ten years.\\nNor could I anywhere lay my hands upon one who had been in the Duke’s\\nservice in his youth. Once, however, as I was in the wineshop in the Rue\\nde Varennes, I quite by chance heard allusion made to a woman who had\\nbeen in the service of the Duke twenty-five years ago, and who was\\nnow in receipt of a small allowance from him. This woman was Caroline\\nSchimmel. I easily found out her address, and set a watch on her.”\\n\\n“And of what use will she be to you?”\\n\\n“Very little, I fear. And yet the allowance looks as if she had at one\\ntime done something out of the way for her employers. Can it be that she\\nhas any knowledge of the birth of this natural child?”\\n\\n“I don’t think much of your idea,” returned Tantaine carelessly.\\n\\n“Since then,” continued Perpignan, “the Duke has never put in an\\nappearance in my office.”\\n\\n“But how about Catenac?”\\n\\n“I have seen him three times.”\\n\\n“Has he told you nothing more? Do you not even know in which hospital\\nthe child was placed?”\\n\\n“No; and on my last visit I plainly told him that I was getting sick of\\nall this mystery; and he said that he himself was tired, and was sorry\\nthat he had ever meddled in the affair.”\\n\\nTantaine was not surprised at hearing this, and accounted for Catenac’s\\nchange of front by the threats of Mascarin.\\n\\n“Well, what do you draw from this?” asked he.\\n\\n“That Catenac has no more information than I have. The Duke most likely\\nproposes to drop the affair; but, were I in his place, I should be\\nafraid to find the boy, however much I might at one time have desired\\nto do so. He may be in prison--the most likely thing for a lad who, at\\ntwelve years of age, ran away from a place where he was well treated. I\\nhave, however, planned a mode of operation, for, with patience, money,\\nand skill, much might be done.”\\n\\n“I agree with you.”\\n\\n“Then let me tell you. I have drawn an imaginary circle round Paris. I\\nsaid to myself, ‘I will visit every house and inn in the villages round\\nwithin this radius; I will enter every isolated dwelling, and will say\\nto the inhabitants, “Do any of you remember at any time sheltering and\\nfeeding a child, dressed in such and such a manner?”’ giving at the\\nsame time a description of him. I am sure that I should find some one\\nwho would answer in the affirmative. Then I should gain a clue which I\\nwould follow up to the end.”\\n\\nThis plan appeared so ingenious to Tantaine, that he involuntarily\\nexclaimed,--\\n\\n“Good! excellent!”\\n\\nPerpignan hardly knew whether Tantaine was praising or blaming him. His\\nmanner might have meant either.\\n\\n“You are very fast,” returned he dismally. “Perhaps presently you will\\nbe good enough to allow that I am not an absolute fool. Do you really\\nthink that I am an idiot? At any rate, I sometimes hit upon a judicious\\ncombination. For example, with regard to this boy, I have a notion\\nwhich, if properly worked might lead to something.”\\n\\n“Might I ask what it is?”\\n\\n“I speak confidentially. If it is impossible to lay our hands upon the\\nreal boy, why should we not substitute another?”\\n\\nAt this suggestion, Tantaine started violently.\\n\\n“It would be most dangerous, most hazardous,” gasped he.\\n\\n“You are afraid, then?” said Perpignan, delighted at the effect his\\nproposal had made.\\n\\n“It seems it is you who were afraid,” retorted Tantaine.\\n\\n“You do not know me when you say that,” said Perpignan.\\n\\n“If you were not afraid,” asked Tantaine, in his most oily voice, “why\\ndid you not carry out your plan?”\\n\\n“Because there was one obstacle that could not be got over.”\\n\\n“Well, I can’t see it myself,” returned Tantaine, desirous of hearing\\nevery detail.\\n\\n“Ah, there is one thing that I omitted in my narrative. The Duke\\ninformed me that he could prove the identity of the boy by certain\\nscars.”\\n\\n“Scars? And of what kind, pray?”\\n\\n“Now you are asking me too much. I do not know.”\\n\\nOn receiving this reply, Tantaine rose hastily from his chair, and thus\\nconcealed his agitation from his companion.\\n\\n“I have a hundred apologies to make for taking up so much of your\\nvaluable time. My master has got it into his head that you were after\\nthe same game as ourselves. He was mistaken, and now we leave the field\\nclear to you.”\\n\\nBefore Perpignan could make any reply, the old man had passed through\\nthe doorway. On the threshold he paused, and said,--\\n\\n“Were I in your place, I would stick to my first plan. You will never\\nfind the boy, but you will get several thousand francs out of the Duke,\\nwhich I am sure will come in handy.”\\n\\n“There are scars now, then,” muttered Tantaine, as he moved away from\\nthe house, “and that Master Catenac never said a word about them!”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\n\\nFATHER AND SON.\\n\\nTwo hours after Andre had left the Avenue de Matignon, one of Mascarin’s\\nmost trusty emissaries was at his heels, who could watch his actions\\nwith the tenacity of a bloodhound. Andre, however, now that he had heard\\nof Sabine’s convalescence, had entirely recovered the elasticity of his\\nspirits, and would never have noticed that he was being followed. His\\nheart, too, was much rejoiced at the friendship of M. de Breulh and the\\npromise of assistance from the Viscountess de Bois Arden; and with the\\nassistance of these two, he felt that he could end his difficulties.\\n\\n“I must get to work again,” muttered he, as he left M. de Breulh’s\\nhospitable house. “I have already lost too much time. To-morrow, if you\\nlook up at the scaffolding of a splendid house in the Champs Elysees,\\nyou will see me at work.”\\n\\nAndre was busy all night with his plans for the rich contractor, M.\\nGandelu, who wanted as much ornamental work on the outside of his house\\nas he had florid decorations within. He rose with the lark, and having\\ngazed for a moment on Sabine’s portrait, started for the abode of M.\\nGandelu, the proud father of young Gaston. This celebrated contractor\\nlived in a splendid house in the Rue Chasse d’Antin, until his more\\npalatial residence should be completed.\\n\\nWhen Andre presented himself at the door, an old servant, who knew him\\nwell, strongly urged him not to go up.\\n\\n“Never,” said he, “in all the time that I have been with master, have I\\nseen him in such a towering rage. Only just listen!”\\n\\nIt was easy to hear the noise alluded to, mingled with the breaking of\\nglass and the smashing of furniture.\\n\\n“The master has been at this game for over an hour,” remarked the\\nservant, “ever since his lawyer, M. Catenac, has left him.”\\n\\nAndre, however, decided not to postpone his visit. “I must see him in\\nspite of everything; show me up,” said he.\\n\\nWith evident reluctance the domestic obeyed, and threw open the door of\\na room superbly furnished and decorated, in the centre of which stood M.\\nGandelu waving the leg of a chair frantically in his hand. He was a man\\nof sixty years of age, but did not look fifty, built like a Hercules,\\nwith huge hands and muscular limbs which seemed to fret under the\\nrestraint of his fashionable garments. He had made his enormous fortune,\\nof which he was considerably proud, by honest labor, and no one could\\nsay that he had not acted fairly throughout his whole career. He was\\ncoarse and violent in his manner, but he had a generous heart and never\\nrefused aid to the deserving and needy. He swore like a trooper, and his\\ngrammar was faulty; but for all that, his heart was in the right place,\\nand he was a better man than many who boast of high birth and expensive\\neducation.\\n\\n“What idiot is coming here to annoy me?” roared he, as soon as the door\\nwas opened.\\n\\n“I have come by appointment,” answered Andre, and the contractor’s brow\\ncleared as he saw who his visitor was.\\n\\n“Ah, it is you, is it? Take a seat; that is, if there is a sound chair\\nleft in the room. I like you, for you have an honest face and don’t\\nshirk hard work. You needn’t color up, though; modesty is no fault. Yes,\\nthere is something in you, and when you want a hundred thousand\\nfrancs to go into business with, here it is ready for you; and had I a\\ndaughter, you should marry her, and I would build your house for you.”\\n\\n“I thank you much,” said Andre; “but I have learned to depend entirely\\non myself.”\\n\\n“True,” returned Gandelu, “you never knew your parents; you never knew\\nwhat a kind father would do for his child. Do you know my son?” asked\\nhe, suddenly turning upon Andre.\\n\\nThis question at once gave Andre the solution of the scene before him.\\nM. Gandelu was irritated at some folly that his son had committed. For\\na moment Andre hesitated; he did not care to say anything that might\\nrevive the old man’s feeling of anger, and therefore merely replied that\\nhe had only met his son Gaston two or three times.\\n\\n“Gaston,” cried the old man, with a bitter oath; “do not call him that.\\nDo you think it likely that old Nicholas Gandelu would ever have been\\nass enough to call his son Gaston? He was called Peter, after his\\ngrandfather, but it wasn’t a good enough one for the young fool; he\\nwanted a swell name, and Peter had too much the savor of hard work in\\nit for my fine gentleman. But that isn’t all; I could let that pass,”\\n continued the old man. “Pray have you seen his cards? Over the name of\\nGaston de Gandelu is a count’s coronet. He a count indeed! the son of a\\nman who has carried a hod for years!”\\n\\n“Young people will be young people,” Andre ventured to observe; but the\\nold man’s wrath would not be assuaged by a platitude like this.\\n\\n“You can find no excuse for him, only the fellow is absolutely ashamed\\nof his father. He consorts with titled fools and is in the seventh\\nheaven if a waiter addresses him as ‘Count,’ not seeing that it is not\\nhe that is treated with respect, but the gold pieces of his old father,\\nthe working man.”\\n\\nAndre’s position was now a most painful one, and he would have given a\\ngood deal not to be the recipient of a confidence which was the result\\nof anger.\\n\\n“He is only twenty, and yet see what a wreck he is,” resumed Gandelu.\\n“His eyes are dim, and he is getting bald; he stoops, and spends his\\nnights in drink and bad company. I have, however, only myself to blame,\\nfor I have been far too lenient; and if he had asked me for my head, I\\nbelieve that I should have given it to him. He had only to ask and have.\\nAfter my wife’s death, I had only the boy. Do you know what he has in\\nthis house? Why, rooms fit for a prince, two servants and four horses. I\\nallow him monthly, fifteen hundred francs, and he goes about calling\\nme a niggard, and has already squandered every bit of his poor mother’s\\nfortune.” He stopped, and turned pale, for at that moment the door\\nopened, and young Gaston, or rather Peter, slouched into the room.\\n\\n“It is the common fate of fathers to be disappointed in their offspring,\\nand to see the sons who ought to have been their honor and glory the\\nscourge to punish their worldly aspirations,” exclaimed the old man.\\n\\n“Good! that is really a very telling speech,” murmured Gaston\\napprovingly, “considering that you have not made a special study of\\nelocution.”\\n\\nFortunately his father did not catch these words, and continued in a\\nvoice broken by emotion, “That, M. Andre, is my son, who for twenty\\nyears has been my sole care. Well, believe it or not, as you like, he\\nhas been speculating on my death, as you might speculate on a race-horse\\nat Vincennes.”\\n\\n“No, no,” put in Gaston, but his father stopped him with a disdainful\\ngesture.\\n\\n“Have at least the courage to acknowledge your fault. You thought me\\nblind because I said nothing, but your past conduct has opened my eyes.”\\n\\n“But, father!”\\n\\n“Do not attempt to deny it. This very morning my man of business, M.\\nCatenac, wrote to me, and with that real courage which only true\\nfriends possess, told me all. I must tell you, M. Andre,” resumed the\\ncontractor, “I was ill. I had a severe attack of the gout, such as a man\\nseldom recovers from, and my son was constant in his attendance at my\\nsick couch. This consoled me. ‘He loves me after all,’ said I. But it\\nwas only my testamentary arrangements that he wanted to discover, and\\nhe went straight to a money-lender called Clergot and raised a hundred\\nthousand francs assuring the blood-sucker that I had not many hours to\\nlive.”\\n\\n“It is a lie!” cried Gaston, his face crimsoning with shame.\\n\\nThe old man raised the leg of the chair in his hand, and made so\\nthreatening a movement that Andre flung himself between father and son.\\n“Great heavens!” cried he, “think what you are doing, sir, and forbear.”\\n\\nThe old man paused, passed his hand round his brow, and flung the weapon\\ninto a remote corner of the room. “I thank you,” said he, grasping\\nAndre’s hand; “you have saved me from a great crime. In another moment I\\nshould have murdered him.”\\n\\nGaston was no coward, and he still retained the position he had been in\\nbefore.\\n\\n“This is quite romantic,” muttered he. “The governor seems to be going\\nin for infanticide.”\\n\\nAndre did not allow him to finish the sentence, for, grasping the young\\nman’s wrist, he whispered fiercely, “Not another word; silence!”\\n\\n“But I want to know what it all means?” answered the irrepressible\\nyouth.\\n\\n“I had in my hands,” said the old man, addressing Andre, and ignoring\\nthe presence of his son, “the important paper he had copied. Yes; not\\nmore than an hour ago I read it. These were the terms: if I died within\\neight days from the date of signature, my son agreed to pay a bonus of\\nthirty thousand francs; but if I lived for one month, he would take up\\nthe bill by paying one hundred and fifty thousand. If, however, by any\\nunforeseen chance, I should recover entirely, he bound himself to pay\\nClergot the hundred thousand francs.”\\n\\nThe old man tore the cravat from his swelling throat, and wiped the\\nbeads of cold sweat that bedewed his brow.\\n\\n“When this man recovers his self-command,” thought Andre, “he will never\\nforgive me for having been the involuntary listener to this terrible\\ntale.” But in this Andre was mistaken, for unsophisticated nature\\nrequires sympathy, and Nichols Gandelu would have said the same to the\\nfirst comer.\\n\\n“Before, however, delivering the hundred thousand francs, the usurer\\nwished to make himself more secure, and asked for a certificate from\\nsome one who had seen me. This person was his friend. He spoke to me of\\na medical man, a specialist, who would understand my case at once. Would\\nI not see him? Never had I seen my son so tender and affectionate. I\\nyielded to his entreaties at last, and one evening I said to him, ‘Bring\\nin this wonderful physician, if you really think he can do anything for\\nme,’ and he did bring him.\\n\\n“Yes, M. Andre, he found a medical man base and vile enough to become\\nthe tool of my son, and a money-lender; and if I choose, I can expose\\nhim to the loathing of the world, and the contempt of his brethren.\\n\\n“The fellow came, and his visit lasted nearly an hour. I can see him\\nnow, asking questions and feeling my pulse. He went away at last, and my\\nson followed him. They both met Clergot, who was waiting in the street.\\n‘You can pay him the cash; the old man won’t last twenty-four hours\\nlonger,’ said the doctor; and then my son came back happy and radiant,\\nand assured me that I should soon be well again. And strange as it may\\nseem, a change for the better took place that very night. Clergot had\\nasked for forty-eight hours in which to raise the sum required. He heard\\nof my convalescence, and my son lost the money.\\n\\n“Was it courage you lacked?” asked the old man, turning for the first\\ntime to his son. “Did you not know that ten drops instead of one of the\\nmedicine I was taking would have freed you from me for ever?”\\n\\nGaston did not seem at all overwhelmed. Indeed, he was wondering how the\\nmatter had reached his father’s ears, and how Catenac had discovered the\\nrough draft of the agreement.\\n\\nThe contractor had imagined that his son would implore forgiveness; but\\nseeing that he remained obdurate, his violence burst forth again. “And\\ndo you know what use my son would make of my fortune? He would squander\\nit on a creature he picked up out of the streets,--a woman he called\\nMadame de Chantemille,--a fit companion for a noble count!”\\n\\nThe shaft had penetrated the impassability which Gaston had up to this\\ndisplayed. “You should not insult Zora,” said he.\\n\\n“I shall not,” returned his father with a grim laugh, “take the trouble\\nto do that; you are not of age, and I shall clap your friend Madame de\\nChantemille into prison.”\\n\\n“You would not do that!”\\n\\n“Would I not? You are a minor; but your Zora, whose real name is Rose,\\nis much older; the law is wholly on my side.”\\n\\n“But father--”\\n\\n“There is no use in crying; my lawyer has the matter in hand, and by\\nnightfall your Zora will be securely caged.”\\n\\nThis blow was so cruel and unexpected, that the young man could only\\nrepeat,--\\n\\n“Zora in prison!”\\n\\n“Yes, in the House of Correction, and from thence to Saint Lazare.\\nCatenac told me the very things to be done.”\\n\\n“Shameful!” exclaimed Gaston, “Zora in prison! Why, I and my friends\\nwill lay siege to the place. I will go to the Court, stand by her side,\\nand depose that this all comes from your devilish malignity. I will say\\nthat I love and esteem her, and that as soon as I am of age I will marry\\nher; the papers will write about us. Go on, go on; I rather like the\\nidea.”\\n\\nHowever great a man’s self-control may be, it has its limits. M. Gandelu\\nhad restrained himself even while he told his son of his villainous\\nconduct; but these revolting threats were more than he could endure,\\nand Andre seeing this, stepped forward, opened the door, and thrust the\\nfoolish youth into the corridor.\\n\\n“What have you done” cried the contractor; “do you not see that he will\\ngo and warn that vile creature, and that she will escape from justice?”\\n\\nAnd as Andre, fearing he knew not what, tried to restrain him, the old\\nman, exerting all his muscular strength, thrust him on one side with\\nperfect ease, and rushed from the room, calling loudly to his servants.\\n\\nAndre was horrified at the scene at which, in spite of himself, he had\\nbeen compelled to assist as a witness. He was not a fool, and had lived\\ntoo much in the world of art not to have witnessed many strange scenes\\nand met with many dissolute characters; but, as a rule, the follies of\\nthe world had amused rather than disgusted him. But this display of want\\nof feeling on the part of a son toward a father absolutely chilled his\\nblood. In a few minutes M. Gandelu appeared with a calmer expression\\nupon his face.\\n\\n“I will tell you how matters now stand,” said he, in a voice that\\nquivered in spite of his efforts. “My son is locked up in his room,\\nand a trustworthy servant whom he cannot corrupt has mounted guard over\\nhim.”\\n\\n“Do you not fear, sir, that in his excitement and anger he may----?”\\n\\nThe contractor shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“You do not know him,” answered he, “if you imagine that he resembles\\nme in any way. What do you think that he is doing now? Lying on his bed,\\nface downward, yelling for his Zora. Zora, indeed! As if that was a name\\nfit for a Christian. How is it that these creatures are enabled to drug\\nour boys and lead them anywhere? Had his mother not been a saint on\\nearth, I should scarcely believe that he was my son.”\\n\\nThe contractor sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.\\n\\n“You are in pain, sir?” said Andre.\\n\\n“Yes; my heart is deeply wounded. Up to this time I have only felt as a\\nfather; now I feel as a man. To-morrow I send for my family and consult\\nwith them; and I shall advertise that for the future I will not be\\nresponsible for any debts that my son may contract. He shall not have a\\npenny, and will soon learn how society treats a man with empty pockets.\\nAs to the girl, she will disappear in double quick time. I have\\nthoroughly weighed the consequences of sending this girl to gaol, and\\nthey are very terrible. My son will do as he has threatened, I am sure\\nof that; and I can picture him tied to that infamous creature for life,\\nlooking into her face, and telling her that he adores her, and glorying\\nin his dishonor, which will be repeated by every Parisian newspaper.”\\n\\n“But is there no other way of proceeding?” asked Andre.\\n\\n“No, none whatever. If all modern fathers had my courage, we should not\\nhave so many profligate sons. It is impossible that this conferring with\\nthe doctor and the money-lender could have originated in my son’s weak\\nbrain. He is a mere child, and some one must have put him up to it.”\\n\\nThe poor father was already seeking for some excuse for the son’s\\nconduct.\\n\\n“I must not dwell on this longer,” continued Gandelu, “or I shall get as\\nmad as I was before. I will look at your plans another day. Now, let us\\nget out of the house. Come and look at the new building in the Champs\\nElysees.”\\n\\nThe mansion in question was situated at the corner of the Rue de\\nChantilly, near the Avenue des Champs Elysees, and the frontage of it\\nwas still marked by scaffolding, so that but little of it could be\\nseen. A dozen workmen, engaged by Andre, were lounging about. They had\\nexpected to see him early, and were surprised at his non-appearance,\\nas he was usually punctuality itself. Andre greeted them in a friendly\\nmanner, but M. Gandelu, though he was always on friendly terms with his\\nworkmen, passed by them as if he did not even notice their existence. He\\nwalked through the different rooms and examined them carelessly, without\\nseeming to take any interest in them, for his thoughts were with his\\nson,--his only son.\\n\\nAfter a short time he returned to Andre.\\n\\n“I cannot stay longer,” said he; “I am not feeling well; I will be here\\nto-morrow;” and he went away with his head bent down on his chest.\\n\\nThe workmen noticed his strange and unusual manner.\\n\\n“He does not look very bright,” remarked one to his comrade. “Since\\nhis illness he has not been the same man. I think he must have had some\\nterrible shock.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV.\\n\\nAN ARTFUL TRICK.\\n\\nAndre had removed his coat and donned his blouse, the sleeves of which\\nwere rolled up to his shoulders. “I must get to business,” murmured he,\\n“to make up for lost time.” He set to work with great vigor, but had\\nhardly got into the swing, when a lad came actively up the ladder and\\ntold him that a gentleman wished to see him, “and a real swell, too,”\\n added the boy. Andre was a good deal put out at being disturbed, but\\nwhen he reached the street and saw that it was M. de Breulh-Faverlay\\nwho was waiting for him, his ill-humor disappeared like chaff before the\\nwind.\\n\\n“Ah, this is really kind of you,” cried he; for he could never forget\\nthe debt of gratitude he owed to the gentleman. “A thousand thanks for\\nremembering me. Excuse my not shaking hands, but see;” and he exhibited\\nhis palms all white with plaster. As he did so the smile died away on\\nhis lips, for he caught sight of his friend’s face.\\n\\n“What is the matter?” exclaimed he, anxiously. “Is Sabine worse? Has she\\nhad a relapse?”\\n\\nDe Breulh shook his head, but the expression of his face clearly said,--\\n\\n“Would to heavens it were only that!”\\n\\nBut the news that Sabine was not worse relieved Andre at once, and he\\npatiently waited for his friend to explain.\\n\\n“I have seen her twice for you,” answered De Breulh; “but it is\\nabsolutely necessary that you should come to a prompt decision on an\\nimportant affair.”\\n\\n“I am quite at your service,” returned Andre a good deal surprised and\\ntroubled.\\n\\n“Then come with me at once, I did not drive here, but we shall not be\\nmore than a quarter of an hour in reaching my house.”\\n\\n“I will follow you almost immediately. I only ask five minutes’ grace to\\ngo up to the scaffold again.”\\n\\n“Have you any orders to give?”\\n\\n“No, I have none.”\\n\\n“Why should you go, then?”\\n\\n“To make myself a little more presentable.”\\n\\n“Is it an annoyance or inconvenience for you to go out in that dress?”\\n\\n“Not a bit, I am thoroughly used to it; but it was for your sake.”\\n\\n“If that is all, come along.”\\n\\n“But people will stare at seeing you in company with a common workman.”\\n\\n“Let them stare.” And drawing Andre’s arm through his, M. de Breulh set\\noff.\\n\\nAndre was right; many persons did turn round to look at the fashionably\\ndressed gentleman walking arm in arm with a mason in his working attire,\\nbut De Breulh took but little heed, and to all Andre’s questions simply\\nsaid, “Wait till we reach my house.”\\n\\nAt length they arrived, without having exchanged twenty words, and\\nentering the library closed the door. M. de Breulh did not inflict\\nthe torture of suspense upon his young friend a moment longer than was\\nnecessary.\\n\\n“This morning, about twelve o’clock, as I was crossing the Avenue de\\nMatignon, I saw Modeste, who had been waiting for you more than an\\nhour.”\\n\\n“I could not help it.”\\n\\n“I know that. As soon as she saw me, she ran up to me at once. She was\\nterribly disappointed at not having seen you; but knowing our intimacy,\\nshe intrusted me with a letter for you from Mademoiselle de Mussidan.”\\n\\nAndre shuddered; he felt that the note contained evil tidings, with\\nwhich De Breulh was already acquainted. “Give it to me,” said he, and\\nwith trembling hands he tore open the letter and perused its contents.\\n\\n“DEAREST ANDRE,--\\n\\n“I love you, and shall ever continue to do so, but I have duties--most\\nholy ones--which I must fulfil; duties which my name and position demand\\nof me, even should the act cost me my life. We shall never meet again in\\nthis world, and this letter is the last one you will ever receive from\\nme. Before long you will see the announcement of my marriage. Pity me,\\nfor great as your wretchedness will be, it will be as nothing compared\\nto mine. Heaven have mercy upon us both! Andre, try and tear me out\\nof your heart. I have not even the right to die, and oh, my darling,\\nthis--this is the last word you will ever receive from your poor unhappy\\n\\n“SABINE.”\\n\\n\\nIf M. de Breulh had insisted upon taking Andre home with him before he\\nhanded him the letter, it was because Modeste had given him some inkling\\nof its contents. He feared that the effect would be tremendous upon\\nnerves so highly strung and sensitive as those of Andre. But he need\\nnot have been alarmed on this point. As the young painter mastered the\\ncontents of the letter his features became ghastly pale, and a shudder\\nconvulsed every nerve and muscle of his frame. With a mechanical gesture\\nhe extended the paper to M. de Breulh, uttering the one word, “Read.”\\n\\nHis friend obeyed him, more alarmed by Andre’s laconism than he could\\nhave been by some sudden explosion of passion.\\n\\n“Do not lose heart,” exclaimed he.\\n\\nBut Andre interrupted him. “Lose heart!” said he; “you do not know me.\\nWhen Sabine was ill, perhaps dying, far away from me, I did feel cast\\ndown; but now that she tells me that she loves me, my feelings are of an\\nentirely different nature.”\\n\\nM. de Breulh was about to speak, but Andre went on.\\n\\n“What is this marriage contract which my poor Sabine announces to me, as\\nif it was her death-warrant? Her parents must all along have intended\\nto break with you, but you were beforehand with them. Can they have\\nreceived a more advantageous offer of marriage already? It is scarcely\\nlikely. When she confided the secret of her life to you, she certainly\\nknew nothing of this. What terrible event has happened since then? My\\nbrave Sabine would never have submitted unless some coercion had been\\nused that she could not struggle against; she would rather have quitted\\nher father’s house for ever.”\\n\\nAs Andre uttered these words De Breulh’s mind was busy with similar\\nreflections, for Modeste had given him some hint of the approaching\\nmarriage, and had begged him to be most careful how he communicated the\\nfacts to Andre.\\n\\n“You must have noticed,” continued the young painter, “the strange\\ncoincidence between Sabine’s illness and this note. You left her happy\\nand full of hope, and an hour afterward she falls senseless, as though\\nstruck by lightning; as soon as she recovers a little she sends me this\\nterrible letter. Do you remember that Madame de Bois Arden told us that\\nduring Sabine’s illness her father and mother never left her bedside?\\nWas not this for fear lest some guilty secret of theirs might escape her\\nlips in a crisis of delirium?”\\n\\n“Yes, I remember that, and I have long had reason to imagine that there\\nis some terrible family secret in the Mussidans’ family, such as we too\\noften find among the descendants of noble houses.”\\n\\n“What can it be?”\\n\\n“That I have no means of ascertaining, but that there is one I am sure.”\\n\\nAndre turned away and paced rapidly up and down the room. “Yes,” said\\nhe, suddenly, “there is a mystery; but you and I will leave no stone\\nunturned until we penetrate it.” He drew a chair close to the side\\nof his friend, who was reclining on a couch. “Listen,” said he, “and\\ncorrect me if you fancy that I am not right in what I am saying. Do you\\nbelieve that the most terrible necessity alone has compelled Sabine to\\nwrite this letter?”\\n\\n“Most certainly.”\\n\\n“Both the Count and Countess were willing to accept you as their\\nson-in-law?”\\n\\n“Exactly so.”\\n\\n“Could M. de Mussidan have found a more brilliant match for his\\ndaughter, one who could unite so many advantages of experience and\\neducation to so enormous a fortune?”\\n\\nDe Breulh could hardly repress a smile.\\n\\n“I am not wishing to pay you a compliment,” said Andre impatiently.\\n“Reply to my question.”\\n\\n“Very well then, I admit that according to the opinion of the world, I\\nwas a most eligible suitor, and that M. de Mussidan would find it hard\\nto replace me.”\\n\\n“Then tell me how it comes about that neither the Count nor the Countess\\nhas made any effort to prevent this rupture?”\\n\\n“Their pride, perhaps, has been wounded.”\\n\\n“Not so, for Modeste tells us that on the very day you sent the letter\\nthe Count was going to call on you to break off the engagement.”\\n\\n“Yes, that is so, if we are to believe Modeste.”\\n\\nAs if to give more emphasis to his words, Andre started to his feet.\\n“This,” cried he, “this man, who has so suddenly appeared upon the\\nscene, will marry Sabine, not only against her own will, but against\\nthat of her parents, and for what reason? Who is this man, and what is\\nthe mysterious power that he possesses? His power is too great to spring\\nfrom an honorable source. Sabine is sacrificing herself to this man for\\nsome reason or other, and he, like a dastardly cur, is ready to take\\nadvantage of the nobleness of her heart.”\\n\\n“I admit the correctness of your supposition,” said he; “and now, how do\\nyou propose to act?”\\n\\n“I shall do nothing as yet,” answered the young man, with a fierce gleam\\nin his eyes. “Sabine asks me to tear her from my heart. I will affect\\nto do so for the time. Modeste believes in me, and will help me. I have\\npatience. The villain who has wrecked my life does not know me, and\\nI will only reveal myself upon the day that I hold him helpless in my\\nhand.”\\n\\n“Take care, Andre,” urged De Breulh; “a false step would ruin your hopes\\nfor ever.”\\n\\n“I will make none; as soon as I have this man’s name, I will insult him;\\nthere will be a duel, and I shall kill him--or he me.”\\n\\n“A duel will be the height of madness, and would ruin all your hopes of\\nmarriage with Sabine.”\\n\\n“The only thing that holds me back is that I do not wish that there\\nshould be a corpse between Sabine and myself. Blood on a bridal dress,\\nthey say, brings misery; and if this man is what I suspect him to be, I\\nshould be doing him too much honor if I crossed swords with him. No, I\\nmust have a deeper vengeance than this, for I can never forget that he\\nnearly caused Sabine’s death.”\\n\\nHe paused for a few seconds, and once again broke the silence which\\nreigned in the room.\\n\\n“To abuse the power that he must possess shows what a miserable wretch\\nhe must be; and men do not attain such a height of infamy by a single\\nbound. The course of his life must be full of similar crimes, growing\\ndeeper and deadlier as he moves on. I will make it my business to unmask\\nhim and to hold him up to the scorn and contempt of his fellow-men.”\\n\\n“Yes; that is the plan to pursue.”\\n\\n“And we will do so, sir. Ah! heaven help me! I say ‘we,’ for I have\\nrelied on you. The generous offer that you made to me I refused, and I\\nwas in the right in doing so; but I should now be a mere madman if I\\ndid not entreat you to grant me your aid and advice. We have both known\\nhardship and are capable of going without food or sleep, if necessity\\nrequires it of us. We have both graduated in the school of poverty and\\nsorrow. We can keep our plans to ourselves and act.”\\n\\nAndre paused, as if waiting for a reply, but his friend remained silent.\\n\\n“My plan is most simple,” resumed the young painter. “As soon as we know\\nthe fellow’s name we shall be able to act. He will never suspect us,\\nand we can follow him like his very shadow. There are professional\\ndetectives who, for a comparatively small sum, will lay bare a man’s\\nentire life. Are we not as clever as this fine fellow? We can work well\\ntogether in our different circles; you, in the world of fashion, can\\npick up intelligence that I could not hope to gain; while I, from my\\nlowly position, will study the hidden side of his life, for I can\\ntalk to the servants lounging at the front doors or the grooms at the\\npublic-houses without suspicion.”\\n\\nM. de Breulh was delighted at finding that he could have some occupation\\nwhich would fill up the dreary monotony of his life.\\n\\n“I am yours!” cried he; “and will work with you heart and soul!”\\n\\nBefore the artist could reply a loud blow was struck upon the library\\ndoor, and a woman’s voice exclaimed,--\\n\\n“Let me in, Gontran, at once.”\\n\\n“It is Madame de Bois Arden,” remarked De Breulh, drawing the bolt back;\\nand the Viscountess rushed hastily into the room and threw herself into\\na low chair.\\n\\nHer beautiful face was bedewed with tears, and she was in a terrible\\nstate of excitement.\\n\\n“What is the matter, Clotilde?” asked De Breulh kindly, as he took her\\nhand.\\n\\n“Something terrible,” answered she with a sob; “but you may be able to\\nhelp me. Can you lend me twenty thousand francs?”\\n\\nDe Breulh smiled; a heavy weight had been lifted from his heart.\\n\\n“If that is all you require, do not shed any more tears.”\\n\\n“But I want them at once.”\\n\\n“Can you give me half an hour?”\\n\\n“Yes; but lose no time.”\\n\\nDe Breulh drew a check and despatched his valet for the money.\\n\\n“A thousand thanks!” said the Viscountess; “but money is not all that I\\nrequire, I want your advice.”\\n\\nAndre was about to leave the cousins together, but the lady stopped him.\\n\\n“Pray remain, M. Andre,” said she; “you are not at all in the way;\\nbesides, I shall have to speak of some one in whom you take a very deep\\ninterest--of Mademoiselle de Mussidan, in short.\\n\\n“I never knew such a strange occurrence,” continued the Viscountess,\\nrecovering her spirits rapidly, “as that to which, my dear Gontran,\\nyou owe my visit. Well, I was just going up to dress, for I had been\\ndetained by visitor after visitor, when at two o’clock another came\\nbefore I could give my order, ‘Not at home.’ This was the Marquis de\\nCroisenois, the brother of the man who twenty years ago disappeared in\\nso mysterious a manner. I hardly knew him at all, though of course we\\nhave met in society, and he bows to me in the Bois, but that is all.”\\n\\n“And yet he called on you to-day?” remarked De Breulh.\\n\\n“Don’t interrupt me,” said the Viscountess. “Yes, he called, and that\\nis enough. He is good-looking, faultlessly dressed, and talks well. He\\nbrought a letter from an old friend of my grandmother’s, the Marchioness\\nd’Arlanges. She is a dear old thing, she uses awful language, and some\\nof her stories are quite too--you know what I mean. In the letter the\\nold lady said that the Marquis was one of her friends, and begged me for\\nher sake to do him the service he required. Of course I asked him to be\\nseated, and assured him that I would do anything that lay in my power.\\nThen he began talking about M. de Clinchain, and told me a funny story\\nabout that eccentric man and a little actress, when I heard a great\\nnoise in the anteroom. I was about to ring and inquire the cause, when\\nthe door flew open and in came Van Klopen, the ladies’ tailor, with a\\nvery inflamed countenance. I thought that he had come in a hurry because\\nhe had hit on something extremely fetching and wished me to be the first\\nto see it. But do you know what the impudent fellow wanted?”\\n\\nA smile shone in De Breulh’s eyes, as he answered,--\\n\\n“Money, perhaps!”\\n\\n“You are right,” returned the Viscountess, gravely; “he brought my bill\\ninto my very drawing-room, and handed it in before a stranger. I never\\nthought that a man who supplies the most aristocratic portion of society\\ncould have been guilty of such a piece of impertinence. I ordered him\\nto leave the room, taking it for granted that he would do so with an\\napology, but I was wrong. He flew into a rage and threatened me, and\\nswore that if I did not settle the bill on the spot, he would go to my\\nhusband. The bill was nearly twenty thousand francs; imagine my horror!\\nI was so thunderstruck at the amount that I absolutely entreated him to\\ngive me time. But my humility added to his annoyance, and taking a seat\\nin an armchair, he declared that he would not move from it until he\\nreceived his money, or had seen my husband.”\\n\\n“What was Croisenois doing all this time?” asked M. de Breulh.\\n\\n“He did nothing at first, but at this last piece of audacity he took\\nout his pocketbook, and throwing it in Van Klopen’s face, said: ‘Pay\\nyourself, you insolent scoundrel, and get out of this.’”\\n\\n“And the tailor went off?”\\n\\n“No. ‘I must give you a receipt,’ said he, and taking writing materials\\nfrom his pocket, he wrote at the foot of the bill, ‘Received from the\\nMarquis de Croisenois, on account of money owing by the Viscountess de\\nBois Arden, the sum of twenty thousand francs.’”\\n\\n“Well,” said De Breulh, looking very grave, “and after Van Klopen’s\\ndeparture, I suppose Croisenois remained to ask the favor regarding\\nwhich he had called?”\\n\\n“You are mistaken,” answered his cousin. “I had great difficulty in\\nmaking him speak; but at last he confessed that he was deeply in love\\nwith Mademoiselle de Mussidan, and entreated me to present him to her\\nparents and exert all my influence in his behalf.”\\n\\nBoth the young men started.\\n\\n“That is the man!” cried they.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” asked the Viscountess, looking from one to the\\nother.\\n\\n“That your Marquis de Croisenois is a despicable scoundrel, who had\\nimposed upon the Marchioness d’Arlanges. Just you listen to our reasons\\nfor coming to this conclusion.” And with the most perfect clearness De\\nBreulh had the whole state of the case before the Viscountess.\\n\\nThe lady listened attentively, and then said,--\\n\\n“Your premises are wrong; just let me say a word on the matter. You say\\nthat there is some man who by means of the influence that he exercises\\nover the Count and Countess, can coerce them into granting him Sabine’s\\nhand. But, my dear Gontran, an utter stranger to the family could not\\nexercise this power. Now M. de Croisenois has never entered the doors of\\nthe house, and came to me to ask for an introduction.”\\n\\nThe justness of this remark silenced De Breulh, but Andre took another\\nview of the matter.\\n\\n“This seems all right at a first glance, but still, after the\\nextraordinary scene that the Viscountess has described, I should like to\\nask a few questions. Was not Van Klopen’s behavior very unexpected?”\\n\\n“It was brutal and infamous.”\\n\\n“Are you not one of his best customers?”\\n\\n“I am, and I have spent an enormous sum with him.”\\n\\n“But Van Klopen is nasty sometimes; did he not sue Mademoiselle de\\nRiversac?” asked De Breulh.\\n\\n“But he did not, I expect, force his way into her drawing-room and\\nbehave outrageously before a perfect stranger. Do you know M. de\\nCroisenois?” returned Andre.\\n\\n“Very slightly; he is of good family, and his brother George was much\\nesteemed by all who knew him.”\\n\\n“Has he plenty of money?”\\n\\n“I do not think so, but in time he will inherit a large fortune; very\\nlikely he is over head and ears in debt.”\\n\\n“And yet he had twenty thousand francs in his pocketbook; is not that\\nrather a large sum to carry when you are simply making a morning call?\\nand it is curious, too, that it should have been the exact sum wanted.\\nThen there is another point; the pocketbook was hurled into Van Klopen’s\\nface. Did he submit without a word to such treatment?”\\n\\n“He certainly said nothing,” replied Madame de Bois Arden.\\n\\n“One question more, if you please. Did Van Klopen open the book and\\ncount the notes before he gave the receipt?”\\n\\nThe Viscountess thought for a moment.\\n\\n“I was a good deal excited,” said she at length, “but I am almost sure\\nthat I saw no notes in Van Klopen’s hands.”\\n\\nAndre’s face grew radiant.\\n\\n“Good, very good; he was told to pay himself, and yet he never looked\\nto see if the money was there, but gave a receipt at once. Of course, as\\nVan Klopen kept the pocketbook, the Marquis could have had nothing in it\\nbesides the exact sum that was required.”\\n\\n“It does seem odd,” muttered De Breulh.\\n\\n“But,” said Andre, “your bill was not exactly twenty thousand francs,\\nwas it?”\\n\\n“No,” answered the Viscountess. “I ought to have had change to the\\namount of a hundred or a hundred and twenty francs, but I suppose he was\\ntoo much excited to give it me.”\\n\\n“But for all that he could remember that he had writing materials with\\nhim, and gave you a receipt?”\\n\\nThe Viscountess was utterly bewildered.\\n\\n“And,” continued Andre, “how is it that Van Klopen knew De Croisenois’\\nname? And now, lastly, where is the receipt?”\\n\\nMadame de Bois Arden turned very pale and trembled violently.\\n\\n“Ah,” said she, “I felt sure that something was going to happen, and it\\nwas on this very point that I wanted your advice. Well, I have not got\\nthe receipt. M. de Croisenois crumpled it up in his hand and threw it\\non the table. After a while, however, he took it up and put it in his\\npocket.”\\n\\n“It is all perfectly clear,” said Andre in jubilant tones; “M. de\\nCroisenois had need of your aid, he saw that he could not easily obtain\\nit, and so sought to bind you by the means of a loan made to you at a\\ntime of great need.”\\n\\n“You are right,” said De Breulh.\\n\\nThe Viscountess’ giddy mode of action had brought her into many scrapes,\\nbut never into so terrible a one as this.\\n\\n“Great heavens!” cried she, “what do you think that M. de Croisenois\\nwill do with this receipt?”\\n\\n“He will do nothing,” answered M. de Breulh, “if you do everything to\\nadvance his suit; but pause for an instant, and he will show the hand of\\nsteel which has up to now been covered by the velvet glove.”\\n\\n“I am not alarmed at a new slander?” returned the Viscountess.\\n\\n“And why not?” answered De Breulh. “You know very well that in these\\ndays of lavish expenditure and unbridled luxury there are many women\\nin society who are so basely vile that they ruin their lovers with\\nas little compunction as their frailer sisters. To-morrow even De\\nCroisenois may say at the club, ‘On my word that little Bois Arden costs\\nme a tremendous lot,’ and hands about this receipt for twenty thousand\\nfrancs. What do you imagine that people will think then?”\\n\\n“The world knows me too well to think so ill of me.”\\n\\n“No, no, Clotilde, there is no charity in society; they will simply\\nsay that you are his mistress, and finding that the allowance from your\\nhusband is not enough for your needs, you are ruining your lover. There\\nwill be a significant laugh among the members, and in time, a very short\\ntime, the scandal in a highly sensational form will come to the ears of\\nyour husband.”\\n\\nThe Viscountess wrung her hands.\\n\\n“It is too horrible,” wailed she. “And do you know that Bois Arden would\\nput the worst construction on the whole affair, for he declares that a\\nwoman will sacrifice anything in order to outshine her sex in dress. Ah,\\nI will never run up another bill anywhere; tell me, Gontran, what I had\\nbetter do. Can you not get the receipt from De Croisenois?”\\n\\nM. de Breulh paused for a moment and then replied, “Of course I could do\\nso, but such a step would be very damaging to your reputation. I have no\\nproof; and if I went to him, he would deny everything of course, and it\\nwould make him your enemy for life.”\\n\\n“Besides,” added Andre, “you would put him on his guard, and he would\\nescape us.”\\n\\nThe unhappy woman glanced from one to the other in utter despair.\\n\\n“Then I am lost,” she exclaimed. “Am I to remain for the rest of my days\\nin this villain’s power?”\\n\\n“Not so,” returned Andre, “for I hope soon to put it out of M. de\\nCroisenois’ power to injure any one. What did he say when he asked you\\nto introduce him to the Mussidans?”\\n\\n“Nothing pointed.”\\n\\n“Then, madame, do not disturb yourself to-night. So long as he hopes you\\nwill be useful, so long he will stay his hand. Do as he wishes; never\\nallude to the receipt; introduce him and speak well of him, while I,\\naided by M. de Breulh, will do my utmost to unmask this scoundrel; and\\nas long as he believes himself to be in perfect security, our task will\\nbe an easy one.”\\n\\nJust then the servant returned from the bank, and as soon as the man had\\nleft the room De Breulh took the notes and placed them in his cousin’s\\nhand.\\n\\n“Here is the money for De Croisenois,” said he. “Take my advice, and\\ngive it to him this evening with a polite letter of thanks.”\\n\\n“A thousand thanks, Gontran; I will act as you advise.”\\n\\n“Remember you must not allude in your letter to his introduction to the\\nMussidans. What do you think, Andre?”\\n\\n“I think a receipt for the money would be a great thing,” answered he.\\n\\n“But such a demand would arouse his suspicions.”\\n\\n“I think not, madame, and I see a way of doing it; have you a maid upon\\nwhom you could rely?”\\n\\n“Yes, I have one.”\\n\\n“Good, then give the girl a letter and the notes done up in a separate\\nparcel, and tell her exactly what she is to do. When she sees the\\nMarquis, let her pretend to be alarmed at the great responsibility that\\nshe is incurring in carrying this large sum, and insist upon a receipt\\nfor her own protection.”\\n\\n“There is sound sense in that,” said De Breulh.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said the Viscountess, “Josephine will do--as sharp a girl as\\nyou could find in a day’s journey--and will manage the thing admirably.\\nTrust to me,” she continued, as a smile of hope spread over her face;\\n“I will keep De Croisenois in a good humor; he will confide in me, and\\nI will tell you everything. But, oh dear! what shall I do without Van\\nKlopen? Why, there is not another man in Paris fit to stand in his\\nshoes.”\\n\\nWith these words the Viscountess rose to leave.\\n\\n“I am completely worn out,” remarked she; “and I have a dinner-party\\nto-night. Good-bye then, until we meet again;” and with her spirits\\nevidently as joyous as ever, she tripped into her carriage.\\n\\n“Now,” said Andre, as soon as they were once more alone, “we are on\\nthe track of De Croisenois. He evidently holds Madame de Mussidan as he\\nholds Madame de Bois Arden. His is a really honorable mode of action; he\\nsurprises a secret, and then turns extortioner.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\n\\nA NEW SKIN.\\n\\nDr. Hortebise’s private arrangements were sadly upset by his being\\ncompelled to accede to the desire of Tantaine and Mascarin, and in\\ngranting hospitality to Paul Violaine; and in spite of the brilliant\\nvisions of the future, he often devoutly wished that Mascarin and his\\nyoung friend were at the other side of the world; but for all that\\nhe never thought of attempting to evade the order he had received. He\\ntherefore set himself steadily to his task, endeavoring to form Paul’s\\nmind, blunt his conscience, and prepare him for the inevitable part that\\nhe would soon have to play.\\n\\nPaul found in him a most affable companion, pleasant, witty, and gifted\\nwith great conversational powers. Five days were thus spent breakfasting\\nat well-known restaurants, driving in the Bois, and dining at clubs of\\nwhich the doctor was a member, while the evenings were passed at the\\nbanker’s. The doctor played cards with his host, while Paul and\\nFlavia conversed together in low whispers, or else hung over the piano\\ntogether. But every kind of agreeable existence comes to an end, and one\\nday Daddy Tantaine entered the room, his face radiant with delight.\\n\\n“I have secured you the sweetest little nest in the world,” cried he\\nmerrily. “It is not so fine as this, but more in accordance with your\\nposition.”\\n\\n“Where is it?” asked Paul.\\n\\nTantaine waited. “You won’t wear out much shoe leather,” said he,\\n“in walking to a certain banker’s, for your lodgings are close to his\\nhouse.”\\n\\nThat Tantaine had a splendid talent for arrangement Paul realized\\nas soon as he entered his new place of abode, which was in the Rue\\nMontmartre, and consisted of some neat, quiet rooms, just such as an\\nartist who had conquered his first difficulties would inhabit. The\\napartments were on the third floor, and comprised a tiny entrance hall,\\nsitting-room, bed and dressing room. A piano stood near the window in\\nthe sitting-room. The furniture and curtains were tasteful and in good\\norder, but nothing was new. One thing surprised Paul very much; he had\\nbeen told that the apartments had been taken and furnished three days\\nago, and yet it seemed as if they had been inhabited for years, and that\\nthe owner had merely stepped out a few minutes before. The unmade\\nbed, and the half-burnt candles in the sleeping-room added to this\\nimpression, while on the rug lay a pair of worn slippers. The fire had\\nnot gone out entirely, and a half-smoked cigar lay on the mantelpiece.\\n\\nOn the table in the sitting-room was a sheet of music paper, with a few\\nbars jotted down upon it. Paul felt so convinced that he was in another\\nperson’s rooms, that he could not help exclaiming, “But surely some one\\nhas been living in these chambers.”\\n\\n“We are in your own home, my dear boy,” said Tantaine.\\n\\n“But you took over everything, I suppose, and the original proprietor\\nsimply walked out?”\\n\\nTantaine smiled, as though an unequivocal compliment had been paid him.\\n\\n“Why, do you not know your own home?” asked he; “you have been living\\nhere for the last twelve months.”\\n\\n“I can’t understand you,” answered Paul, opening his eyes in\\nastonishment; “you must be jesting.”\\n\\n“I am entirely in earnest; for more than a year you have been\\nestablished here. If you want a proof of the correctness of my\\nassertion, call up the porter.” He ran to the head of the staircase and\\ncalled out, “Come up, Mother Brigaut.”\\n\\nIn a few moments a stout old woman came panting into the room.\\n\\n“And how are you, Mother Brigaut?” said Tantaine gayly. “I have a word\\nor two to say to you. You know that gentleman, do you not?”\\n\\n“What a question? as if I did not know one of the gentlemen lodging\\nhere?”\\n\\n“What is his name?”\\n\\n“M. Paul.”\\n\\n“What, plain M. Paul, and nothing else?”\\n\\n“Well, sir, it is not his fault if he did not know his father or\\nmother.”\\n\\n“What does he do?”\\n\\n“He is a musician; he gives lessons on the piano, and composes music.”\\n\\n“Does he do a good business?”\\n\\n“I can’t say, sir, but I should guess about two or three hundred francs\\na month; and he makes that do, for he is economical and quiet, and as\\nmodest as a young girl.”\\n\\nTantaine’s face shone all over with satisfaction.\\n\\n“You must have known M. Paul for some time, as you seem so thoroughly\\nacquainted with his habits?” said he.\\n\\n“Well, I ought to, for he has been here nearly fifteen months, and all\\nthat time I have looked after his room.”\\n\\n“Do you know where he lived before he came here?”\\n\\n“Of course I do, for I went to inquire about him in the Rue Jacob. The\\npeople there were quite cut up at his leaving, but you see this was more\\nhandy for the music publisher in the Rue Richelieu, for whom he works.”\\n\\n“Good, Mother Brigaut; that will do; you can leave us now.”\\n\\nAs Paul listened to this brief conversation, he wondered if he was awake\\nor asleep. Tantaine stood at the door and watched the woman down stairs;\\nthen he closed it carefully, and coming up to Paul, said,--\\n\\n“Well, what do you think of all this?”\\n\\nAt first Paul was so astounded that he could hardly find words in which\\nto express himself; but he remembered the words that Dr. Hortebise had\\nso often dinned into his ears during the last five days,--\\n\\n“Let nothing astonish you.”\\n\\n“I suppose,” said he at last, “that you had taught this old woman her\\nlesson beforehand.”\\n\\n“Merciful powers!” exclaimed Tantaine in tones of extreme disgust. “If\\nthese are all the ideas you have gained from what you have heard, our\\ntask will not be by any means an easy one.”\\n\\nPaul was wounded by Tantaine’s contemptuous manner.\\n\\n“I understand well enough, sir,” answered he sulkily, “that this is\\nmerely a prologue to a romantic drama.”\\n\\n“You are right, my lad,” cried he, in a more satisfied voice; “and it is\\none that is quite indispensable. The plot of the drama will be revealed\\nto you later on, and also the reward you will receive if you play your\\npart well.”\\n\\n“But why cannot you tell me everything now?”\\n\\nTantaine shook his head.\\n\\n“Have patience, you rash boy!” said he. “Rome was not built in a day. Be\\nguided by me, and follow blindly the orders of those interested in you.\\nThis is your first lesson; think it over seriously.”\\n\\n“My first lesson! What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Call it a rehearsal if you like. All that the good woman told you,”\\n continued Tantaine, “you must look upon as true; nay, it is true, and\\nwhen you believe this thoroughly, you are quite prepared for the fray,\\nbut until then you must remain quiescent. Remember this, you cannot\\nimpress others unless you firmly believe yourself. The greatest\\nimpostors of all ages have ever been their own dupes.”\\n\\nAt the word impostor, Paul seemed about to speak, but a wave of\\nTantaine’s hand silenced him.\\n\\n“You must cast aside your old skin, and enter that of another. Paul\\nViolaine, the natural son of a woman who kept a small drapery shop at\\nPoitiers, Paul Violaine, the youthful lover of Rose, no longer exists.\\nHe died of cold and hunger in a garret in the Hotel de Perou, as M. de\\nLoupins will testify when necessary.”\\n\\nThe tone in which Tantaine spoke showed his intense earnestness, and\\nwith emphatic gestures he drove each successive idea into Paul’s brain.\\n\\n“You will rid yourself of your former recollections as you do of an old\\ncoat, which you throw aside, and forget the very existence of. And not\\nonly that, but you must lose your memory, and that so entirely, that if\\nany one in the street calls out Violaine, you will never even dream of\\nturning round.”\\n\\nPaul’s brain seemed to tremble beneath the crime that his companion was\\nteaching him.\\n\\n“Who am I then?” asked he.\\n\\nA sardonic smile crossed Tantaine’s face.\\n\\n“You are just what the portress told you, Paul, and nothing more. Your\\nfirst recollections are of a Foundling Hospital, and you never knew your\\nparents. You have lived here fifteen months, and before that you resided\\nin the Rue Jacob. The portress knows no more; but if you will come with\\nme to the Rue Jacob, the people there can tell you more about your life\\nwhen you were a lodger in the house. Perhaps, if you are careful, we may\\ntake you back to your more childish days, and even find you a father.”\\n\\n“But,” said Paul, “I might be questioned regarding my past life: what\\nthen? M. Rigal or Mademoiselle Flavia might interrogate me at any\\nmoment?”\\n\\n“I see; but do not disquiet yourself. You will be furnished with all\\nnecessary papers, so that you can account for all your life during the\\ntwenty-five years you spent in this world.”\\n\\n“Then I presume that the person into whose shoes I have crept was a\\ncomposer and a musician like myself?”\\n\\nAgain Tantaine’s patience gave way, and it was with an oath that he\\nexclaimed,--\\n\\n“Are you acting the part of a fool, or are you one in reality? No one\\nhas ever been here except you. Did you not hear what the old woman said?\\nShe told you that you are a musician, a self-made one, and while waiting\\nuntil your talents are appreciated, you give lessons in music.”\\n\\n“And to whom do I _give_ them?”\\n\\nTantaine took three visiting cards from a china ornament on the\\nmantelshelf.\\n\\n“Here are three pupils of yours,” said he, “who can pay you one hundred\\nfrancs per month for two lessons a week, and two of them will assure you\\nthat you have taught them for some time. The third, Madame Grandorge, a\\nwidow, will vow that she owes all her success, which is very great, to\\nyour lessons. You will go and give these pupils their lessons at the\\nhours noted on their cards, and you will be received as if you had often\\nbeen to the house before; and remember to be perfectly at your ease.”\\n\\n“I will do my best to follow your instructions.”\\n\\n“One last piece of information. In addition to your lessons, you are in\\nthe habit of copying for certain wealthy amateurs the fragments of old\\nand almost obsolete operas, and on the piano lies the work that you\\nare engaged on for the Marquis de Croisenois, a charming composition\\nby Valserra. You see,” continued Tantaine, taking Paul by the arm, and\\nshowing him round the room, “that nothing has been forgotten, and that\\nyou have lived here for years past. You have always been a steady young\\nman, and have saved up a little money. In this drawer you will find\\neight certificates of scrip from the Bank of France.”\\n\\nPaul would have put many more questions, but the visitor was already on\\nthe threshold, and only paused to add these words,--\\n\\n“I will call here to-morrow with Dr. Hortebise.” Then, with a strange\\nsmile playing on his lips, he added, as Mascarin had before, “You will\\nbe a duke yet.”\\n\\nThe old portress was waiting for Tantaine, and as soon as she saw him\\ncoming down the stairs immersed in deep thought, out she ran toward him\\nwith as much alacrity as her corpulency would admit.\\n\\n“Did I do it all right?” asked she.\\n\\n“Hush!” answered he, pushing her quickly into her lodge, the door of\\nwhich stood open. “Hush! are you mad or drunk, to talk like this, when\\nyou do not know who is listening?”\\n\\n“I hope you were pleased with my success,” continued the woman, aghast\\nat his sudden anger.\\n\\n“You did well--very well; you piled up the evidence perfectly. I shall\\nhave an excellent report to make of you to M. Mascarin.”\\n\\n“I am so glad; and now my husband and I are quite safe?”\\n\\nThe old man shook his head with an air of doubt.\\n\\n“Well, I can hardly say that yet; the master’s arm is long and strong;\\nbut you have numerous enemies. All the servants in the house hate you,\\nand would be glad to see you come to grief.”\\n\\n“Is that really so, sir? How can that be, for both I and my husband have\\nbeen very kind to all of them?”\\n\\n“Yes, perhaps you have been lately, but how about the times before? You\\nand your husband both acted very foolishly. Article 386 cannot be got\\nnow, and two women can swear that they saw you and your husband, with a\\nbunch of keys in your hand, on the second floor.”\\n\\nThe fat woman’s face turned a sickly yellow, she clasped her hands, and\\nwhined in tones of piteous entreaty,--\\n\\n“Don’t speak so loud, sir, I beg of you.”\\n\\n“You made a terrible mistake in not coming to my master earlier, for\\nthere had been then so much talk that the matter had reached the ears of\\nthe police.”\\n\\n“But for all that, if M. Mascarin pleased----”\\n\\n“He does please, my good woman, and is quite willing to serve you. I am\\nsure that he will manage to break the inquiry; or if it must go on, he\\nhas several witnesses who will depose in your favor; but, you know, he\\ngives nothing for nothing, and must have implicit obedience.”\\n\\n“Good, kind man that he is, my husband and I would go through fire and\\nwater for him, while my daughter, Euphenice, would do anything in the\\nworld for him.”\\n\\nTantaine recoiled uneasily, for the old woman’s gratitude was so\\ndemonstrative that he feared she was about to embrace him.\\n\\n“All you have to do is to stick firmly to what you have said about\\nPaul,” continued he, when he found himself at a safe distance; “and if\\never you breathe a word of what you have been doing, he will hand you\\nover to the law, and then take care of Article 386.”\\n\\nIt was evident that this portion of the Code, that had reference to the\\nrobbery of masters by servants, struck terror into the woman’s soul.\\n\\n“If I stood on the scaffold,” said she, “I would tell the story about M.\\nPaul exactly as I have been taught.”\\n\\nHer tone was so sincere, that Tantaine addressed her in a kindlier\\nvoice.\\n\\n“Stick to that,” said he, “and I can say to you, ‘Hope.’ Upon the day on\\nwhich the young man’s business is settled you will get a paper from me,\\nwhich will prove your complete innocence, and enable you to say, ‘I have\\nbeen grossly maligned.’”\\n\\n“May the dear young man’s business be settled sharp,” said she.\\n\\n“It will not be long before it is so; but, remember, in the meantime you\\nmust keep an eye upon him.”\\n\\n“I will do so.”\\n\\n“And, remember, report to me whoever comes to see him, no matter who it\\nmay be.”\\n\\n“Not a soul can go upstairs without my seeing or hearing him.”\\n\\n“Well, if any one, save the master, Dr. Hortebise, or myself comes, do\\nnot lose a moment, but come and report.”\\n\\n“You shall know in five minutes.”\\n\\n“I wonder if that is all I have to say?” mused Tantaine. “Ah! I\\nremember: note exactly the hour at which this young man comes and goes.\\nDo not have any conversation with him; answer all questions he addresses\\nyou with a simple ‘Yes,’ or ‘No,’ and, as I said before, watch his every\\nmovement.”\\n\\nAnd Tantaine turned to go away, paying no attention to the woman’s eager\\nprotestations.\\n\\n“Keep a strict watch,” were his last words, “and, above all, see that\\nthe lad gets into no scrape.”\\n\\nIn Tantaine’s presence Paul had endeavored to assume an air of bravado,\\nbut as soon as he was left alone he was seized with such mortal terror,\\nthat he sank in a half fainting condition into an easy-chair. He felt\\nthat he was not going to put on a disguise for a brief period, but for\\nlife, and that now, though he rose in life, wealth, title, even a\\nwife would all have been obtained by a shameful and skilfully planned\\ndeception, and this deception he must keep up until the day of his\\ndeath. He shuddered as he recalled Tantaine’s words, “Paul Violaine is\\ndead.” He recalled the incidents in the life of the escaped galley-slave\\nCoignard, who, under the name of Pontis de St. Helene, absolutely\\nassumed the rank of a general officer, and took command of a domain.\\nCoignard was recognized and betrayed by an old fellow-prisoner, and\\nthis was exactly the risk that Paul knew he must run, for any of his old\\ncompanions might recognize and denounce him. Had he on such an occasion\\nsufficient presence of mind to turn laughingly to his accuser, and say,\\n“Really, my good fellow, you are in error, for I never set eyes on you\\nbefore?”\\n\\nHe felt that he could not do it, and had he any means of existence, he\\nwould have solved the difficulty by taking to flight. But he knew that\\nmen like Mascarin, Hortebise, and Tantaine were not easily eluded,\\nand his heart sank within him as he remembered the various crumbs of\\ninformation that each of these men had dropped before him. To agree to\\ntheir sordid proposals, and to remain in the position in which he was,\\nwas certainly to incur a risk, but it was one that was a long way off,\\nand might never eventually come to pass; while to change his mind would\\nbe as sure to bring down swift and condign punishment upon his head; and\\nthe weak young man naturally chose the more remote contingency, and with\\nthis determination the last qualms of his conscience expired.\\n\\nThe first night he slept badly in his new abode, for it seemed to him as\\nif the spectre of the man whose place he was to usurp was hovering\\nover his couch. But with the dawn of day, and especially when the hour\\narrived for him to go out and give his lessons, he felt his courage\\nreturn to him, though rashness perhaps would be the more correct word.\\nAnd with a mien of perfect confidence he repaired to the house of\\nMademoiselle Grandorge, the oldest of his pupils. Impelled by the same\\nfeeling of curiosity as to how Paul would comport himself, both Dr.\\nHortebise and Father Tantaine had been hanging about the Rue Montmartre,\\nand taking advantage of a heavy dray that was passing, caught a good\\nglimpse of the young man.\\n\\n“Aha,” chuckled Tantaine, delighted at seeing Paul look so brisk and\\njoyous, “our young cock is in full feather; last night he was decidedly\\nrather nervous.”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered the doctor, “he is on the right road, and I think that\\nwe shall have no further trouble with him.”\\n\\nThey then thought it would be as well to see Mother Brigaut, and were\\nreceived by the old woman with slavish deference.\\n\\n“No one has been near the dear young gentleman,” said she, in reply to\\ntheir questions. “Last night he came down about seven o’clock, and asked\\nwhere the nearest eating-house was. I directed him to Du Val’s, and he\\nwas back by eight, and by eleven I saw that he had put out his light.”\\n\\n“How about to-day?”\\n\\n“I went up stairs at nine, and he had just finished dressing. He told\\nme to get his breakfast ready, which I did. He ate well, and I said to\\nmyself, ‘Good; the bird is getting used to its cage.’”\\n\\n“And then?”\\n\\n“Then he commenced singing like a very bird, the dear fellow. His voice\\nis as sweet as his face; any woman would fall in love with him. I’m\\nprecious glad that my girl, Euphenice is nowhere near.”\\n\\n“And after that he went out?” continued Tantaine. “Did he say how long\\nhe would be away?”\\n\\n“Only to give his lessons. I suppose he expected that you would call.”\\n\\n“Very good,” remarked the old man; then, addressing Dr. Hortebise, he\\nsaid, “Perhaps, sir, you are going to the Registry Office?”\\n\\n“Yes; I want to see Mascarin.”\\n\\n“He is not there; but if you want to see him on any special matter, you\\nhad better come to our young friend’s apartment, and await his arrival.”\\n\\n“Very well, I will do so,” answered the doctor.\\n\\nHortebise was much more impressed than Paul with the skill of the hand\\nwhich had imparted such a look of long occupation to the rooms.\\n\\n“On my word, the quiet simplicity of these rooms would induce any father\\nto give his daughter to this young fellow.”\\n\\nThe old man’s silence surprised him, and turning sharply round, he was\\nstruck by the gloomy look upon his features.\\n\\n“What is the matter?” asked Hortebise, with some anxiety. “What is\\ntroubling you?”\\n\\nTantaine had thrown himself into a chair, and for a moment made no\\nreply; then, springing to his feet, he gave the expiring embers a\\nfurious kick, and faced the doctor with folded arms.\\n\\n“I see much trouble before us,” said he at last.\\n\\nThe doctor’s face grew as gloomy as that of his companion.\\n\\n“Is it Perpignan who interferes?” asked he.\\n\\n“No, Perpignan is only a fool; but he will do what I tell him.”\\n\\n“Then I really do not see--”\\n\\n“Do not see,” exclaimed Tantaine; “but luckily for us all, I am not so\\nblind. Have you forgotten this marriage of De Croisenois? There lies the\\ndanger. All had gone so smoothly, every combination had been arranged,\\nand every difficulty foreseen, and now----”\\n\\n“Well, you had made too sure, that was all; and you were unprepared for\\nthe slightest check.”\\n\\n“Not so, but I had made no attempt to guard against the impossible.”\\n\\n“Of course, there are limits to all human intelligence, but pray explain\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“This is it, then, doctor. The most adroit energy could never have\\nput in our way such an obstacle as now threatens us. Have you in\\nyour experience of society ever come across a wealthy heiress who\\nis indifferent to all the allurements of luxury, and is capable of\\ndisinterested love?”\\n\\nThe doctor smiled an expressive denial.\\n\\n“But such an heiress does exist,” said Tantaine, “and her name is Sabine\\nde Mussidan. She loves--and whom do you think?--why a mere painter, who\\nhas crossed my path three times already. He is full, too, of energy and\\nperseverance, and for these qualities I have never met his equal.”\\n\\n“What, a man without friends, money, or position, what can--”\\n\\nA rapid gesture of Tantaine’s checked his companion’s speech.\\n\\n“Unfortunately he is not without friends,” remarked the genial Tantaine.\\n“He has one friend at least; can you guess who it is? No less\\na personage than the man who was to have married Sabine, M. de\\nBreulh-Faverlay.”\\n\\nAt this unexpected news Hortebise remained silent and aghast.\\n\\n“How on earth those two met I cannot imagine. It must have been Sabine\\nthat brought them together, but the facts remain the same. They are\\nclose friends anyhow. And these two men have in their interests the very\\nwoman that I had selected to push De Croisenois’ suit.”\\n\\n“Is it possible?”\\n\\n“That is my present belief. At any rate, these three had a long\\ninterview last night, and doubtless came to a decision hostile to the\\ninterests of the Marquis.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” asked Hortebise, his lips tightly compressed with\\nanxiety. “Do you mean that they are aware of the manner by which De\\nCroisenois hopes to succeed?”\\n\\n“Look here?” answered Tantaine. “A general, on the eve of a battle,\\ntakes every precaution, but among his subordinates there are always\\nfools, if not traitors. I had arranged a pretty little scene between\\nCroisenois and Van Klopen, by which the Viscountess would be securely\\ntrapped. Unfortunately, though the rehearsal was excellent, the\\nrepresentation was simply idiotic. Neither of the actors took the least\\ntrouble to enter into the spirit of his part. I had arranged a scene\\nfull of delicacy and _finesse_, and they simply made a low, coarse\\nexhibition of it and themselves. Fools! they thought it was the easiest\\nthing in the world to deceive a woman; and finally the Marquis, to whom\\nI had recommended the most perfect discretion, opened fire, and actually\\nspoke of Sabine and his desire to press his suit. The Viscountess found,\\nwith a woman’s keen perceptions, that there was something arranged\\nbetween Van Klopen and her visitor, and hurried off to her cousin, M. de\\nBreulh-Faverlay for advice and assistance.”\\n\\nThe doctor listened to this recital, pallid and trembling.\\n\\n“Who told you all this?” gasped he.\\n\\n“No one; I discovered it; and it was easy to do so. When we have a\\nresult, it is easy to trace it back to the cause. Yes, this is what took\\nplace.”\\n\\n“Why don’t you say at once that the whole scheme is knocked on the\\nhead?” asked the doctor.\\n\\n“Because I do not think that it is; I know that we have sustained a very\\nsevere check; but when you are playing _ecarte_ and your adversary has\\nmade five points to your one, you do not necessarily throw down the\\ncards and give up the game? Not a bit; you hold on and strive to better\\nyour luck.”\\n\\nThe worthy Dr. Hortebise did not know whether the most to admire the\\nperseverance or deplore the obstinacy of the old man, and exclaimed,--\\n\\n“Why, this is utter madness; it is like plunging headlong into a deep\\npit, which you can easily see in your path.”\\n\\nTantaine gave a long, low whistle.\\n\\n“My friend,” said he, “what in your opinion would be the best course to\\npursue?”\\n\\n“I should say, without a moment’s hesitation, turn up the whole scheme,\\nand look out for another one, which, if less lucrative, would not be so\\nfull of danger. You had hoped to win the game, and with good reason too.\\nNow throw aside all feelings of wounded vanity, and accept your defeat.\\nAfter all, it does not matter to us who Mademoiselle de Mussidan\\nmarries. The great enterprise fortunately does not lie in this alliance.\\nWe have still the idea of the Company to which all old people must\\nsubscribe remaining to us, and we can work it up at once.”\\n\\nHe stopped short, abashed by the look on Tantaine’s face.\\n\\n“It strikes me,” resumed the doctor, a little mortified, “that my\\nproposal is not utterly ridiculous, and certainly deserves some\\nconsideration.”\\n\\n“Perhaps so; but is it a practical one?”\\n\\n“I see no reason why it should not be.”\\n\\n“Indeed, then, you look at the thing in a very different manner to\\nmyself. We are too far advanced, my dear doctor, to be our own masters.\\nWe must go on, and have no option to do otherwise. To beat a retreat\\nwould simply be to invite our enemies to fall upon our disorganized\\nbattalions. We must give battle; and as the first to strike has always\\nthe best chance of victory, we must strive to take the initiative.”\\n\\n“The idea is good, but these are mere words.”\\n\\n“Was the secret that we confided to De Croisenois only words?”\\n\\nThis thrust went home.\\n\\n“Do you mean that you think he would betray us?” said he.\\n\\n“Why should he not if it were to his interests to do so? Reflect,\\nCroisenois is almost at the end of his tether. We have dangled the line\\nof a princely fortune before his eyes. Do you think he would do nothing\\nif we were to say, ‘Excuse us, but we made a mistake; poor as you are,\\nso you must remain, for we do not intend to help you?’”\\n\\n“But is it necessary to say that at all?”\\n\\n“Well, at any rate, whatever we choose to say, what limit do you think\\nhe will place upon his extortions now that he holds our secret? We have\\ntaught him his music, and he will make us do our part in the chorus, and\\ncan blackmail us as well as we can others.”\\n\\n“We played a foolish game,” answered Dr. Hortebise moodily.\\n\\n“No; we had to confide in some one. Besides, the two affairs, that of\\nMadame de Mussidan and the Duke de Champdoce, ran so well together. They\\nwere the simultaneous emanations of my brain. I worked them up together,\\nand together they must stand or fall.”\\n\\n“Then you are determined to go on?”\\n\\n“Yes; more determined than ever.”\\n\\nThe doctor had been playing with his locket for some time, and the\\ncontact of the cold metal seemed to have affected his nerves; for it was\\nin a trembling voice that he replied,--\\n\\n“I vowed long ago that we should sink or swim together.” He paused,\\nand then, with a melancholy smile upon his face, continued,--“I have\\nno intention of breaking my oath, you see; but I repeat, that your road\\nseems to be a most perilous one, and I will add that I consider you\\nheadstrong and self-opinionated; but for all that I will follow you,\\neven though the path you have chosen leads to the grave. I have at this\\nmoment a something between my fingers that will save me from shame and\\ndisgrace--a little pill to be swallowed, a gasp, a little dizziness, and\\nall is over.”\\n\\nTantaine did not seem to care for the doctor’s explanation.\\n\\n“There, that will do,” said he. “If things come to the worst, you can\\nuse the contents of your locket as much as you like, but in the meantime\\nleave it alone, and do not keep jingling it in that distracting manner.\\nFor people of our stamp a danger well known is a comparatively slight\\nperil, for threats furnish us with means of defence. Woe, I say, woe to\\nthe man who crosses my path, for I will hold my hand from nothing!” He\\nstopped for a little, opened every door, and assured himself that there\\nwere no eavesdroppers, and then, in a low whisper, he said to Hortebise,\\n“Do you not see that there is but one obstacle to our success, and\\nthat is Andre? Remove him, and the whole of our machinery will work as\\nsmoothly as ever.”\\n\\nHortebise winced, as if suffering from a sudden pain.\\n\\n“Do you mean----?” asked he.\\n\\nBut Tantaine interrupted him with a low laugh, terrible to listen to.\\n\\n“And why not?” said he. “Is it not better to kill than to be killed?”\\n\\nHortebise trembled from head to foot. He had no objection to extorting\\nmoney by the basest threats, but he drew the line at murder.\\n\\n“And suppose we were found out?” muttered he.\\n\\n“Nonsense! How could we be discovered? Justice always looks for a\\nmotive; how, then could they bring it home to us? They could only find\\nout that a young lady adored by De Breulh had thrown him over in order\\nto marry Andre.”\\n\\n“Horrible!” murmured the doctor, much shocked.\\n\\n“I daresay that it is horrible, and I have no wish to proceed to\\nextremities. I only wish to speak of it as a remote possibility, and one\\nthat we may be compelled to adopt. I hate violence just as much as you\\ndo, and trust that it may not be necessary.”\\n\\nJust then the door opened, and Paul entered, a letter in his hand. He\\nseemed in excellent spirits, and shook hands with both his visitors.\\n\\nTantaine smiled sarcastically as he contrasted Paul’s high spirits with\\nthe state of depression in which he had left him not many hours ago.\\n\\n“Things are evidently going well with you,” remarked the doctor, forcing\\na smile.\\n\\n“Yes; I cannot find any reason for complaint.”\\n\\n“Have you given your lesson?”\\n\\n“Yes; what a delightful woman Madame Grandorge is! she has treated me so\\nkindly.”\\n\\n“That is a good reason for your being so happy,” remarked the doctor,\\nwith a tinge of irony in his voice.\\n\\n“Ah, that is not the only reason,” returned Paul.\\n\\n“Shall I be indiscreet if I ask the real cause, then?”\\n\\n“I am not quite sure whether I ought to speak on this matter,” said he\\nfatuously.\\n\\n“What! a love adventure already?” laughed the doctor.\\n\\nThe vanity of Paul’s nature beamed out in a smile.\\n\\n“Keep your secret, my boy,” said Tantaine, in louder accents.\\n\\nThis, of course, was enough to loosen Paul’s tongue.\\n\\n“Do you think, sir,” said he, “that I would keep anything from you?” He\\nopened the letter he held in his hand, continuing: “The portress handed\\nthis to me as I came in; she said it was left by a bank messenger. Can\\nyou guess where it came from? Let me tell you--it is from Mademoiselle\\nFlavia Rigal, and leaves no room to doubt of her sentiments toward me.”\\n\\n“Is that a fact?”\\n\\n“It is so; and whenever I choose, Mademoiselle Flavia will be only too\\nready to become Madame Paul.”\\n\\nFor an instant a bright flush crimsoned old Tantaine’s wrinkled face,\\nbut it faded away almost as soon as it appeared.\\n\\n“Then you feel happy?” asked he, with a slight quiver in his voice.\\n\\nPaul threw back his coat, and, placing his fingers in the armholes of\\nhis waistcoat, remarked carelessly,--\\n\\n“Yes, of course, I am happy, as you may suppose; but the news is not\\nparticularly startling to me. On my third visit to M. Rigal’s, the girl\\nlet me know that I need not sigh in vain.”\\n\\nTantaine covered his face with his hands as Paul passed his fingers\\nthrough his hair, and, striking what he considered an imposing attitude,\\nread as follows:--\\n\\n“MY DEAR PAUL,--\\n\\n“I was very naughty, and I repent of it. I could not sleep all night,\\nfor I was haunted by the look of sorrow I saw in your face when you took\\nleave of me. Paul, I did it to try you. Can you forgive me? You might,\\nfor I suffered much more than you could have done. Some one who loves\\nme--perhaps more than you do--has told me that when a girl shows all the\\ndepths of her heart to a man she runs the risk of his despising her. Can\\nthis be true? I hope not, Paul, for never--no, never--can I conceal my\\nfeelings; and the proof of my faith in you is that I am going now\\nto tell you all. I am sure that if your good friend and mine, Dr.\\nHortebise, came to my father with a certain request from you, it would\\nnot be rejected.\\n\\n“Your own\\n\\n“FLAVIA.”\\n\\n\\n“Did not this letter go straight to your heart?” asked Tantaine.\\n\\n“Of course it did. Why, she will have a million for her wedding\\nportion!”\\n\\nOn hearing these words, Tantaine started up with so threatening an\\naspect that Paul recoiled a step, but a warning look from the doctor\\nrestrained the old man’s indignation.\\n\\n“He is a perfect sham!” muttered he; “even his vices are mere pretence.”\\n\\n“He is our pupil, and is what we have made him,” whispered Tantaine.\\n\\nMeanwhile Tantaine had gone up to Paul, and, placing his hand\\ncaressingly on his shoulder, said,--\\n\\n“My boy, you will never know how much you owe to Mademoiselle Flavia.”\\n\\nPaul could not understand the meaning of this scene. These men had\\ndone their best to pervert his morals, and to deaden the voice of\\nhis conscience, and now that he had hoped to earn their praise by an\\naffectation of cynicism they were displeased with him. Before,\\nhowever, he could ask a question, Tantaine had completely recovered his\\nself-command.\\n\\n“My dear boy,” said he, “I am quite satisfied with you. I came here\\nto-day expecting to find you still undecided, and I am pleased with the\\nchange.”\\n\\n“But, sir--” said Paul.\\n\\n“On the contrary, you are firm and strong.”\\n\\n“Yes, he has got on so well,” said the doctor, “that we should now treat\\nhim as one of ourselves, and confide more in him. To-night, my young\\nfriend, M. Mascarin will get from Caroline Schimmel the solution of the\\nriddle that has for so long perplexed us. Be at the office to-morrow at\\nten o’clock, and you shall be told everything.”\\n\\nPaul would have asked more questions, but Tantaine cut him short with a\\nbrief good-morning, and went off hurriedly, taking the doctor with him,\\nand seemingly wishing to avoid a hazardous and unpleasant explanation.\\n\\n“Let us get out of this,” whispered he. “In another moment I should\\nhave knocked the conceited ass down. Oh, my Flavia! my poor Flavia! your\\nweakness of to-day will yet cost you very dear!”\\n\\nPaul remained rooted to the ground, with an expression of surprise and\\nconfusion upon every line of his face. All his pride and vanity had\\ngone. “I wonder,” muttered he, “what these disagreeable persons are\\nsaying about me? Perhaps laughing at my inexperience and ridiculing my\\naspirations.” The idea made him grind his teeth with rage; but he was\\nmistaken, for neither Tantaine nor the doctor mentioned his name after\\nthey had left his apartment. As they walked up the Rue Montmartre,\\nall their ideas were turning upon how it would be easiest to checkmate\\nAndre.\\n\\n“I have not yet got sufficient information to act on,” remarked Tantaine\\nmeditatively. “My present plan is to remain perfectly quiescent, and I\\nhave told Croisenois not to make a move of any kind. I have an eye\\nand ear watching and listening when they think themselves in perfect\\nprivacy. Very soon I shall fathom their plans, and then--, but in the\\nmeantime have faith in me, and do not let the matter worry you.”\\n\\nOn the boulevard Tantaine took leave of his friend.\\n\\n“I shall very likely not see you to-night, for I have an appointment at\\nthe Grand Turk with that precious young rascal, Toto Chupin. I _must_\\nfind Caroline, for I am sure that with her lies the Champdoce secret.\\nShe is very cunning, but has a weakness for drink, and, with Satan’s\\nhelp, I hope to find out the special liquor which will make her open her\\nlips freely.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\n\\nAT THE GRAND TURK.\\n\\nTantaine took a cab, and, promising the cabman a handsome gratuity if he\\nwould drive fast, stopped at the spot where the Rue Blanche intersects\\nthe Rue de Douai, and told the coachman to wait for him, and entered\\nthe house where the younger Gandelu had installed the fair Madame de\\nChantemille. It was some time before his ring at the door was answered,\\nbut at last the door was opened by a stout, red-faced girl, with an\\nuntidy cap. Upon seeing Tantaine, she uttered an exclamation of delight,\\nfor it was the cook that had been placed in Zora’s employment by M.\\nMascarin’s agency.\\n\\n“Ah, Daddy Tantaine,” said she, “you are as welcome as the sun in\\nwinter.”\\n\\n“Hush, hush,” returned the old man, gazing cautiously round him.\\n\\n“Don’t be frightened,” returned the girl. “Madame has gone to a place\\nfrom whence there is no return ticket, at least, for some time. You know\\nthe greater the value of an article the closer we keep it under lock and\\nkey.”\\n\\nTantaine gathered from this that Rose had been arrested, and his\\nastonishment appeared to be unmeasured.\\n\\n“Surely you don’t mean that she has gone to quod?” said he.\\n\\n“It is as I tell you,” answered she; “but come in, and have a glass of\\nwine, while you hear all about it.”\\n\\nShe led the old man into the dining-room, round the table in which\\na half dozen guests were seated, just concluding a late breakfast.\\nTantaine at once recognized four of the several guests as servants whom\\nhe knew from their having applied for situations at the office, and\\nthere were two men of a very unprepossessing exterior.\\n\\n“We are having a regular spree to-day,” observed the cook, handing a\\nbottle to Tantaine; “but yesterday there was not much of a jollification\\nhere, for just as I was setting about getting the dinner two fellows\\ncame in and asked for my mistress, and as soon as they saw her they\\nclapped their hands on her and said that she must come to the stone jug.\\nWhen madame heard this she shrieked so loud as to have been heard in the\\nnext street. She would not go a foot with them, clung to the furniture\\nand banisters, so they just took her up by the head and feet, and\\ncarried her down to a cab that was standing at the door. I seem to bring\\nill luck wherever I go, for this is the fourth mistress I have seen\\ntaken off in this way; but come, you are taking nothing at all.”\\n\\nBut Tantaine had had enough, and making an excuse, retired from a\\ndebauch which he saw would continue as long as the wine held out.\\n\\n“All is going well,” muttered he, as he climbed into the cab; “and now\\nfor the next one.”\\n\\nHe drove straight to the house that the elder Gandelu was building in\\nthe Champs Elysees, and putting his head out of the window, he accosted\\na light, active young fellow who was warning the foot passengers not to\\npass under the scaffolding.\\n\\n“Anything new, La Cordille?” enquired the old man.\\n\\n“No, nothing; but tell the master I am keeping a good watch.”\\n\\nFrom there Tantaine visited a footman in De Breulh’s employment, and a\\nwoman in the service of Madame de Bois Arden. Then, paying his fare,\\nhe started on foot for Father Canon’s wine shop, in the Rue St. Honore,\\nwhere he met Florestan, who was as saucy and supercilious to Tantaine\\nas he was obsequious to Mascarin. But although he paid for Florestan’s\\ndinner, all that he could extort from him was, that Sabine was terribly\\ndepressed. It was fully eight o’clock before Tantaine had got rid of\\nFlorestan, and hailing another cab, he ordered the driver to take him to\\nthe Grand Turk, in the Rue des Poissonniers.\\n\\nThe magnificent sign of the Grand Turk dances in the breeze, and invites\\nsuch youths as Toto Chupin and his companions. The whole aspect of the\\nexterior seemed to invite the passers-by to step in and try the good\\ncheer provided within,--a good _table d’hote_ at six p.m., coffee, tea,\\nliquors, and a grand ball to complete the work of digestion. A long\\ncorridor leads to this earthly Eden, and the two doors at the end of\\nit open, the one into the dining, and the other into the ball-room. A\\nmotley crew collected there for the evening meal, and on Sundays it is\\nnext to impossible to procure a seat. But the dining-room is the Grand\\nTurk’s greatest attraction, for as soon as the dessert is over the head\\nwaiter makes a sign, and dishes and tablecloths are cleared away in\\na moment. The dining-room becomes a _café_, and the click of dominoes\\ngives way to the rattle of forks, while beer flows freely. This,\\nhowever, is nothing, for, at a second signal, huge folding doors are\\nthrown open, and the strains of an orchestra ring out as an invitation\\nto the ball, to which all diners are allowed free entrance. Nothing is\\ndanced but round dances, polkas, mazurkas, and waltzes.\\n\\nThe German element was very strong at the Grand Turk, and if a gentleman\\nwished to make himself agreeable to his fair partners, it was necessary\\nfor him, at any rate, to be well up in the Alsatian dialect. The master\\nof the ceremonies had already called upon the votaries of Terpsichore to\\ntake their places for the waltz as Daddy Tantaine entered the hall. The\\nscene was a most animated one, and the air heavy with the scent of beer\\nand tobacco, and would have asphyxiated any one not used to venture into\\nsuch places.\\n\\nIt was the first time that he had ever visited the Grand Turk, and\\nyet any one observing would have sworn that he was one of the regular\\nfrequenters as he marched idly through the rooms, making constant pauses\\nat the bar. But glance around him as he might, he could see neither Toto\\nChupin nor Caroline Schimmel.\\n\\n“Have I come here for nothing,” muttered he, “or is the hour too early?”\\n\\nIt was hard to waste time thus, but at last he sat down and ordered some\\nbeer. His eyes wandered to a large picture on the wall, representing a\\nfat, eastern-looking man, with a white turban and loose, blue garments,\\nseated in a crimson chair, with his feet resting upon a yellow carpet.\\nOne hand was caressing his protuberant paunch, while the other was\\nextended toward a glass of beer. Evidently this is the Grand Turk. And\\nfinally by an odalisque, who fills his goblet with the foaming infusion\\nof malt and hops. This odalisque is very fair and stout, and some fair\\nAlsatian damsel has evidently sat as the model. As Tantaine was gazing\\nupon this wondrous work of art he heard a squeaking voice just behind\\nhim.\\n\\n“That is certainly that young rogue Chupin,” muttered he.\\n\\nHe turned sharply round, and two tables off, in a dark corner, he\\ndiscovered the young gentleman that he had been looking for. As he\\ngazed on the lad, he was not surprised that he had not recognized him\\nat first, for Toto had been strangely transmogrified, and in no degree\\nresembled the boy who had shivered in a tattered blouse in the archway\\nnear the Servants’ Registry Office. He was now gorgeous to behold. From\\nthe moment that he had got his hundred francs he had chalked out a new\\nline of life for himself, and was busy pursuing it. He had found that\\nhe could make all his friends merry, and he had succeeded. He had made a\\nselection from the most astounding wares that the Parisian tailor keeps\\non hand. He had sneered at young Gaston de Gandelu, and called him\\nan ape; but he had aped the ape. He wore a very short, light coat, a\\nwaistcoat that was hideous from its cut and brilliancy, and trousers\\nstrapped tightly under his feet. His collar was so tall and stiff, that\\nhe had the greatest difficulty in turning his head. He had gone to a\\nbarber, and his lank hair had been artistically curled. The table in\\nfront of him was covered with glasses and bottles. Two shocking\\nlooking scamps of the true barrier bully type, with loose cravats and\\nshiny-peaked caps, were seated by him, and were evidently his guests.\\nTantaine’s first impulse was to catch the debauched youth by the ear,\\nbut he hesitated for an instant and reflection conquered the impulse.\\nWith the utmost caution so that he might not attract Toto’s attention,\\nhe crept down to him, concealing himself as best he could behind one\\nof the pillars that supported the gallery, and by this manoeuvre found\\nhimself so close to the lad that he could catch every word he said.\\n\\nChupin was talking volubly.\\n\\n“Don’t you call me a swell, nor yet say that I brag,” said he. “I\\nshall always make this kind of appearance, for to work in the manner I\\npropose, a man must pay some attention to dress.”\\n\\nAt this his companions roared with laughter.\\n\\n“All right,” returned Toto. “I’m precious sharp, though you may not\\nthink so, and shall go in for all kinds of elegant accomplishments, and\\ncome out a regular masher.”\\n\\n“Wonders will never cease,” answered one of the men. “When you go on\\nyour trip for action in the Bois among the toffs, will you take me with\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Any one can go to the Bois who has money: and just tell me who are\\nthose who make money. Why, those who have plenty of cheek and a good\\nsound business. Well, I have learned my business from some real downy\\ncards, who made it pay well. Why should I not do the same?”\\n\\nWith a sickening feeling of terror, Tantaine saw that the lad was half\\ndrunk. What could he be going to say? and how much did he know? Toto’s\\nguests evidently saw that he had taken too much; but as he seemed ready\\nto let them into a secret, they paid great attention, and exchanged a\\nlook of intelligence. The young rogue’s new clothes and his liberality\\nall proved that he had found a means of gaining money; the only question\\nwas what the plan could be. To induce him to talk they passed the bottle\\nrapidly and flattered him up. The younger man of the two shook his head\\nwith a smile.\\n\\n“I don’t believe you have any business at all,” said he.\\n\\n“Nor have I, if by business you mean some low handicraft. It is brain\\nwork I mean, my boy; and that’s what I do.”\\n\\n“I don’t doubt that a bit,” answered the elder guest coaxingly.\\n\\n“Come on! Tell us what it is,” broke in the other. “You don’t expect us\\nto take your word.”\\n\\n“It is as easy as lying,” replied Toto. “Listen a bit, and you shall\\nhave the whole bag of tricks. Suppose I saw Polyte steal a couple of\\npairs of boots from a trotter-case seller’s stall----”\\n\\nPolyte interrupted the narrator, protesting so strongly that he would\\nnot commit such an act, that Tantaine perceived at once that some such\\ntrifling act of larceny weighed heavily on his conscience.\\n\\n“You needn’t kick up such a row,” returned Toto. “I am only just putting\\nit as a thing that might happen. We will say you had done the trick, and\\nthat I had twigged you. Do you know what I should go? Well, I would hunt\\nup Polyte, and say quietly, ‘Halves, old man, or I will split.’”\\n\\n“And I should give you a crack in the jaw,” returned Polyte angrily.\\n\\nForgetting his fine dress, Toto playfully put his thumb to his nose and\\nextended his fingers.\\n\\n“You would not be such an ass,” said he. “You would say to yourself, ‘If\\nI punch this chap, he will kick up no end of a row, and I shall be taken\\nup, and perhaps sent to the mill.’ No; you would be beastly civil, and\\nwould end by doing just as I wished.”\\n\\n“And this is what you call your business, is it?”\\n\\n“Isn’t it a good one--the mugs stand the racket, and the downy cards\\nprofit by it?”\\n\\n“But there is no novelty in this; it is only blackmail after all.”\\n\\n“I never said it wasn’t; but it is blackmailing perfected into a\\nsystem.”\\n\\nAs Toto made this reply he hammered on the table, calling for more\\ndrink.\\n\\n“But,” remarked Polyte, with an air of disappointment, “you don’t get\\nchances every day, and the business is often a precious poor one. You\\ncan’t always be seeing chaps prigging boots.”\\n\\n“Pooh! pooh!” answered Toto, “if you want to make money in this\\nbusiness, you must keep your eyes about you. Our customers don’t come\\nto you, but there is nothing to prevent you going to them. You can hunt\\nuntil you find them.”\\n\\n“And where are you to hunt, if you please?”\\n\\n“Ah, that’s tellings.”\\n\\nA long silence ensued, during which Tantaine was half tempted to come\\nforward. By doing so he would assuredly nip all explanations in the bud;\\nbut, on the other hand, he wanted to hear all the young rascal had\\nto say. He therefore only moved a little nearer, and listened more\\nintently.\\n\\nForgetting his curls, Toto was abstractedly passing his fingers through\\nhis hair, and reflecting with all the wisdom of a muddled brain.\\nFinally, he came to the conclusion that he might speak, and, leaning\\nforward, he whispered,--\\n\\n“You won’t peach if I tell you the dodge?”\\n\\nHis companions assured him that he might have every confidence in them.\\n\\n“Very well; I make my money in the Champs Elysees, and sometimes get a\\nharvest twice a day.”\\n\\n“But there are no shoemakers’ shops there.”\\n\\n“You are a fool,” answered Toto contemptuously. “Do you think I\\nblackmail thieves? That wouldn’t be half good enough. Honest people, or\\nat least people who call themselves honest, are my game. These are the\\nones who can be made to pay up.”\\n\\nTantaine shuddered; he remembered that Mascarin had made use of the same\\nexpression, and at once surmised that Toto must have had an occasional\\near to the keyhole.\\n\\n“But,” objected Polyte, “honest people have no occasion to pay up.”\\n\\nToto struck his glass so heavily on the table that it flew to shivers.\\n\\n“Will you let me speak?” said he.\\n\\n“Go on, go on, my boy,” returned his friend.\\n\\n“Well, when I’m hard up for cash, I go into the Champs Elysees, and take\\na seat on one of the benches. From there I keep an eye on the cabs and\\nsee who gets out of them. If a respectable woman does so, I am sure of\\nmy bird.”\\n\\n“Do you think you know a respectable woman when you see her?”\\n\\n“I should think that I did. Well, when a respectable woman gets out of a\\ncab where she ought not to have been, she looks about her on all sides,\\nfirst to the right and then to the left, settles her veil, and, as soon\\nas she is sure that no one is watching her, sets off as if old Nick was\\nbehind her.”\\n\\n“Well, what do you do then?”\\n\\n“Why, I take the number of the cab, and follow the lady home. Then\\nI wait until she has had time to get to her own rooms, and go to the\\nporter and say, ‘Will you give me the name of the lady who has just come\\nin?’”\\n\\n“And do you think the porter is fool enough to do so?”\\n\\n“Not a bit; I always take the precaution of having a delicate little\\npurse in my pocket; and when the man says, as he always does, ‘I don’t\\nknow,’ I pull out the purse, and say, ‘I am sorry for that, for she\\ndropped this as she came in, and I wanted to return it to her.’ The\\nporter at once becomes awfully civil; he gives the name and number,\\nand up I go. The first time I content myself with finding out if she is\\nmarried or single. If she is single, it is no go; but if the reverse, I\\ngo on with the job.”\\n\\n“Why, what do you do next?”\\n\\n“Next morning I go there, and hang about until I see the husband go out.\\nThen I go upstairs, and ask for the wife. It is ticklish work then, my\\nlads; but I say, ‘Yesterday, madame, I was unlucky enough to leave my\\npocketbook in cab number so-and-so. Now, as I saw you hail the vehicle\\nimmediately after I had left it, I have come to ask you if you saw my\\npocketbook.’ The lady flies into a rage, denies all knowledge of\\nthe book, and threatens to have me turned out. Then, with the utmost\\npoliteness, I say, ‘I see, madame, that there is nothing to be done\\nbut to communicate the matter to your husband.’ Then she gets alarmed,\\nand--she pays.”\\n\\n“And you don’t see any more of her?”\\n\\n“Not that day; but when the funds are low, I call and say, ‘It is I\\nagain, madame; I am the poor young man who lost his money in such and\\nsuch a cab on a certain day of the month.’ And so the game goes on. A\\ndozen such clients give a fellow a very fair income. Now, perhaps, you\\nunderstand why I am always so well dressed, and always have money in my\\npocket. When I was shabbily attired, they offered me a five-franc piece,\\nbut now they come down with a flimsy.”\\n\\nThe young wretch spoke the truth; for to many women, who in a mad moment\\nof passion may have forgotten themselves, and been tracked to their\\nhomes by some prowling blackmailer, life has been an endless journey of\\nagony. Every knock at the door makes them start, and every footfall on\\nthe staircase causes a tremor as they think that the villain has come to\\nbetray their guilty secret.\\n\\n“That is all talk,” said Polyte; “such things are never done.”\\n\\n“They _are_ done,” returned Toto sulkily.\\n\\n“Have you ever tried the dodge yourself, then?” sneered Polyte.\\n\\nAt another time Chupin would have lied, but the fumes of the drink he\\nhad taken, added to his natural self-conceit, had deprived him of all\\njudgment.\\n\\n“Well,” muttered he, “if I have not done it myself exactly, I have seen\\nothers practise it often enough--on a much larger scale, it is true;\\nbut one can always do things in a more miniature fashion with perhaps a\\nbetter chance of success.”\\n\\n“What! _you_ have seen this done?”\\n\\n“Of course I have.”\\n\\n“And had you a share in the swag?”\\n\\n“To a certain extent. I have followed the cabs times without number, and\\nhave watched the goings on of these fine ladies and gentlemen; only I\\nwas working for others, like the dog that catches the hare, and never\\nhas a bit of it to eat. No, all I got was dry bread, with a kick or a\\ncuff for dessert. I sha’n’t put up with it any longer, and have made up\\nmy mind to open on my own account.”\\n\\n“And who has been employing you?”\\n\\nA flash of sense passed through Chupin’s muddled brain. He had never\\nwished to injure Mascarin, but merely to increase his own importance by\\nextolling the greatness of his employer.\\n\\n“I worked for people who have no equal in Paris,” said he proudly. “They\\ndon’t mince matters either, I can tell you; and they have more money\\nthan you could count in six months. There is not a thing they cannot do\\nif they desire; and if I were to tell you----”\\n\\nHe stopped short, his mouth wide open, and his eyes dilated with terror,\\nfor before him stood old Daddy Tantaine.\\n\\nTantaine’s face had a most benign expression upon it, and in a most\\npaternal voice he exclaimed,--\\n\\n“And so here you are at last, my lad; and, bless me, how fine! why, you\\nlook like a real swell.”\\n\\nBut Toto was terribly disconcerted. The mere appearance of Tantaine\\ndissipated the fumes of liquor which had hitherto clouded the boy’s\\nbrain, and by degrees he recollected all that he had said, and,\\nbecoming conscious of his folly, had a vague idea of some swift-coming\\nretribution. Toto was a sharp lad, and he was by no means deceived by\\nTantaine’s outward semblance of friendliness, and he almost felt as if\\nhis life depended on the promptness of his decision. The question was,\\nhad the old man heard anything of the preceding conversation?\\n\\n“If the old rogue has been listening,” said he to himself, “I am in a\\nhole, and no mistake.”\\n\\nIt was, therefore, with a simulated air of ease that he answered,--\\n\\n“I was waiting for you, sir, and it was out of respect to you that I put\\non my very best togs.”\\n\\n“That was very nice of you; I ought to thank you very much. And now,\\nwill you--”\\n\\nToto’s courage was coming back to him rapidly.\\n\\n“Will you take a glass of beer, or a liquor of brandy, sir?” said he.\\n\\nBut Daddy Tantaine excused himself on the plea that he had just been\\ndrinking.\\n\\n“That is all the more reason for being thirsty,” remarked Toto. “My\\nfriends and I have drunk the contents of all these bottles since\\ndinner.”\\n\\nTantaine raised his shabby hat at this semi-introduction, and the\\ntwo roughs bowed smoothly. They were not entirely satisfied with the\\nappearance of the new-comer, and thought that this would be a good\\nmoment for taking leave of their host. The waltz had just concluded, and\\nthe master of the ceremonies was repeating his eternal refrain of--“Take\\nyour places, ladies and gentlemen;” and taking advantage of the noise,\\nToto’s friends shook hands with their host and adroitly mixed with the\\ncrowd.\\n\\n“Good fellows! jolly fellows;” muttered Toto, striving to catch a last\\nglimpse of them.\\n\\nTantaine gave a low, derisive whistle. “My lad,” said he, “you keep\\nexecrable company, and one day you will repent it.”\\n\\n“I can look after myself, sir.”\\n\\n“Do as you like, my lad; it is no business of mine. But, take my word\\nfor it, you will come to grief some day. I have told you that often\\nenough.”\\n\\n“If the old rascal suspected anything,” thought Toto, “he would not talk\\nin this way.”\\n\\nWretched Toto! he did not know that when his spirits were rising\\nthe danger was terribly near, for Tantaine was just then saying to\\nhimself,--\\n\\n“Ah! this lad is much too clever--too clever by half. If I were going\\non with the business, and could make it worth his while, how useful he\\nwould be to me! but just now it would be most imprudent to allow him to\\nwander about and jabber when he gets drunk.”\\n\\nMeanwhile Toto had called a waiter, and, flinging a ten-franc piece on\\nthe table, said haughtily: “Take your bill out of that.” But Tantaine\\npushed the money back toward the lad, and, drawing another ten-franc\\npiece from his pocket, gave it to the waiter.\\n\\nThis unexpected act of generosity put the lad in the best possible\\nhumor. “All the better for me,” exclaimed he; “and now let us hunt up\\nCaroline Schimmel.”\\n\\n“Is she here? I could not find her.”\\n\\n“Because you did not know where to look for her. She is at cards in the\\ncoffee-room. Come along, sir.”\\n\\nBut Tantaine laid his hand upon the boy’s arm.\\n\\n“One moment,” said he. “Did you tell the woman just what I ordered you\\nto say?”\\n\\n“I did not omit a single word.”\\n\\n“Tell me what you said, then.”\\n\\n“For five days,” began the lad solemnly, “your Toto has been your\\nCaroline’s shadow. We have played cards until all sorts of hours, and\\nI took care that she should always win. I confided to her that I had a\\njolly old uncle,--a man not without means, a widower, and crazy to be\\nmarried again,--who had seen her and had fallen in love with her.”\\n\\n“Good! my lad, good! and what did she say?”\\n\\n“Why, she grinned like half a dozen cats; only she is a bit artful, and\\nI saw at once that she thought I was after her cards, but the mention of\\nmy uncle’s property soon chucked her off that idea.”\\n\\n“Did you give my name?”\\n\\n“Yes, at the end, I did. I knew that she had seen you, and so I kept it\\nback as long as I could; but as soon as I mentioned it she looked rather\\nconfused, and cried out: ‘I know him quite well.’ So you see, sir, all\\nyou have now is to settle a day for the marriage. Come on; she expects\\nyou.”\\n\\nToto was right. The late domestic of the Duke de Champdoce was playing\\ncards; but as soon as she caught sight of Toto and his pretended uncle,\\nin spite of her holding an excellent hand, she threw up her cards, and\\nreceived him with the utmost civility. Toto looked on with delight.\\nNever had he seen the old rascal (as he inwardly called him in his\\nheart) so polite, agreeable, and talkative. It was easy to see that\\nCaroline Schimmel was yielding to his fascinations, for she had never\\nhad such extravagant compliments whispered in her ear in so persuasive a\\ntone. But Tantaine did not confine his attentions to wine only: he first\\nordered a bowl of punch, and then followed that up by a bottle of the\\nbest brandy. All the old man’s lost youth seemed to have come back\\nto him: he sang, he drank, and he danced. Toto watched them in utter\\nsurprise, as the old man whirled the clumsy figure of the woman round\\nthe room.\\n\\nAnd he was rewarded for this tremendous exertion, for by ten o’clock she\\nhad consented, and Caroline left the Grand Turk on the arm of her future\\nhusband, having promised to take supper with him.\\n\\nNext morning, when the scavengers came down from Montmartre to ply their\\nmatutinal avocations, they found the body of a woman lying on her face\\non the pavement. They raised her up and carried her to an hospital.\\nShe was not dead, as had been at first supposed; and when the unhappy\\ncreature came to her senses, she said that her name was Caroline\\nSchimmel, that she had been to supper at a restaurant with her\\nbetrothed, and that from that instant she remembered nothing. At her\\nrequest, the surgeon had her conveyed to her home in the Rue Mercadet.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII.\\n\\nTHE LAST LINK.\\n\\nFor some days M. Mascarin had not shown himself at the office, and\\nBeaumarchef was terribly harassed with inquiries regarding his absent\\nmaster. Mascarin, on the day after the evening on which Tantaine had\\nmet Caroline Schimmel at the Grand Turk, was carefully shut up in\\nhis private room; his face and eyes were red and inflamed, and he\\noccasionally sipped a glass of some cooling beverage which stood before\\nhim, and his compressed lips and corrugated brow showed how deeply he\\nwas meditating. Suddenly the door opened, and Dr. Hortebise entered the\\nroom.\\n\\n“Well!” exclaimed Mascarin, “have you seen the Mussidans, as I told you\\nto do.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” answered Hortebise briskly; “I saw the Countess, and told\\nher how pressing the holders of her letters were growing, and urged on\\nher the necessity for immediate action. She told me that both she and\\nher husband had determined to yield, and that Sabine, though evidently\\nbroken-hearted, would not oppose the marriage.”\\n\\n“Good,” said Mascarin; “and now, if Croisenois only follows out the\\norders that I have given him, the marriage will take place without\\nthe knowledge of either De Breulh or Andre. Then we need fear them no\\nlonger. The prospectus of the new Company is ready, and can be issued\\nalmost immediately; but we meet to-day to discuss not that matter, but\\nthe more important one of the heir to the Champdoce title.”\\n\\nA timid knock at the door announced the arrival of Paul who came in\\nhesitatingly, as if doubtful what sort of a reception he might receive;\\nbut Mascarin gave him the warmest possible welcome.\\n\\n“Permit me,” said he, “to offer you my congratulations on having won\\nthe affections of so estimable and wealthy a young lady as Mademoiselle\\nFlavia. I may tell you that a friend of mine has informed me of the very\\nflattering terms in which her father, M. Rigal, spoke of you, and I can\\nassure you that if our mutual friend Dr. Hortebise were to go to the\\nbanker with an offer of marriage on your part, you have no cause to\\ndread a refusal.”\\n\\nPaul blushed with pleasure, and as he was stammering out a few words,\\nthe door opened for the third time, and Catenac made his appearance. To\\ncover the lateness of his arrival, he had clothed his face in smiles,\\nand advanced with outstretched hands toward his confederates; but\\nMascarin’s look and manner were so menacing, that he recoiled a few\\nsteps and gazed on him with an expression of the utmost wonder and\\nsurprise.\\n\\n“What is the meaning of this reception?” asked he.\\n\\n“Can you not guess?” returned Mascarin, his manner growing more and more\\nthreatening. “I have sounded the lowest depths of your infamy. I was\\nsure the other day that you meant to turn traitor, but you swore to the\\ncontrary, and you--”\\n\\n“On my honor--”\\n\\n“It is useless. One word from Perpignan set us on the right track. Were\\nyou or were you not ignorant that the Duke de Champdoce had a certain\\nway of recognizing his son, and that was by a certain ineffaceable\\nscar?”\\n\\n“It had escaped my memory----”\\n\\nThe words faded from his lips, for even his great self-command failed\\nhim under Mascarin’s disdainful glance.\\n\\n“Let me tell you what I think of you,” said the latter. “I knew that you\\nwere a coward and a traitor. Even convicts keep faith with each other,\\nand I had not thought you so utterly infamous.”\\n\\n“Then why have you forced me to act contrary to my wishes?”\\n\\nThis reply exasperated Mascarin so much that he grasped Catenac by the\\nthroat, and shook him violently.\\n\\n“I made use of you, you viper,” said he, “because I had placed you in\\nsuch a position that you could not harm us. And now you will serve\\nme because I will show you that I can take everything from you--name,\\nmoney, liberty, and _life_. All depends upon our success. If we fail,\\nyou fall into an abyss of the depth and horrors of which you can have\\nno conception. I knew with whom I had to deal, and took my measures\\naccordingly. The most crushing proofs of your crime are in the hands of\\na person who has precise orders how to act. When I give the signal, he\\nmoves; and when he moves, you are utterly lost.”\\n\\nThere was something so threatening in the silence that followed this\\nspeech that Paul grew faint with apprehension.\\n\\n“And,” went on Mascarin, “it would be an evil day for you if anything\\nwere to happen to Hortebise, Paul, or myself; for if one of us were to\\ndie suddenly, your fate would be sealed. You cannot say that you have\\nnot been warned.”\\n\\nCatenac stood with his head bent upon his breast, rooted to the ground\\nwith terror. He felt that he was bound, and gagged, and fettered hand\\nand foot. Mascarin swallowed some of the cooling draught that stood\\nbefore him, and tranquilly commenced,--\\n\\n“Suppose, Catenac, that I were to tell you that I know far more of the\\nChampdoce matter than you do; for, after all, your knowledge is only\\nderived from what the Duke has told you. You think that you have hit\\nupon the truth; you were never more mistaken in your life. I, perhaps\\nyou are unaware, have been many years engaged in this matter. Perhaps\\nyou would like to know how I first thought of the affair. Do you\\nremember that solicitor who had an office near the Law Courts, and did\\na great deal of blackmail business? If you do, you must remember that he\\ngot two years’ hard labor.”\\n\\n“Yes, I remember the man,” returned Catenac in a humble voice.\\n\\n“He used,” continued Mascarin, “to buy up waste paper, and search\\nthrough the piles he had collected for any matters that might be\\nconcealed in the heterogeneous mass. And many things he must have found.\\nIn what sensational case have not letters played a prominent part? What\\nman is there who has not at one time or other regretted that he has had\\npen and ink ready to his hand? If men were wise, they would use those\\npatent inks, which fade from the paper in a few days. I followed his\\nexample, and, among other strange discoveries, I made this one.”\\n\\nHe took from his desk a piece of paper--ragged, dirty, and creased--and,\\nhanding it to Hortebise and Paul, said,--\\n\\n“Read!”\\n\\nThey did so, and read the following strange word:\\n\\n“TNAFNEERTONIOMZEDNEREITIPZEYAETNECONNISIUSEJECARG;”\\n\\nwhile underneath was written in another hand the word, “Never.”\\n\\n“It was evident that I had in my hands a letter written in cipher, and I\\nconcluded that the paper contained some important secret.”\\n\\nCatenac listened to this narrative with an air of contempt, for he was\\none of those foolish men who never know when it is best for them to\\nyield.\\n\\n“I daresay you are right,” answered he with a slight sneer.\\n\\n“Thank you,” returned Mascarin coolly. “At any rate, I was deeply\\ninterested in solving this riddle, the more as I belonged to an\\nassociation which owes its being and position to its skill in\\npenetrating the secrets of others. I shut myself up in my room, and\\nvowed that I would not leave it until I had worked out the cipher.”\\n\\nPaul, Hortebise, and Catenac examined the letter curiously, but could\\nmake nothing of it.\\n\\n“I can’t make head or tail of it,” said the doctor impatiently.\\n\\nMascarin smiled as he took back the paper, and remarked,--\\n\\n“At first I was as much puzzled as you were, and more than once was\\ntempted to throw the document into the waste-paper basket, but a secret\\nfeeling that it opened a way to all our fortunes restrained me. Of\\ncourse there was the chance that I might only decipher some foolish\\njest, and no secret at all, but still I went on. If the commencement of\\nthe word was written in a woman’s hand, the last word had evidently\\nbeen added by a man. But why should a cryptogram have been used? Was it\\nbecause the demand was of so dangerous and compromising a character that\\nit was impossible to put it in plain language? If so, why was the\\nlast word not in cipher? Simply because the mere rejection of what was\\ncertainly a demand would in no manner compromise the writer. You will\\nask how it happens that demand and rejection are both on the same sheet\\nof paper. I thought this over, and came to the conclusion that the\\nletter had once been meant for the post, but had been sent by hand.\\nPerhaps the writers may have occupied rooms in the same house. The\\nwoman, in the anguish of her soul, may have sent the letter by a servant\\nto her husband, and he, transported by rage, may have hurriedly\\nscrawled this word across it, and returned it again: ‘Take this to your\\nmistress.’ Having settled this point, I attacked the cipher, and, after\\nfourteen hours’ hard work, hit upon its meaning.\\n\\n“Accidentally I held the piece of paper between myself and the light,\\nwith the side on which the writing was turned from me, and read it at\\nonce. It was a cryptogram of the simplest kind, as the letters forming\\nthe words were simply reversed. I divided the letters into words,\\nand made out this sentence: ‘_Grace, je suis innocente. Ayez pitie;\\nrendez-moi notre enfant_ (Mercy, I am innocent. Give me back our son).’”\\n\\nHortebise snatched up the paper and glanced at it.\\n\\n“You are right,” said he; “it is the art of cipher writing in its\\ninfancy.”\\n\\n“I had succeeded in reading it,--but how to make use of it! The mass of\\nwaste paper in which I found it had been purchased from a servant in\\na country house near Vendome. A friend of mine, who was accustomed to\\ndrawing plans and maps, came to my aid, and discovered some faint\\nsigns of a crest in one corner of the paper. With the aid of a powerful\\nmagnifying glass, I discovered it to be the cognizance of the ducal\\nhouse of Champdoce. The light that guided me was faint and uncertain,\\nand many another man would have given up the quest. But the thought was\\nwith me in my waking hours, and was the companion of my pillow during\\nthe dark hours of the night. Six months later I knew that it was the\\nDuchess who had addressed this missive to her husband, and why she had\\ndone so. By degrees I learned all the secret to which this scrap of\\npaper gave me the clue; and if I have been a long while over it, it is\\nbecause one link was wanting which I only discovered yesterday.”\\n\\n“Ah,” said the doctor, “then Caroline Schimmel has spoken.”\\n\\n“Yes; drink was the magician that disclosed the secret that for twenty\\nyears she had guarded with unswerving fidelity.”\\n\\nAs Mascarin uttered these words he opened a drawer, and drew from it a\\nlarge pile of manuscript, which he waved over his head with an air of\\ntriumph.\\n\\n“This is the greatest work that I have ever done,” exclaimed he. “Listen\\nto it, Hortebise, and you shall see how it is that I hold firmly, at\\nthe same time, both the Duke and Duchess of Champdoce, and Diana the\\nCountess of Mussidan. Listen to me, Catenac,--you who distrusted me, and\\nwere ready to play the traitor, and tell me if I do not grasp success in\\nmy strong right hand.” Then, holding out the roll of papers to Paul, he\\ncried, “And do you, my dear boy, take this and read it carefully. Let\\nnothing escape you, for there is not one item, however trivial it may\\nseem to you, that has not its importance. It is the history of a great\\nand noble house, and one in which you are more interested than you may\\nthink.”\\n\\nPaul opened the manuscript, and, in a voice which quivered with emotion,\\nhe read the facts announced by Mascarin, which he had entitled “The\\nMystery of Champdoce.”',\n",
       " \"CHAPTER I. LOVE ON THE OCEAN\\n\\n\\nNothing is so easy as falling in love on a long sea voyage, except\\nfalling out of love. Especially was this the case in the days when the\\nwooden clippers did finely to land you in Sydney or in Melbourne under\\nthe four full months. We all saw far too much of each other, unless,\\nindeed, we were to see still more. Our superficial attractions mutually\\nexhausted, we lost heart and patience in the disappointing strata\\nwhich lie between the surface and the bed-rock of most natures. My own\\nexperience was confined to the round voyage of the Lady Jermyn, in the\\nyear 1853. It was no common experience, as was only too well known\\nat the time. And I may add that I for my part had not the faintest\\nintention of falling in love on board; nay, after all these years,\\nlet me confess that I had good cause to hold myself proof against such\\nweakness. Yet we carried a young lady, coming home, who, God knows,\\nmight have made short work of many a better man!\\n\\nEva Denison was her name, and she cannot have been more than nineteen\\nyears of age. I remember her telling me that she had not yet come out,\\nthe very first time I assisted her to promenade the poop. My own name\\nwas still unknown to her, and yet I recollect being quite fascinated by\\nher frankness and self-possession. She was exquisitely young, and yet\\nludicrously old for her years; had been admirably educated, chiefly\\nabroad, and, as we were soon to discover, possessed accomplishments\\nwhich would have made the plainest old maid a popular personage on board\\nship. Miss Denison, however, was as beautiful as she was young, with the\\nbloom of ideal health upon her perfect skin. She had a wealth of lovely\\nhair, with strange elusive strands of gold among the brown, that drowned\\nher ears (I thought we were to have that mode again?) in sunny ripples;\\nand a soul greater than the mind, and a heart greater than either, lay\\nsleeping somewhere in the depths of her grave, gray eyes.\\n\\nWe were at sea together so many weeks. I cannot think what I was made of\\nthen!\\n\\nIt was in the brave old days of Ballarat and Bendigo, when ship after\\nship went out black with passengers and deep with stores, to bounce home\\nwith a bale or two of wool, and hardly hands enough to reef topsails\\nin a gale. Nor was this the worst; for not the crew only, but, in many\\ncases, captain and officers as well, would join in the stampede to the\\ndiggings; and we found Hobson's Bay the congested asylum of all manner\\nof masterless and deserted vessels. I have a lively recollection of our\\nskipper's indignation when the pilot informed him of this disgraceful\\nfact. Within a fortnight, however, I met the good man face to face upon\\nthe diggings. It is but fair to add that the Lady Jermyn lost every\\nofficer and man in the same way, and that the captain did obey tradition\\nto the extent of being the last to quit his ship. Nevertheless, of\\nall who sailed by her in January, I alone was ready to return at the\\nbeginning of the following July.\\n\\nI had been to Ballarat. I had given the thing a trial. For the most\\nodious weeks I had been a licensed digger on Black Hill Flats; and I had\\nactually failed to make running expenses. That, however, will surprise\\nyou the less when I pause to declare that I have paid as much as four\\nshillings and sixpence for half a loaf of execrable bread; that my mate\\nand I, between us, seldom took more than a few pennyweights of gold-dust\\nin any one day; and never once struck pick into nugget, big or little,\\nthough we had the mortification of inspecting the “mammoth masses” of\\nwhich we found the papers full on landing, and which had brought the\\ngold-fever to its height during our very voyage. With me, however, as\\nwith many a young fellow who had turned his back on better things, the\\nmalady was short-lived. We expected to make our fortunes out of hand,\\nand we had reckoned without the vermin and the villainy which rendered\\nus more than ever impatient of delay. In my fly-blown blankets I dreamt\\nof London until I hankered after my chambers and my club more than after\\nmuch fine gold. Never shall I forget my first hot bath on getting back\\nto Melbourne; it cost five shillings, but it was worth five pounds, and\\nis altogether my pleasantest reminiscence of Australia.\\n\\nThere was, however, one slice of luck in store for me. I found the dear\\nold Lady Jermyn on the very eve of sailing, with a new captain, a new\\ncrew, a handful of passengers (chiefly steerage), and nominally no cargo\\nat all. I felt none the less at home when I stepped over her familiar\\nside.\\n\\nIn the cuddy we were only five, but a more uneven quintette I defy you\\nto convene. There was a young fellow named Ready, packed out for\\nhis health, and hurrying home to die among friends. There was an\\noutrageously lucky digger, another invalid, for he would drink nothing\\nbut champagne with every meal and at any minute of the day, and I have\\nseen him pitch raw gold at the sea-birds by the hour together. Miss\\nDenison was our only lady, and her step-father, with whom she was\\ntravelling, was the one man of distinction on board. He was a Portuguese\\nof sixty or thereabouts, Senhor Joaquin Santos by name; at first it was\\nincredible to me that he had no title, so noble was his bearing; but\\nvery soon I realized that he was one of those to whom adventitious\\nhonors can add no lustre. He treated Miss Denison as no parent ever\\ntreated a child, with a gallantry and a courtliness quite beautiful to\\nwatch, and not a little touching in the light of the circumstances under\\nwhich they were travelling together. The girl had gone straight from\\nschool to her step-father's estate on the Zambesi, where, a few months\\nlater, her mother had died of the malaria. Unable to endure the place\\nafter his wife's death, Senhor Santos had taken ship to Victoria, there\\nto seek fresh fortune with results as indifferent as my own. He was\\nnow taking Miss Denison back to England, to make her home with other\\nrelatives, before he himself returned to Africa (as he once told me) to\\nlay his bones beside those of his wife. I hardly know which of the pair\\nI see more plainly as I write--the young girl with her soft eyes and her\\nsunny hair, or the old gentleman with the erect though wasted figure,\\nthe noble forehead, the steady eye, the parchment skin, the white\\nimperial, and the eternal cigarette between his shrivelled lips.\\n\\nNo need to say that I came more in contact with the young girl. She was\\nnot less charming in my eyes because she provoked me greatly as I came\\nto know her intimately. She had many irritating faults. Like most young\\npersons of intellect and inexperience, she was hasty and intolerant in\\nnearly all her judgments, and rather given to being critical in a crude\\nway. She was very musical, playing the guitar and singing in a style\\nthat made our shipboard concerts vastly superior to the average of their\\norder; but I have seen her shudder at the efforts of less gifted folks\\nwho were also doing their best; and it was the same in other directions\\nwhere her superiority was less specific. The faults which are most\\nexasperating in another are, of course, one's own faults; and I confess\\nthat I was very critical of Eva Denison's criticisms. Then she had\\na little weakness for exaggeration, for unconscious egotism in\\nconversation, and I itched to tell her so. I felt so certain that the\\ngirl had a fine character underneath, which would rise to noble heights\\nin stress or storm: all the more would I long now to take her in hand\\nand mould her in little things, and anon to take her in my arms just as\\nshe was. The latter feeling was resolutely crushed. To be plain, I had\\nendured what is euphemistically called “disappointment” already; and,\\nnot being a complete coxcomb, I had no intention of courting a second.\\n\\nYet, when I write of Eva Denison, I am like to let my pen outrun my\\ntale. I lay the pen down, and a hundred of her sayings ring in my\\nears, with my own contradictious comments, that I was doomed so soon\\nto repent; a hundred visions of her start to my eyes; and there is the\\ntrade-wind singing in the rigging, and loosening a tress of my darling's\\nhair, till it flies like a tiny golden streamer in the tropic sun.\\nThere, it is out! I have called her what she was to be in my heart ever\\nafter. Yet at the time I must argue with her--with her! When all my\\ncourage should have gone to love-making, I was plucking it up to sail as\\nnear as I might to plain remonstrance! I little dreamt how the ghost of\\nevery petty word was presently to return and torture me.\\n\\nSo it is that I can see her and hear her now on a hundred separate\\noccasions beneath the awning beneath the stars on deck below at noon\\nor night but plainest of all in the evening of the day we signalled\\nthe Island of Ascension, at the close of that last concert on the\\nquarter-deck. The watch are taking down the extra awning; they are\\nremoving the bunting and the foot-lights. The lanterns are trailed\\nforward before they are put out; from the break of the poop we watch the\\nvivid shifting patch of deck that each lights up on its way. The stars\\nare very sharp in the vast violet dome above our masts; they shimmer on\\nthe sea; and our trucks describe minute orbits among the stars, for the\\ntrades have yet to fail us, and every inch of canvas has its fill of the\\ngentle steady wind. It is a heavenly night. The peace of God broods upon\\nHis waters. No jarring note offends the ear. In the forecastle a voice\\nis humming a song of Eva Denison's that has caught the fancy of the men;\\nthe young girl who sang it so sweetly not twenty minutes since who\\nsang it again and again to please the crew she alone is at war with our\\nlittle world she alone would head a mutiny if she could.\\n\\n“I hate the captain!” she says again.\\n\\n“My dear Miss Denison!” I begin; for she has always been severe upon our\\nbluff old man, and it is not the spirit of contrariety alone which makes\\nme invariably take his part. Coarse he may be, and not one whom the\\nowners would have chosen to command the Lady Jermyn; a good seaman none\\nthe less, who brought us round the Horn in foul weather without losing\\nstitch or stick. I think of the ruddy ruffian in his dripping oilskins,\\non deck day and night for our sakes, and once more I must needs take his\\npart; but Miss Denison stops me before I can get out another word.\\n\\n“I am not dear, and I'm not yours,” she cries. “I'm only a\\nschool-girl--you have all but told me so before to-day! If I were a\\nman--if I were you--I should tell Captain Harris what I thought of him!”\\n\\n“Why? What has he done now?”\\n\\n“Now? You know how rude he was to poor Mr. Ready this very afternoon!”\\n\\nIt was true. He had been very rude indeed. But Ready also had been at\\nfault. It may be that I was always inclined to take an opposite view,\\nbut I felt bound to point this out, and at any cost.\\n\\n“You mean when Ready asked him if we were out of our course? I must\\nsay I thought it was a silly question to put. It was the same the other\\nevening about the cargo. If the skipper says we're in ballast why not\\nbelieve him? Why repeat steerage gossip, about mysterious cargoes, at\\nthe cuddy table? Captains are always touchy about that sort of thing. I\\nwasn't surprised at his letting out.”\\n\\nMy poor love stares at me in the starlight. Her great eyes flash their\\nscorn. Then she gives a little smile--and then a little nod--more\\nscornful than all the rest.\\n\\n“You never are surprised, are you, Mr. Cole?” says she. “You were not\\nsurprised when the wretch used horrible language in front of me! You\\nwere not surprised when it was a--dying man--whom he abused!”\\n\\nI try to soothe her. I agree heartily with her disgust at the epithets\\nemployed in her hearing, and towards an invalid, by the irate skipper.\\nBut I ask her to make allowances for a rough, uneducated man, rather\\nclumsily touched upon his tender spot. I shall conciliate her presently;\\nthe divine pout (so childish it was!) is fading from her lips; the\\nstarlight is on the tulle and lace and roses of her pretty evening\\ndress, with its festooned skirts and obsolete flounces; and I am\\nwatching her, ay, and worshipping her, though I do not know it yet. And\\nas we stand there comes another snatch from the forecastle:--\\n\\n       “What will you do, love, when I am going.\\n            With white sail flowing,\\n            The seas beyond?\\n        What will you do, love--”\\n\\n“They may make the most of that song,” says Miss Denison grimly; “it's\\nthe last they'll have from me. Get up as many more concerts as you like.\\nI won't sing at another unless it's in the fo'c'sle. I'll sing to the\\nmen, but not to Captain Harris. He didn't put in an appearance tonight.\\nHe shall not have another chance of insulting me.”\\n\\nWas it her vanity that was wounded after all? “You forget,” said I,\\n“that you would not answer when he addressed you at dinner.”\\n\\n“I should think I wouldn't, after the way he spoke to Mr. Ready; and he\\ntoo agitated to come to table, poor fellow!”\\n\\n“Still, the captain felt the open slight.”\\n\\n“Then he shouldn't have used such language in front of me.”\\n\\n“Your father felt it, too, Miss Denison.”\\n\\nI hear nothing plainer than her low but quick reply:\\n\\n“Mr. Cole, my father has been dead many; many years; he died before I\\ncan remember. That man only married my poor mother. He sympathizes\\nwith Captain Harris--against me; no father would do that. Look at them\\ntogether now! And you take his side, too; oh! I have no patience with\\nany of you--except poor Mr. Ready in his berth.”\\n\\n“But you are not going.”\\n\\n“Indeed I am. I am tired of you all.”\\n\\nAnd she was gone with angry tears for which I blamed myself as I fell to\\npacing the weather side of the poop--and so often afterwards! So often,\\nand with such unavailing bitterness!\\n\\nSenhor Santos and the captain were in conversation by the weather rail.\\nI fancied poor old Harris eyed me with suspicion, and I wished he had\\nbetter cause. The Portuguese, however, saluted me with his customary\\ncourtesy, and I thought there was a grave twinkle in his steady eye.\\n\\n“Are you in deesgrace also, friend Cole?” he inquired in his all but\\nperfect English.\\n\\n“More or less,” said I ruefully.\\n\\nHe gave the shrug of his country--that delicate gesture which is done\\nalmost entirely with the back--a subtlety beyond the power of British\\nshoulders.\\n\\n“The senhora is both weelful and pivish,” said he, mixing the two vowels\\nwhich (with the aspirate) were his only trouble with our tongue. “It is\\ngreat grif to me to see her growing so unlike her sainted mother!”\\n\\nHe sighed, and I saw his delicate fingers forsake the cigarette they\\nwere rolling to make the sacred sign upon his breast. He was always\\nsmoking one cigarette and making another; as he lit the new one the glow\\nfell upon a strange pin that he wore, a pin with a tiny crucifix inlaid\\nin mosaic. So the religious cast of Senhor Santos was brought twice home\\nto me in the same moment, though, to be sure, I had often been struck\\nby it before. And it depressed me to think that so sweet a child as Eva\\nDenison should have spoken harshly of so good a man as her step-father,\\nsimply because he had breadth enough to sympathize with a coarse old\\nsalt like Captain Harris.\\n\\nI turned in, however, and I cannot say the matter kept me awake in the\\nseparate state-room which was one luxury of our empty saloon. Alas? I\\nwas a heavy sleeper then.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. THE MYSTERIOUS CARGO\\n\\n\\n“Wake up, Cole! The ship's on fire!”\\n\\nIt was young Ready's hollow voice, as cool, however, as though he were\\ntelling me I was late for breakfast. I started up and sought him wildly\\nin the darkness.\\n\\n“You're joking,” was my first thought and utterance; for now he was\\nlighting my candle, and blowing out the match with a care that seemed in\\nitself a contradiction.\\n\\n“I wish I were,” he answered. “Listen to that!”\\n\\nHe pointed to my cabin ceiling; it quivered and creaked; and all at once\\nI was as a deaf man healed.\\n\\nOne gets inured to noise at sea, but to this day it passes me how even I\\ncould have slept an instant in the abnormal din which I now heard raging\\nabove my head. Sea-boots stamped; bare feet pattered; men bawled; women\\nshrieked; shouts of terror drowned the roar of command.\\n\\n“Have we long to last?” I asked, as I leaped for my clothes.\\n\\n“Long enough for you to dress comfortably. Steady, old man! It's only\\njust been discovered; they may get it under. The panic's the worst part\\nat present, and we're out of that.”\\n\\nBut was Eva Denison? Breathlessly I put the question; his answer was\\nreassuring. Miss Denison was with her step-father on the poop. “And both\\nof 'em as cool as cucumbers,” added Ready.\\n\\nThey could not have been cooler than this young man, with death at the\\nbottom of his bright and sunken eyes. He was of the type which is all\\nmuscle and no constitution; athletes one year, dead men the next; but\\nuntil this moment the athlete had been to me a mere and incredible\\ntradition. In the afternoon I had seen his lean knees totter under the\\ncaptain's fire. Now, at midnight--the exact time by my watch--it was as\\nif his shrunken limbs had expanded in his clothes; he seemed hardly to\\nknow his own flushed face, as he caught sight of it in my mirror.\\n\\n“By Jove!” said he, “this has put me in a fine old fever; but I don't\\nknow when I felt in better fettle. If only they get it under! I've not\\nlooked like this all the voyage.”\\n\\nAnd he admired himself while I dressed in hot haste: a fine young\\nfellow; not at all the natural egotist, but cast for death by the\\ndoctors, and keenly incredulous in his bag of skin. It revived one's\\nconfidence to hear him talk. But he forgot himself in an instant, and\\ngave me a lead through the saloon with a boyish eagerness that made me\\nactually suspicious as I ran. We were nearing the Line. I recalled the\\nexcesses of my last crossing, and I prepared for some vast hoax at the\\nlast moment. It was only when we plunged upon the crowded quarter-deck,\\nand my own eyes read lust of life and dread of death in the starting\\neyes of others, that such lust and such dread consumed me in my turn, so\\nthat my veins seemed filled with fire and ice.\\n\\nTo be fair to those others, I think that the first wild panic was\\nsubsiding even then; at least there was a lull, and even a reaction in\\nthe right direction on the part of the males in the second class and\\nsteerage. A huge Irishman at their head, they were passing buckets\\ntowards the after-hold; the press of people hid the hatchway from\\nus until we gained the poop; but we heard the buckets spitting and a\\nhose-pipe hissing into the flames below; and we saw the column of white\\nvapor rising steadily from their midst.\\n\\nAt the break of the poop stood Captain Harris, his legs planted wide\\napart, very vigorous, very decisive, very profane. And I must confess\\nthat the shocking oaths which had brought us round the Horn inspired a\\nkind of confidence in me now. Besides, even from the poop I could see\\nno flames. But the night was as beautiful as it had been an hour or two\\nback; the stars as brilliant, the breeze even more balmy, the sea even\\nmore calm; and we were hove-to already, against the worst.\\n\\nIn this hour of peril the poop was very properly invaded by all classes\\nof passengers, in all manner of incongruous apparel, in all stages of\\nfear, rage, grief and hysteria; as we made our way among this motley\\nnightmare throng, I took Ready by the arm.\\n\\n“The skipper's a brute,” said I, “but he's the right brute in the right\\nplace to-night, Ready!”\\n\\n“I hope he may be,” was the reply. “But we were off our course this\\nafternoon; and we were off it again during the concert, as sure as we're\\nnot on it now.”\\n\\nHis tone made me draw him to the rail.\\n\\n“But how do you know? You didn't have another look, did you?”\\n\\n“Lots of looks-at the stars. He couldn't keep me from consulting them;\\nand I'm just as certain of it as I'm certain that we've a cargo aboard\\nwhich we're none of us supposed to know anything about.”\\n\\nThe latter piece of gossip was, indeed, all over the ship; but this\\nallusion to it struck me as foolishly irrelevant and frivolous. As to\\nthe other matter, I suggested that the officers would have had more to\\nsay about it than Ready, if there had been anything in it.\\n\\n“Officers be damned!” cried our consumptive, with a sound man's vigor.\\n“They're ordinary seamen dressed up; I don't believe they've a second\\nmate's certificate between them, and they're frightened out of their\\nsouls.”\\n\\n“Well, anyhow, the skipper isn't that.”\\n\\n“No; he's drunk; he can shout straight, but you should hear him try to\\nspeak.”\\n\\nI made my way aft without rejoinder. “Invalid's pessimism,” was my\\nprivate comment. And yet the sick man was whole for the time being; the\\nvirile spirit was once more master of the recreant members; and it\\nwas with illogical relief that I found those I sought standing almost\\nunconcernedly beside the binnacle.\\n\\nMy little friend was, indeed, pale enough, and her eyes great with\\ndismay; but she stood splendidly calm, in her travelling cloak and\\nbonnet, and with all my soul I hailed the hardihood with which I had\\nrightly credited my love. Yes! I loved her then. It had come home to me\\nat last, and I no longer denied it in my heart. In my innocence and my\\njoy I rather blessed the fire for showing me her true self and my own;\\nand there I stood, loving her openly with my eyes (not to lose another\\ninstant), and bursting to tell her so with my lips.\\n\\nBut there also stood Senhor Santos, almost precisely as I had seen him\\nlast, cigarette, tie-pin, and all. He wore an overcoat, however, and\\nleaned upon a massive ebony cane, while he carried his daughter's guitar\\nin its case, exactly as though they were waiting for a train. Moreover,\\nI thought that for the first time he was regarding me with no very\\nfavoring glance.\\n\\n“You don't think it serious?” I asked him abruptly, my heart still\\nbounding with the most incongruous joy.\\n\\nHe gave me his ambiguous shrug; and then, “A fire at sea is surely\\nsirrious,” said he.\\n\\n“Where did it break out?”\\n\\n“No one knows; it may have come of your concert.”\\n\\n“But they are getting the better of it?”\\n\\n“They are working wonders so far, senhor.”\\n\\n“You see, Miss Denison,” I continued ecstatically, “our rough old\\ndiamond of a skipper is the right man in the right place after all. A\\ntight man in a tight place, eh?” and I laughed like an idiot in their\\ncalm grave faces.\\n\\n“Senhor Cole is right,” said Santos, “although his 'ilarity sims a\\nleetle out of place. But you must never spik against Captain 'Arrees\\nagain, menma.”\\n\\n“I never will,” the poor child said; yet I saw her wince whenever the\\ncaptain raised that hoarse voice of his in more and more blasphemous\\nexhortation; and I began to fear with Ready that the man was drunk.\\n\\nMy eyes were still upon my darling, devouring her, revelling in her,\\nwhen suddenly I saw her hand twitch within her step-father's arm. It was\\nan answering start to one on his part. The cigarette was snatched from\\nhis lips. There was a commotion forward, and a cry came aft, from mouth\\nto mouth:\\n\\n“The flames! The flames!”\\n\\nI turned, and caught their reflection on the white column of smoke and\\nsteam. I ran forward, and saw them curling and leaping in the hell-mouth\\nof the hold.\\n\\nThe quarter-deck now staged a lurid scene: that blazing trap-door in\\nits midst; and each man there a naked demon madly working to save his\\nroasting skin. Abaft the mainmast the deck-pump was being ceaselessly\\nworked by relays of the passengers; dry blankets were passed forward,\\nsoaking blankets were passed aft, and flung flat into the furnace one\\nafter another. These did more good than the pure water: the pillar of\\nsmoke became blacker, denser: we were at a crisis; a sudden hush denoted\\nit; even our hoarse skipper stood dumb.\\n\\nI had rushed down into the waist of the ship--blushing for my delay--and\\nalready I was tossing blankets with the rest. Looking up in an enforced\\npause, I saw Santos whispering in the skipper's ear, with the expression\\nof a sphinx but no lack of foreign gesticulation--behind them a fringe\\nof terror-stricken faces, parted at that instant by two more figures,\\nas wild and strange as any in that wild, strange scene. One was our\\nluckless lucky digger, the other a gigantic Zambesi nigger, who for\\ndays had been told off to watch him; this was the servant (or rather the\\nslave) of Senhor Santos.\\n\\nThe digger planted himself before the captain. His face was reddened by\\na fire as consuming as that within the bowels of our gallant ship. He\\nhad a huge, unwieldy bundle under either arm.\\n\\n“Plain question--plain answer,” we heard him stutter. “Is there any ----\\nchance of saving this ---- ship?”\\n\\nHis adjectives were too foul for print; they were given with such a\\nspecial effort at distinctness, however, that I was smiling one instant,\\nand giving thanks the next that Eva Denison had not come forward with\\nher guardian. Meanwhile the skipper had exchanged a glance with Senhor\\nSantos, and I think we all felt that he was going to tell us the truth.\\n\\nHe told it in two words--“Very little.”\\n\\nThen the first individual tragedy was enacted before every eye. With\\na yell the drunken maniac rushed to the rail. The nigger was at his\\nheels--he was too late. Uttering another and more piercing shriek, the\\nmadman was overboard at a bound; one of his bundles preceded him; the\\nother dropped like a cannon-ball on the deck.\\n\\nThe nigger caught it up and carried it forward to the captain.\\n\\nHarris held up his hand. We were still before we had fairly found our\\ntongues. His words did run together a little, but he was not drunk.\\n\\n“Men and women,” said he, “what I told that poor devil is Gospel truth;\\nbut I didn't tell him we'd no chance of saving our lives, did I? Not\\nme, because we have! Keep your heads and listen to me. There's two\\ngood boats on the davits amidships; the chief will take one, the second\\nofficer the other; and there ain't no reason why every blessed one of\\nyou shouldn't sleep in Ascension to-morrow night. As for me, let me see\\nevery soul off of my ship and perhaps I may follow; but by the God that\\nmade you, look alive! Mr. Arnott--Mr. McClellan--man them boats and\\nlower away. You can't get quit o' the ship too soon, an' I don't mind\\ntellin' you why. I'll tell you the worst, an' then you'll know. There's\\nbeen a lot o' gossip goin', gossip about my cargo. I give out as I'd\\nnone but ship's stores and ballast, an' I give out a lie. I don't mind\\ntellin' you now. I give out a cussed lie, but I give it out for the\\ngood o' the ship! What was the use o' frightenin' folks? But where's the\\nsense in keepin' it back now? We have a bit of a cargo,” shouted Harris;\\n“and it's gunpowder--every damned ton of it!”\\n\\nThe effect of this announcement may be imagined; my hand has not the\\ncunning to reproduce it on paper; and if it had, it would shrink from\\nthe task. Mild men became brutes, brutal men, devils, women--God help\\nthem!--shrieking beldams for the most part. Never shall I forget them\\nwith their streaming hair, their screaming open mouths, and the cruel\\nascending fire glinting on their starting eyeballs!\\n\\nPell-mell they tumbled down the poop-ladders; pell-mell they raced\\namidships past that yawning open furnace; the pitch was boiling through\\nthe seams of the crackling deck; they slipped and fell upon it, one over\\nanother, and the wonder is that none plunged headlong into the flames.\\nA handful remained on the poop, cowering and undone with terror. Upon\\nthese turned Captain Harris, as Ready and I, stemming the torrent of\\nmaddened humanity, regained the poop ourselves.\\n\\n“For'ard with ye!” yelled the skipper. “The powder's underneath you in\\nthe lazarette!”\\n\\nThey were gone like hunted sheep. And now abaft the flaming hatchway\\nthere were only we four surviving saloon passengers, the captain, his\\nsteward, the Zambesi negro, and the quarter-master at the wheel. The\\nsteward and the black I observed putting stores aboard the captain's gig\\nas it overhung the water from the stern davits.\\n\\n“Now, gentlemen,” said Harris to the two of us, “I must trouble you to\\nstep forward with the rest. Senhor Santos insists on taking his chance\\nalong with the young lady in my gig. I've told him the risk, but he\\ninsists, and the gig'll hold no more.”\\n\\n“But she must have a crew, and I can row. For God's sake take me,\\ncaptain!” cried I; for Eva Denison sat weeping in her deck chair, and my\\nheart bled faint at the thought of leaving her, I who loved her so, and\\nmight die without ever telling her my love! Harris, however, stood firm.\\n\\n“There's that quartermaster and my steward, and Jose the nigger,” said\\nhe. “That's quite enough, Mr. Cole, for I ain't above an oar myself;\\nbut, by God, I'm skipper o' this here ship, and I'll skip her as long as\\nI remain aboard!”\\n\\nI saw his hand go to his belt; I saw the pistols stuck there for\\nmutineers. I looked at Santos. He answered me with his neutral shrug,\\nand, by my soul, he struck a match and lit a cigarette in that hour of\\nlife and death! Then last I looked at Ready; and he leant invertebrate\\nover the rail, gasping pitiably from his exertions in regaining the\\npoop, a dying man once more. I pointed out his piteous state.\\n\\n“At least,” I whispered, “you won't refuse to take him?”\\n\\n“Will there be anything to take?” said the captain brutally.\\n\\nSantos advanced leisurely, and puffed his cigarette over the poor wasted\\nand exhausted frame.\\n\\n“It is for you to decide, captain,” said he cynically; “but this one\\nwill make no deeference. Yes, I would take him. It will not be far,” he\\nadded, in a tone that was not the less detestable for being lowered.\\n\\n“Take them both!” moaned little Eva, putting in her first and last sweet\\nword.\\n\\n“Then we all drown, Evasinha,” said her stepfather. “It is impossible.”\\n\\n“We're too many for her as it is,” said the captain. “So for'ard with\\nye, Mr. Cole, before it's too late.”\\n\\nBut my darling's brave word for me had fired my blood, and I turned\\nwith equal resolution on Harris and on the Portuguese. “I will go like\\na lamb,” said I, “if you will first give me five minutes' conversation\\nwith Miss Denison. Otherwise I do not go; and as for the gig, you may\\ntake me or leave me, as you choose.”\\n\\n“What have you to say to her?” asked Santos, coming up to me, and again\\nlowering his voice.\\n\\nI lowered mine still more. “That I love her!” I answered in a soft\\necstasy. “That she may remember how I loved her, if I die!”\\n\\nHis shoulders shrugged a cynical acquiescence.\\n\\n“By all mins, senhor; there is no harm in that.”\\n\\nI was at her side before another word could pass his withered lips.\\n\\n“Miss Denison, will you grant me five minutes', conversation? It may be\\nthe last that we shall ever have together!”\\n\\nUncovering her face, she looked at me with a strange terror in her great\\neyes; then with a questioning light that was yet more strange, for in it\\nthere was a wistfulness I could not comprehend. She suffered me to take\\nher hand, however, and to lead her unresisting to the weather rail.\\n\\n“What is it you have to say?” she asked me in her turn. “What is it that\\nyou--think?”\\n\\nHer voice fell as though she must have the truth.\\n\\n“That we have all a very good chance,” said I heartily.\\n\\n“Is that all?” cried Eva, and my heart sank at her eager manner.\\n\\nShe seemed at once disappointed and relieved. Could it be possible she\\ndreaded a declaration which she had foreseen all along? My evil first\\nexperience rose up to warn me. No, I would not speak now; it was no\\ntime. If she loved me, it might make her love me less; better to trust\\nto God to spare us both.\\n\\n“Yes, it is all,” I said doggedly.\\n\\nShe drew a little nearer, hesitating. It was as though her\\ndisappointment had gained on her relief.\\n\\n“Do you know what I thought you were going to say?”\\n\\n“No, indeed.”\\n\\n“Dare I tell you?”\\n\\n“You can trust me.”\\n\\nHer pale lips parted. Her great eyes shone. Another instant, and she had\\ntold me that which I would have given all but life itself to know. But\\nin that tick of time a quick step came behind me, and the light went out\\nof the sweet face upturned to mine.\\n\\n“I cannot! I must not! Here is--that man!”\\n\\nSenhor Santos was all smiles and rings of pale-blue smoke.\\n\\n“You will be cut off, friend Cole,” said he. “The fire is spreading.”\\n\\n“Let it spread!” I cried, gazing my very soul into the young girl's\\neyes. “We have not finished our conversation.\\n\\n“We have!” said she, with sudden decision. “Go--go--for my sake--for\\nyour own sake--go at once!”\\n\\nShe gave me her hand. I merely clasped it. And so I left her at the\\nrail-ah, heaven! how often we had argued on that very spot! So I left\\nher, with the greatest effort of all my life (but one); and yet in\\npassing, full as my heart was of love and self, I could not but lay a\\nhand on poor Ready's shoulders.\\n\\n“God bless you, old boy!” I said to him.\\n\\nHe turned a white face that gave me half an instant's pause.\\n\\n“It's all over with me this time,” he said. “But, I say, I was right\\nabout the cargo?”\\n\\nAnd I heard a chuckle as I reached the ladder; but Ready was no longer\\nin my mind; even Eva was driven out of it, as I stood aghast on the\\ntop-most rung.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. TO THE WATER'S EDGE\\n\\n\\nIt was not the new panic amidships that froze my marrow; it was not that\\nthe pinnace hung perpendicularly by the fore-tackle, and had shot out\\nthose who had swarmed aboard her before she was lowered, as a cart\\nshoots a load of bricks. It was bad enough to see the whole boat-load\\nstruggling, floundering, sinking in the sea; for selfish eyes (and which\\nof us is all unselfish at such a time?) there was a worse sight yet; for\\nI saw all this across an impassable gulf of fire.\\n\\nThe quarter-deck had caught: it was in flames to port and starboard of\\nthe flaming hatch; only fore and aft of it was the deck sound to the\\nlips of that hideous mouth, with the hundred tongues shooting out and\\nup.\\n\\nCould I jump it there? I sprang down and looked. It was only a few feet\\nacross; but to leap through that living fire was to leap into eternity.\\nI drew back instantly, less because my heart failed me, I may truly say,\\nthan because my common sense did not.\\n\\nSome were watching me, it seemed, across this hell. “The bulwarks!” they\\nscreamed. “Walk along the bulwarks!” I held up my hand in token that\\nI heard and understood and meant to act. And as I did their bidding I\\nnoticed what indeed had long been apparent to idler eyes: the wind was\\nnot; we had lost our southeast trades; the doomed ship was rolling in a\\ndead calm.\\n\\nRolling, rolling, rolling so that it seemed minutes before I dared to\\nmove an inch. Then I tried it on my hands and knees, but the scorched\\nbulwarks burned me to the bone. And then I leapt up, desperate with the\\npain; and, with my tortured hands spread wide to balance me, I walked\\nthose few yards, between rising sea and falling fire, and falling sea\\nand rising fire, as an acrobat walks a rope, and by God's grace without\\nmishap.\\n\\nThere was no time to think twice about my feat, or, indeed, about\\nanything else that befell upon a night when each moment was more\\npregnant than the last. And yet I did think that those who had\\nencouraged me to attempt so perilous a trick might have welcomed me\\nalive among them; they were looking at something else already; and this\\nwas what it was.\\n\\nOne of the cabin stewards had presented himself on the poop; he had a\\nbottle in one hand, a glass in the other; in the red glare we saw\\nhim dancing in front of the captain like an unruly marionette. Harris\\nappeared to threaten him. What he said we could not hear for the\\ndeep-drawn blast and the high staccato crackle of the blazing hold. But\\nwe saw the staggering steward offering him a drink; saw the glass flung\\nnext instant in the captain's face, the blood running, a pistol drawn,\\nfired without effect, and snatched away by the drunken mutineer. Next\\ninstant a smooth black cane was raining blow after blow on the man's\\nhead. He dropped; the blows fell thick and heavy as before. He lay\\nwriggling; the Portuguese struck and struck until he lay quite still;\\nthen we saw Joaquin Santos kneel, and rub his stick carefully on the\\nstill thing's clothes, as a man might wipe his boots.\\n\\nCurses burst from our throats; yet the fellow deserved to die. Nor, as I\\nsay, had we time to waste two thoughts upon any one incident. This\\nlast had begun and ended in the same minute; in another we were at the\\nstarboard gangway, tumbling helter-skelter aboard the lowered long-boat.\\n\\nShe lay safely on the water: how we thanked our gods for that! Lower and\\nlower sank her gunwale as we dropped aboard her, with no more care than\\nthe Gadarene swine whose fate we courted. Discipline, order, method,\\ncommon care, we brought none of these things with us from our floating\\nfurnace; but we fought to be first over the bulwarks, and in the bottom\\nof the long-boat we fought again.\\n\\nAnd yet she held us all! All, that is, but a terror-stricken few, who\\nlay along the jibboom like flies upon a stick: all but two or three more\\nwhom we left fatally hesitating in the forechains: all but the selfish\\nsavages who had been the first to perish in the pinnace, and one\\ndistracted couple who had thrown their children into the kindly ocean,\\nand jumped in after them out of their torment, locked for ever in each\\nother's arms.\\n\\nYes! I saw more things on that starry night, by that blood-red glare,\\nthan I have told you in their order, and more things than I shall tell\\nyou now. Blind would I gladly be for my few remaining years, if that\\nnight's horrors could be washed from these eyes for ever. I have said so\\nmuch, however, that in common candor I must say one thing more. I have\\nspoken of selfish savages. God help me and forgive me! For by this time\\nI was one myself.\\n\\nIn the long-boat we cannot have been less than thirty; the exact number\\nno man will ever know. But we shoved off without mischance; the chief\\nmate had the tiller; the third mate the boat-hook; and six or eight\\noars were at work, in a fashion, as we plunged among the great smooth\\nsickening mounds and valleys of fathomless ink.\\n\\nScarcely were we clear when the foremast dropped down on the fastenings,\\ndashing the jib-boom into the water with its load of demented human\\nbeings. The mainmast followed by the board before we had doubled our\\ndistance from the wreck. Both trailed to port, where we could not see\\nthem; and now the mizzen stood alone in sad and solitary grandeur, her\\nflapping idle sails lighted up by the spreading conflagration, so that\\nthey were stamped very sharply upon the black add starry sky. But the\\nwhole scene from the long-boat was one of startling brilliancy and\\nhorror. The fire now filled the entire waist of the vessel, and the\\nnoise of it was as the rumble and roar of a volcano. As for the light,\\nI declare that it put many a star clean out, and dimmed the radiance\\nof all the rest, as it flooded the sea for miles around, and a sea of\\nmolten glass reflected it. My gorge rose at the long, low billows-sleek\\nas black satin--lifting and dipping in this ghastly glare. I preferred\\nto keep my eyes upon the little ship burning like a tar barrel as the\\npicture grew. But presently I thanked God aloud: there was the gig\\nswimming like a beetle over the bloodshot rollers in our wake.\\n\\nIn our unspeakable gladness at being quit of the ship, some minutes\\npassed before we discovered that the long-boat was slowly filling. The\\nwater was at our ankles before a man of us cried out, so fast were our\\neyes to the poor lost Lady Jermyn. Then all at once the ghastly fact\\ndawned upon us; and I think it was the mate himself who burst out crying\\nlike a child. I never ascertained, however, for I had kicked off my\\nshoes and was busy baling with them. Others were hunting for the leak.\\nBut the mischief was as subtle as it was mortal--as though a plank\\nhad started from end to end. Within and without the waters rose\\nequally--then lay an instant level with our gunwales--then swamped us,\\noh! so slowly, that I thought we were never going to sink. It was\\nlike getting inch by inch into your tub; I can feel it now, creeping,\\ncrawling up my back. “It's coming! O Christ!” muttered one as it came;\\nto me it was a downright relief to be carried under at last.\\n\\nBut then, thank God, I have always been a strong swimmer. The water was\\nwarm and buoyant, and I came up like a cork, as I knew I should. I shook\\nthe drops from my face, and there were the sweet stars once more; for\\nmany an eye they had gone Out for ever; and there the burning wreck.\\n\\nA man floundered near me, in a splutter of phosphorescence. I tried to\\nhelp him, and in an instant he had me wildly round the neck. In the end\\nI shook him off, poor devil, to his death. And he was the last I tried\\nto aid: have I not said already what I was become?\\n\\nIn a little an oar floated my way: I threw my arms across it and gripped\\nit with my chin as I swam. It relieved me greatly. Up and down I rode\\namong the oily black hillocks; I was down when there was a sudden flare\\nas though the sun had risen, and I saw still a few heads bobbing and a\\nfew arms waving frantically around me. At the same instant a terrific\\ndetonation split the ears; and when I rose on the next bald billow,\\nwhere the ship lay burning a few seconds before, there remained but a\\nred-hot spine that hissed and dwindled for another minute, and then left\\na blackness through which every star shone with redoubled brilliance.\\n\\nAnd now right and left splashed falling missiles; a new source of danger\\nor of temporary respite; to me, by a merciful Providence, it proved the\\nlatter.\\n\\nSome heavy thing fell with a mighty splash right in front of me. A few\\nmore yards, and my brains had floated with the spume. As it was, the\\noar was dashed from under my armpits; in another moment they had found a\\nmore solid resting-place.\\n\\nIt was a hen-coop, and it floated bars upwards like a boat. In this\\ncalm it might float for days. I climbed upon the bars-and the whole cage\\nrolled over on top of me.\\n\\nComing to the surface, I found to my joy that the hen-coop had righted\\nitself; so now I climbed up again, but this time very slowly and\\ngingerly; the balance was undisturbed, and I stretched myself cautiously\\nalong the bars on my stomach. A good idea immediately occurred to me. I\\nhad jumped as a matter of course into the flannels which one naturally\\nwears in the tropics. To their lightness I already owed my life, but the\\ncommon cricket-belt which was part of the costume was the thing to which\\nI owe it most of all. Loosening this belt a little, as I tucked my toes\\ntenaciously under the endmost bar, I undid and passed the two ends under\\none of the middle bars, fastening the clasp upon the other side. If I\\ncapsized now, well, we might go to the bottom together; otherwise the\\nhen-coop and I should not part company in a hurry; and I thought, I\\nfelt, that she would float.\\n\\nWorn out as I was, and comparatively secure for the moment, I will not\\nsay that I slept; but my eyes closed, and every fibre rested, as I rose\\nand slid with the smooth, long swell. Whether I did indeed hear voices,\\ncurses, cries, I cannot say positively to this day. I only know that I\\nraised my head and looked sharply all ways but the way I durst not look\\nfor fear of an upset. And, again, I thought I saw first a tiny flame,\\nand then a tinier glow; and as my head drooped, and my eyes closed\\nagain, I say I thought I smelt tobacco; but this, of course, was my\\nimagination supplying all the links from one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. THE SILENT SEA\\n\\n\\nRemember (if indeed there be any need to remind you) that it is a\\nflagrant landsman who is telling you this tale. Nothing know I of\\nseamanship, save what one could not avoid picking up on the round voyage\\nof the Lady Jermyn, never to be completed on this globe. I may be told\\nthat I have burned that devoted vessel as nothing ever burned on land or\\nsea. I answer that I write of what I saw, and that is not altered by a\\nmiscalled spar or a misunderstood manouvre. But now I am aboard a craft\\nI handle for myself, and must make shift to handle a second time with\\nthis frail pen.\\n\\nThe hen-coop was some six feet long, by eighteen or twenty inches in\\nbreadth and depth. It was simply a long box with bars in lieu of a lid;\\nbut it was very strongly built.\\n\\nI recognized it as one of two which had stood lashed against either rail\\nof the Lady Jermyn's poop; there the bars had risen at right angles to\\nthe deck; now they lay horizontal, a gridiron six feet long-and my bed.\\nAnd as each particular bar left its own stripe across my wearied body,\\nand yet its own comfort in my quivering heart, another day broke over\\nthe face of the waters, and over me.\\n\\nDiscipline, what there was of it originally, had been the very first\\nthing to perish aboard our ill-starred ship; the officers, I am afraid,\\nwere not much better than poor Ready made them out (thanks to Bendigo\\nand Ballarat), and little had been done in true ship-shape style all\\nnight. All hands had taken their spell at everything as the fancy seized\\nthem; not a bell had been struck from first to last; and I can only\\nconjecture that the fire raged four or five hours, from the fact that\\nit was midnight by my watch when I left it on my cabin drawers, and that\\nthe final extinction of the smouldering keel was so soon followed by the\\nfirst deep hint of dawn. The rest took place with the trite rapidity of\\nthe equatorial latitudes. It had been my foolish way to pooh-pooh the\\nold saying that there is no twilight in the tropics. I saw more truth in\\nit as I lay lonely on this heaving waste.\\n\\nThe stars were out; the sea was silver; the sun was up.\\n\\nAnd oh! the awful glory of that sunrise! It was terrific; it was\\nsickening; my senses swam. Sunlit billows smooth and sinister, without a\\ncrest, without a sound; miles and miles of them as I rose; an oily grave\\namong them as I fell. Hill after hill of horror, valley after valley of\\ndespair! The face of the waters in petty but eternal unrest; and now\\nthe sun must shine to set it smiling, to show me its cruel ceaseless\\nmouthings, to reveal all but the ghastlier horrors underneath.\\n\\nHow deep was it? I fell to wondering! Not that it makes any difference\\nwhether you drown in one fathom or in ten thousand, whether you fall\\nfrom a balloon or from the attic window. But the greater depth or\\ndistance is the worse to contemplate; and I was as a man hanging by his\\nhands so high above the world, that his dangling feet cover countries,\\ncontinents; a man who must fall very soon, and wonders how long he will\\nbe falling, falling; and how far his soul will bear his body company.\\n\\nIn time I became more accustomed to the sun upon this heaving void; less\\nfrightened, as a child is frightened, by the mere picture. And I have\\nstill the impression that, as hour followed hour since the falling of\\nthe wind, the nauseous swell in part subsided. I seemed less often on\\nan eminence or in a pit; my glassy azure dales had gentler slopes, or a\\ndistemper was melting from my eyes.\\n\\nAt least I know that I had now less work to keep my frail ship trim,\\nthough this also may have come by use and practice. In the beginning one\\nor other of my legs had been for ever trailing in the sea, to keep the\\nhen-coop from rolling over the other way; in fact, as I understand they\\nsteer the toboggan in Canada, so I my little bark. Now the necessity for\\nthis was gradually decreasing; whatever the cause, it was the greatest\\nmercy the day had brought me yet. With less strain on the attention,\\nhowever, there was more upon the mind. No longer forced to exert some\\nmuscle twice or thrice a minute, I had time to feel very faint, and yet\\ntime to think. My soul flew homing to its proper prison. I was no longer\\nany unit at unequal strife with the elements; instincts common to my\\nkind were no longer my only stimulus. I was my poor self again; it was\\nmy own little life, and no other, that I wanted to go on living; and\\nyet I felt vaguely there was some special thing I wished to live for,\\nsomething that had not been very long in my ken; something that had\\nperhaps nerved and strengthened me all these hours. What, then, could it\\nbe? I could not think.\\n\\nFor moments or for minutes I wondered stupidly, dazed as I was. Then\\nI remembered--and the tears gushed to my eyes. How could I ever have\\nforgotten? I deserved it all, all, all! To think that many a time we\\nmust have sat together on this very coop! I kissed its blistering edge\\nat the thought, and my tears ran afresh, as though they never would\\nstop.\\n\\nAh! how I thought of her as that cruel day's most cruel sun climbed\\nhigher and higher in the flawless flaming vault. A pocket-handkerchief\\nof all things had remained in my trousers pocket through fire and water;\\nI knotted it on the old childish plan, and kept it ever drenched upon\\nthe head that had its own fever to endure as well. Eva Denison! Eva\\nDenison! I was talking to her in the past, I was talking to her in the\\nfuture, and oh! how different were the words, the tone! Yes, I hated\\nmyself for having forgotten her; but I hated God for having given her\\nback to my tortured brain; it made life so many thousandfold more sweet,\\nand death so many thousandfold more bitter.\\n\\nShe was saved in the gig. Sweet Jesus, thanks for that! But I--I was\\ndying a lingering death in mid-ocean; she would never know how I loved\\nher, I, who could only lecture her when I had her at my side.\\n\\nDying? No--no--not yet! I must live--live--live--to tell my darling how\\nI had loved her all the time. So I forced myself from my lethargy of\\ndespair and grief; and this thought, the sweetest thought of all my\\nlife, may or may not have been my unrealized stimulus ere now; it was in\\nvery deed my most conscious and perpetual spur henceforth until the end.\\n\\nFrom this onward, while my sense stood by me, I was practical,\\nresourceful, alert. It was now high-noon, and I had eaten nothing since\\ndinner the night before. How clearly I saw the long saloon table, only\\nlaid, however, abaft the mast; the glittering glass, the cool white\\nnapery, the poor old dried dessert in the green dishes! Earlier, this\\nhad occupied my mind an hour; now I dismissed it in a moment; there was\\nEva, I must live for her; there must be ways of living at least a day or\\ntwo without sustenance, and I must think of them.\\n\\nSo I undid that belt of mine which fastened me to my gridiron, and I\\nstraddled my craft with a sudden keen eye for sharks, of which I never\\nonce had thought until now. Then I tightened the belt about my hollow\\nbody, and just sat there with the problem. The past hour I had been\\nwholly unobservant; the inner eye had had its turn; but that was over\\nnow, and I sat as upright as possible, seeking greedily for a sail. Of\\ncourse I saw none. Had we indeed been off our course before the fire\\nbroke out? Had we burned to cinders aside and apart from the regular\\ntrack of ships? Then, though my present valiant mood might ignore\\nthe adverse chances, they were as one hundred to a single chance of\\ndeliverance. Our burning had brought no ship to our succor; and how\\nshould I, a mere speck amid the waves, bring one to mine?\\n\\nMoreover, I was all but motionless; I was barely drifting at all. This\\nI saw from a few objects which were floating around me now at noon; they\\nhad been with me when the high sun rose. One was, I think, the very\\noar which had been my first support; another was a sailor's cap; but\\nanother, which floated nearer, was new to me, as though it had come to\\nthe surface while my eyes were turned inwards. And this was clearly the\\ncase; for the thing was a drowned and bloated corpse.\\n\\nIt fascinated me, though not with extraordinary horror; it came too late\\nto do that. I thought I recognized the man's back. I fancied it was\\nthe mate who had taken charge of the long-boat. Was I then the single\\nsurvivor of those thirty souls? I was still watching my poor lost\\ncomrade, when that happened to him against which even I was not proof.\\nThrough the deep translucent blue beneath me a slim shape glided; three\\nsmaller fish led the way; they dallied an instant a fathom under my\\nfeet, which were snatched up, with what haste you may imagine; then on\\nthey went to surer prey.\\n\\nHe turned over; his dreadful face stared upwards; it was the chief\\nofficer, sure enough. Then he clove the water with a rush, his dead hand\\nwaved, the last of him to disappear; and I had a new horror to think\\nover for my sins. His poor fingers were all broken and beaten to a pulp.\\n\\nThe voices of the night came back to me--the curses and the cries. Yes,\\nI must have heard them. In memory now I recognized the voice of the\\nchief mate, but there again came in the assisted imagination. Yet I\\nwas not so sure of this as before. I thought of Santos and his horrible\\nheavy cane. Good God! she was in the power of that! I must live for Eva\\nindeed; must save myself to save and protect my innocent and helpless\\ngirl.\\n\\nAgain I was a man; stronger than ever was the stimulus now, louder than\\never the call on every drop of true man's blood in my perishing frame.\\nIt should not perish! It should not!\\n\\nYet my throat was parched; my lips were caked; my frame was hollow. Very\\nweak I was already; without sustenance I should surely die. But as yet\\nI was far enough from death, or I had done disdaining the means of life\\nthat all this time lay ready to my hand. A number of dead fowls imparted\\nballast to my little craft.\\n\\nYet I could not look at them in all these hours; or I could look, but\\nthat was all. So I must sit up one hour more, and keep a sharper eye\\nthan ever for the tiniest glimmer of a sail. To what end, I often asked\\nmyself? I might see them; they would never see me.\\n\\nThen my eyes would fail, and “you squeamish fool!” I said at intervals,\\nuntil my tongue failed to articulate; it had swollen so in my mouth.\\nFlying fish skimmed the water like thick spray; petrels were so few that\\nI could count them; another shark swam round me for an hour. In sudden\\npanic I dashed my knuckles on the wooden bars, to get at a duck to give\\nthe monster for a sop. My knuckles bled. I held them to my mouth. My\\ncleaving tongue wanted more. The duck went to the shark; a few minutes\\nmore and I had made my own vile meal as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. MY REWARD\\n\\n\\nThe sun declined; my shadow broadened on die waters; and now I felt that\\nif my cockle-shell could live a little longer, why, so could I.\\n\\nI had got at the fowls without further hurt. Some of the bars took out,\\nI discovered how. And now very carefully I got my legs in, and knelt;\\nbut the change of posture was not worth the risk one ran for it; there\\nwas too much danger of capsizing, and failing to free oneself before she\\nfilled and sank.\\n\\nWith much caution I began breaking the bars, one by one; it was hard\\nenough, weak as I was; my thighs were of more service than my hands.\\n\\nBut at last I could sit, the grating only covering me from the knees\\ndownwards. And the relief of that outweighed all the danger, which, as I\\ndiscovered to my untold joy, was now much less than it had been before.\\nI was better ballast than the fowls.\\n\\nThese I had attached to the lashings which had been blown asunder by the\\nexplosion; at one end of the coop the ring-bolt had been torn clean out,\\nbut at the other it was the cordage that had parted. To the frayed\\nends I tied my fowls by the legs, with the most foolish pride in my own\\ncunning. Do you not see? It would keep them fresh for my use, and it was\\na trick I had read of in no book; it was all my own.\\n\\nSo evening fell and found me hopeful and even puffed up; but yet, no\\nsail.\\n\\nNow, however, I could lie back, and use had given me a strange sense of\\nsafety; besides, I think I knew, I hope I felt, that the hen-coop was in\\nother Hands than mine.\\n\\nAll is reaction in the heart of man; light follows darkness nowhere more\\nsurely than in that hidden self, and now at sunset it was my heart's\\nhigh-noon. Deep peace pervaded me as I lay outstretched in my narrow\\nrocking bed, as it might be in my coffin; a trust in my Maker's will\\nto save me if that were for the best, a trust in His final wisdom and\\nloving-kindness, even though this night should be my last on earth. For\\nmyself I was resigned, and for others I must trust Him no less. Who was\\nI to constitute myself the protector of the helpless, when He was in\\nHis Heaven? Such was my sunset mood; it lasted a few minutes, and then,\\nwithout radically changing, it became more objective.\\n\\nThe west was a broadening blaze of yellow and purple and red. I cannot\\ndescribe it to you. If you have seen the sun set in the tropics, you\\nwould despise my description; and, if not, I for one could never make\\nyou see it. Suffice it that a petrel wheeled somewhere between deepening\\ncarmine and paling blue, and it took my thoughts off at an earthy\\ntangent. I thanked God there were no big sea-birds in these latitudes;\\nno molly-hawks, no albatrosses, no Cape-hens. I thought of an albatross\\nthat I had caught going out. Its beak and talons were at the bottom\\nwith the charred remains of the Lady Jermyn. But I could see them\\nstill, could feel them shrewdly in my mind's flesh; and so to the old\\nsuperstition, strangely justified by my case; and so to the poem which\\nI, with my special experience, not unnaturally consider the greatest\\npoem ever penned.\\n\\nBut I did not know it then as I do now--and how the lines eluded me! I\\nseemed to see them in the book, yet I could not read the words!\\n\\n             “Water, water, everywhere,\\n              Nor any drop to drink.”\\n\\nThat, of course, came first (incorrectly); and it reminded me of my\\nthirst, which the blood of the fowls had so very partially appeased. I\\nsee now that it is lucky I could recall but little more. Experience is\\nless terrible than realization, and that poem makes me realize what I\\nwent through as memory cannot. It has verses which would have driven me\\nmad. On the other hand, the exhaustive mental search for them distracted\\nmy thoughts until the stars were back in the sky; and now I had a new\\noccupation, saying to myself all the poetry I could remember, especially\\nthat of the sea; for I was a bookish fellow even then. But I never\\nwas anything of a scholar. It is odd therefore, that the one apposite\\npassage which recurred to me in its entirety was in hexameters and\\npentameters:\\n\\n   Me miserum, quanti montes volvuntur aquarum!\\n   Jam jam tacturos sidera summa putes.\\n   Quantae diducto subsidunt aequore valles!\\n   Jam jam tacturas Tartara nigra putes.\\n   Quocunque adspicio, nihil est nisi pontus et aether;\\n   Fluctibus hic tumidis, nubibus ille minax....\\n\\nMore there was of it in my head; but this much was an accurate statement\\nof my case; and yet less so now (I was thankful to reflect) than in\\nthe morning, when every wave was indeed a mountain, and its trough a\\nTartarus. I had learnt the lines at school; nay, they had formed my very\\nearliest piece of Latin repetition. And how sharply I saw the room I\\nsaid them in, the man I said them to, ever since my friend! I figured\\nhim even now hearing Ovid rep., the same passage in the same room. And I\\nlay saying it on a hen-coop in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!\\n\\nAt last I fell into a deep sleep, a long unconscious holiday of the\\nsoul, undefiled by any dream.\\n\\nThey say that our dreaming is done as we slowly wake; then was I out of\\nthe way of it that night, for a sudden violent rocking awoke me in\\none horrid instant. I made it worse by the way I started to a sitting\\nposture. I had shipped some water. I was shipping more. Yet all around\\nthe sea was glassy; whence then the commotion? As my ship came trim\\nagain, and I saw that my hour was not yet, the cause occurred to me; and\\nmy heart turned so sick that it was minutes before I had the courage to\\ntest my theory.\\n\\nIt was the true one.\\n\\nA shark had been at my trailing fowls; had taken the bunch of them\\ntogether, dragging the legs from my loose fastenings. Lucky they had\\nbeen no stronger! Else had I been dragged down to perdition too.\\n\\nLucky, did I say? The refinement of cruelty rather; for now I had\\nneither meat nor drink; my throat was a kiln; my tongue a flame; and\\nanother day at hand.\\n\\nThe stars were out; the sea was silver; the sun was up!\\n\\n         .        .         .         .         .\\n\\nHours passed.\\n\\nI was waiting now for my delirium.\\n\\nIt came in bits.\\n\\nI was a child. I was playing on the lawn at home. I was back on the\\nblazing sea.\\n\\nI was a schoolboy saying my Ovid; then back once more.\\n\\nThe hen-coop was the Lady Jermyn. I was at Eva Denison's side. They were\\nmarrying us on board. The ship's bell was ringing for us; a guitar in\\nthe background burlesqued the Wedding March under skinny fingers; the\\nair was poisoned by a million cigarettes, they raised a pall of smoke\\nabove the mastheads, they set fire to the ship; smoke and flame covered\\nthe sea from rim to rim, smoke and flame filled the universe; the sea\\ndried up, and I was left lying in its bed, lying in my coffin, with\\nred-hot teeth, because the sun blazed right above them, and my withered\\nlips were drawn back from them for ever.\\n\\nSo once more I came back to my living death; too weak now to carry a\\nfinger to the salt water and back to my mouth; too weak to think of Eva;\\ntoo weak to pray any longer for the end, to trouble or to care any more.\\n\\nOnly so tired.\\n\\n         .         .         .         .         .\\n\\nDeath has no more terrors for me. I have supped the last horror of the\\nworst death a man can die. You shall hear now for what I was delivered;\\nyou shall read of my reward.\\n\\nMy floating coffin was many things in turn; a railway carriage, a\\npleasure boat on the Thames, a hammock under the trees; last of all it\\nwas the upper berth in a not very sweet-smelling cabin, with a clatter\\nof knives and forks near at hand, and a very strong odor of onions in\\nthe Irish stew.\\n\\nMy hand crawled to my head; both felt a wondrous weight; and my head\\nwas covered with bristles no longer than those on my chin, only less\\nstubborn.\\n\\n“Where am I?” I feebly asked.\\n\\nThe knives and forks clattered on, and presently I burst out crying\\nbecause they had not heard me, and I knew that I could never make them\\nhear. Well, they heard my sobs, and a huge fellow came with his mouth\\nfull, and smelling like a pickle bottle.\\n\\n“Where am I?”\\n\\n“Aboard the brig Eliza, Liverpool, homeward bound; glad to see them eyes\\nopen.”\\n\\n“Have I been here long?”\\n\\n“Matter o' ten days.”\\n\\n“Where did you find me?”\\n\\n“Floating in a hen-coop; thought you was a dead 'un.”\\n\\n“Do you know what ship?”\\n\\n“Do we know? No, that's what you've got to tell us!”\\n\\n“I can't,” I sighed, too weak to wag my head upon the pillow.\\n\\nThe man went to my cabin door.\\n\\n“Here's a go,” said he; “forgotten the name of his blessed ship, he has.\\nWhere's that there paper, Mr. Bowles? There's just a chance it may be\\nthe same.”\\n\\n“I've got it, sir.”\\n\\n“Well, fetch it along, and come you in, Mr. Bowles; likely you may think\\no' somethin'.”\\n\\nA reddish, hook-nosed man, with a jaunty, wicked look, came and smiled\\nupon me in the friendliest fashion; the smell of onions became more than\\nI knew how to endure.\\n\\n“Ever hear of the ship Lady Jermyn?” asked the first corner, winking at\\nthe other.\\n\\nI thought very hard, the name did sound familiar; but no, I could not\\nhonestly say that I had beard it before.\\n\\nThe captain looked at his mate.\\n\\n“It was a thousand to one,” said he; “still we may as well try him with\\nthe other names. Ever heard of Cap'n Harris, mister?”\\n\\n“Not that I know of.”\\n\\n“Of Saunderson-stooard?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Or Crookes-quartermaster.”\\n\\n“Never.”\\n\\n“Nor yet of Ready--a passenger?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“It's no use goin' on,” said the captain folding up the paper.\\n\\n“None whatever, sir,” said the mate\\n\\n“Ready! Ready!” I repeated. “I do seem to have heard that name before.\\nWon't you give me another chance?”\\n\\nThe paper was unfolded with a shrug.\\n\\n“There was another passenger of the name of San-Santos. Dutchman,\\nseemin'ly. Ever heard o' him?”\\n\\nMy disappointment was keen. I could not say that I had. Yet I would not\\nswear that I had not.\\n\\n“Oh, won't you? Well, there's only one more chance. Ever heard of Miss\\nEva Denison--”\\n\\n“By God, yes! Have you?”\\n\\nI was sitting bolt upright in my bunk. The skipper's beard dropped upon\\nhis chest.\\n\\n“Bless my soul! The last name o' the lot, too!”\\n\\n“Have you heard of her?” I reiterated.\\n\\n“Wait a bit, my lad! Not so fast. Lie down again and tell me who she\\nwas.”\\n\\n“Who she was?” I screamed. “I want to know where she is!”\\n\\n“I can't hardly say,” said the captain awkwardly. “We found the gig o'\\nthe Lady Jermyn the week arter we found you, bein' becalmed like; there\\nwasn't no lady aboard her, though.”\\n\\n“Was there anybody?”\\n\\n“Two dead 'uns--an' this here paper.”\\n\\n“Let me see it!”\\n\\nThe skipper hesitated.\\n\\n“Hadn't you better wait a bit?”\\n\\n“No, no; for Christ's sake let me see the worst; do you think I can't\\nread it in your face?”\\n\\nI could--I did. I made that plain to them, and at last I had the\\npaper smoothed out upon my knees. It was a short statement of the last\\nsufferings of those who had escaped in the gig, and there was nothing\\nin it that I did not now expect. They had buried Ready first--then my\\ndarling--then her step-father. The rest expected to follow fast enough.\\nIt was all written plainly, on a sheet of the log-book, in different\\ntrembling hands. Captain Harris had gone next; and two had been\\ndiscovered dead.\\n\\nHow long I studied that bit of crumpled paper, with the salt spray\\nstill sparkling on it faintly, God alone knows. All at once a peal of\\nnightmare laughter rattled through the cabin. My deliverers started\\nback. The laugh was mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. THE SOLE SURVIVOR\\n\\n\\nA few weeks later I landed in England, I, who no longer desired to set\\nfoot on any land again.\\n\\nAt nine-and-twenty I was gaunt and gray; my nerves were shattered, my\\nheart was broken; and my face showed it without let or hindrance from\\nthe spirit that was broken too. Pride, will, courage, and endurance, all\\nthese had expired in my long and lonely battle with the sea. They had\\nkept me alive-for this. And now they left me naked to mine enemies.\\n\\nFor every hand seemed raised against me, though in reality it was the\\nhand of fellowship that the world stretched out, and the other was the\\nreading of a jaundiced eye. I could not help it: there was a poison in\\nmy veins that made me all ingratitude and perversity. The world welcomed\\nme back, and I returned the compliment by sulking like the recaptured\\nrunaway I was at heart. The world showed a sudden interest in me; so I\\ntook no further interest in the world, but, on the contrary, resented\\nits attentions with unreasonable warmth and obduracy; and my would-be\\nfriends I regarded as my very worst enemies. The majority, I feel sure,\\nmeant but well and kindly by the poor survivor. But the survivor could\\nnot forget that his name was still in the newspapers, nor blink the fact\\nthat he was an unworthy hero of the passing hour. And he suffered\\nenough from brazenly meddlesome and self-seeking folk, from impudent and\\ninquisitive intruders, to justify some suspicion of old acquaintances\\nsuddenly styling themselves old friends, and of distant connections\\nnewly and unduly eager to claim relationship. Many I misjudged, and have\\nlong known it. On the whole, however, I wonder at that attitude of mine\\nas little as I approve of it.\\n\\nIf I had distinguished myself in any other way, it would have been a\\ndifferent thing. It was the fussy, sentimental, inconsiderate\\ninterest in one thrown into purely accidental and necessarily painful\\nprominence--the vulgarization of an unspeakable tragedy--that my soul\\nabhorred. I confess that I regarded it from my own unique and selfish\\npoint of view. What was a thrilling matter to the world was a torturing\\nmemory to me. The quintessence of the torture was, moreover, my own\\nsecret. It was not the loss of the Lady Jermyn that I could not bear to\\nspeak about; it was my own loss; but the one involved the other. My\\nloss apart, however, it was plain enough to dwell upon experiences so\\nterrible and yet so recent as those which I had lived to tell. I did\\nwhat I considered my duty to the public, but I certainly did no more. My\\nreticence was rebuked in the papers that made the most of me, but would\\nfain have made more. And yet I do not think that I was anything but\\ndocile with those who had a manifest right to question me; to the\\nowners, and to other interested persons, with whom I was confronted on\\none pretext or another, I told my tale as fully and as freely as I have\\ntold it here, though each telling hurt more than the last. That was\\nnecessary and unavoidable; it was the private intrusions which I\\nresented with all the spleen the sea had left me in exchange for the\\nqualities it had taken away.\\n\\nRelatives I had as few as misanthropist could desire; but from\\nself-congratulation on the fact, on first landing, I soon came to keen\\nregret. They at least would have sheltered me from spies and busybodies;\\nthey at least would have secured the peace and privacy of one who was\\nno hero in fact or spirit, whose noblest deed was a piece of self\\npreservation which he wished undone with all his heart.\\n\\nSelf-consciousness no doubt multiplied my flattering assailants. I\\nhave said that my nerves were shattered. I may have imagined much and\\nexaggerated the rest. Yet what truth there was in my suspicions you\\nshall duly see. I felt sure that I was followed in the street, and my\\nevery movement dogged by those to whom I would not condescend to turn\\nand look. Meanwhile, I had not the courage to go near my club, and\\nthe Temple was a place where I was accosted in every court, effusively\\ncongratulated on the marvellous preservation of my stale spoilt life,\\nand invited right and left to spin my yarn over a quiet pipe! Well,\\nperhaps such invitations were not so common as they have grown in my\\nmemory; nor must you confuse my then feelings on all these matters with\\nthose which I entertain as I write. I have grown older, and, I hope,\\nsomething kindlier and wiser since then. Yet to this day I cannot blame\\nmyself for abandoning my chambers and avoiding my club.\\n\\nFor a temporary asylum I pitched upon a small, quiet, empty, private\\nhotel which I knew of in Charterhouse Square. Instantly the room next\\nmine became occupied.\\n\\nAll the first night I imagined I heard voices talking about me in that\\nroom next door. It was becoming a disease with me. Either I was being\\ndogged, watched, followed, day and night, indoors and out, or I was the\\nvictim of a very ominous hallucination. That night I never closed an eye\\nnor lowered my light. In the morning I took a four-wheel cab and\\ndrove straight to Harley Street; and, upon my soul, as I stood on the\\nspecialist's door-step, I could have sworn I saw the occupant of the\\nroom next mine dash by me in a hansom!\\n\\n“Ah!” said the specialist; “so you cannot sleep; you hear voices;\\nyou fancy you are being followed in the street. You don't think these\\nfancies spring entirely from the imagination? Not entirely--just so. And\\nyou keep looking behind you, as though somebody were at your elbow; and\\nyou prefer to sit with your back close to the wall. Just so--just so.\\nDistressing symptoms, to be sure, but--but hardly to be wondered at in a\\nman who has come through your nervous strain.” A keen professional light\\nglittered in his eyes. “And almost commonplace,” he added, smiling,\\n“compared with the hallucinations you must have suffered from on that\\nhen-coop! Ah, my dear sir, the psychological interest of your case is\\nvery great!”\\n\\n“It may be,” said I, brusquely. “But I come to you to get that hen-coop\\nout of my head, not to be reminded of it. Everybody asks me about the\\ndamned thing, and you follow everybody else. I wish it and I were at the\\nbottom of the sea together!”\\n\\nThis speech had the effect of really interesting the doctor in my\\npresent condition, which was indeed one of chronic irritation and\\nextreme excitability, alternating with fits of the very blackest\\ndespair. Instead of offending my gentleman I had put him on his mettle,\\nand for half an hour he honored me with the most exhaustive inquisition\\never elicited from a medical man. His panacea was somewhat in the nature\\nof an anti-climax, but at least it had the merits of simplicity and\\nof common sense. A change of air--perfect quiet--say a cottage in the\\ncountry--not too near the sea. And he shook my hand kindly when I left.\\n\\n“Keep up your heart, my dear sir,” said he. “Keep up your courage and\\nyour heart.”\\n\\n“My heart!” I cried. “It's at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.”\\n\\nHe was the first to whom I had said as much. He was a stranger. What did\\nit matter? And, oh, it was so true--so true.\\n\\nEvery day and all day I was thinking of my love; every hour and all\\nhours she was before me with her sunny hair and young, young face. Her\\nwistful eyes were gazing into mine continually. Their wistfulness I\\nhad never realized at the time; but now I did; and I saw it for what it\\nseemed always to have been, the soft, sad, yearning look of one fated\\nto die young. So young--so young! And I might live to be an old man,\\nmourning her.\\n\\nThat I should never love again I knew full well. This time there was no\\nmistake. I have implied, I believe, that it was for another woman I fled\\noriginally to the diggings. Well, that one was still unmarried, and when\\nthe papers were full of me she wrote me a letter which I now believe to\\nhave been merely kind. At the time I was all uncharitableness; but words\\nof mine would fail to tell you how cold this letter left me; it was as a\\ncandle lighted in the full blaze of the sun.\\n\\nWith all my bitterness, however, you must not suppose that I had quite\\nlost the feelings which had inspired me at sunset on the lonely ocean,\\nwhile my mind still held good. I had been too near my Maker ever to lose\\nthose feelings altogether. They were with me in the better moments of\\nthese my worst days. I trusted His wisdom still. There was a reason for\\neverything; there were reasons for all this. I alone had been saved out\\nof all those souls who sailed from Melbourne in the Lady Jermyn. Why\\nshould I have been the favored one; I with my broken heart and now\\nlonely life? Some great inscrutable reason there must be; at my worst\\nI did not deny that. But neither did I puzzle my sick brain with the\\nreason. I just waited for it to be revealed to me, if it were God's will\\never to reveal it. And that I conceive to be the one spirit in which a\\nman may contemplate, with equal sanity and reverence, the mysteries and\\nthe miseries of his life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. I FIND A FRIEND\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night after I consulted the specialist I was quite determined to\\nsleep. I had laid in a bundle of the daily papers. No country cottage\\nwas advertised to let but I knew of it by evening, and about all the\\nlikely ones I had already written. The scheme occupied my thoughts.\\nTrout-fishing was a desideratum. I would take my rod and plenty of\\nbooks, would live simply and frugally, and it should make a new man of\\nme by Christmas. It was now October. I went to sleep thinking of autumn\\ntints against an autumn sunset. It must have been very early, certainly\\nnot later than ten o'clock; the previous night I had not slept at all.\\n\\nNow, this private hotel of mine was a very old fashioned house, dark and\\ndingy all day long, with heavy old chandeliers and black old oak, and\\ndead flowers in broken flower-pots surrounding a grimy grass-plot in the\\nrear. On this latter my bedroom window looked; and never am I likely to\\nforget the vile music of the cats throughout my first long wakeful night\\nthere. The second night they actually woke me; doubtless they had been\\nbusy long enough, but it was all of a sudden that I heard them, and lay\\nlistening for more, wide awake in an instant. My window had been very\\nsoftly opened, and the draught fanned my forehead as I held my breath.\\n\\nA faint light glimmered through a ground-glass pane over the door; and\\nwas dimly reflected by the toilet mirror, in its usual place against the\\nwindow. This mirror I saw moved, and next moment I had bounded from bed.\\n\\nThe mirror fell with a horrid clatter: the toilet-table followed it with\\na worse: the thief had gone as he had come ere my toes halted aching\\namid the debris.\\n\\nA useless little balcony--stone slab and iron railing--jutted out from\\nmy window. I thought I saw a hand on the railing, another on the slab,\\nthen both together on the lower level for one instant before they\\ndisappeared. There was a dull yet springy thud on the grass below. Then\\nno more noise but the distant thunder of the traffic, and the one that\\nwoke me, until the window next mine was thrown up.\\n\\n“What the devil's up?”\\n\\nThe voice was rich, cheery, light-hearted, agreeable; all that my own\\nwas not as I answered “Nothing!” for this was not the first time my\\nnext-door neighbor had tried to scrape acquaintance with me.\\n\\n“But surely, sir, I heard the very dickens of a row?”\\n\\n“You may have done.”\\n\\n“I was afraid some one had broken into your room!”\\n\\n“As a matter of fact,” said I, put to shame by the undiminished\\ngood-humor of my neighbor, “some one did; but he's gone now, so let him\\nbe.”\\n\\n“Gone? Not he! He's getting over that wall. After him--after him!” And\\nthe head disappeared from the window next mine.\\n\\nI rushed into the corridor, and was just in time to intercept a\\nsingularly handsome young fellow, at whom I had hardly taken the trouble\\nto look until now. He was in full evening dress, and his face was\\nradiant with the spirit of mischief and adventure.\\n\\n“For God's sake, sir,” I whispered, “let this matter rest. I shall have\\nto come forward if you persist, and Heaven knows I have been before the\\npublic quite enough!”\\n\\nHis dark eyes questioned me an instant, then fell as though he would not\\ndisguise that he recollected and understood. I liked him for his good\\ntaste. I liked him for his tacit sympathy, and better still for the\\namusing disappointment in his gallant, young face.\\n\\n“I am sorry to have robbed you of a pleasant chase,” said I. “At one\\ntime I should have been the first to join you. But, to tell you the\\ntruth, I've had enough excitement lately to last me for my life.”\\n\\n“I can believe that,” he answered, with his fine eyes full upon me.\\nHow strangely I had misjudged him! I saw no vulgar curiosity in his\\nflattering gaze, but rather that very sympathy of which I stood in need.\\nI offered him my hand.\\n\\n“It is very good of you to give in,” I said. “No one else has heard a\\nthing, you see. I shall look for another opportunity of thanking you\\nto-morrow.”\\n\\n“No, no!” cried he, “thanks be hanged, but--but, I say, if I promise\\nyou not to bore you about things--won't you drink a glass of\\nbrandy-and-water in my room before you turn in again?”\\n\\nBrandy-and-water being the very thing I needed, and this young man\\npleasing me more and more, I said that I would join him with all my\\nheart, and returned to my room for my dressing-gown and slippers. To\\nfind them, however, I had to light my candles, when the first thing\\nI saw was the havoc my marauder had left behind him. The mirror was\\ncracked across; the dressing-table had lost a leg; and both lay flat,\\nwith my brushes and shaving-table, and the foolish toilet crockery which\\nno one uses (but I should have to replace) strewn upon the carpet. But\\none thing I found that had not been there before: under the window lay\\na formidable sheath-knife without its sheath. I picked it up with\\nsomething of a thrill, which did not lessen when I felt its edge. The\\nthing was diabolically sharp. I took it with me to show my neighbor,\\nwhom I found giving his order to the boots; it seemed that it was barely\\nmidnight, and that he had only just come in when the clatter took place\\nin my room.\\n\\n“Hillo!” he cried, when the man was gone, and I produced my trophy.\\n“Why, what the mischief have you got there?”\\n\\n“My caller's card,” said I. “He left it behind him. Feel the edge.”\\n\\nI have seldom seen a more indignant face than the one which my new\\nacquaintance bent over the weapon, as he held it to the light, and ran\\nhis finger along the blade. He could have not frowned more heavily if he\\nhad recognized the knife.\\n\\n“The villains!” he muttered. “The damned villains!”\\n\\n“Villains?” I queried. “Did you see more than one of them, then?”\\n\\n“Didn't you?” he asked quickly. “Yes, yes, to be sure! There was at\\nleast one other beggar skulking down below.” He stood looking at me, the\\nknife in his hand, though mine was held out for it. “Don't you think,\\nMr. Cole, that it's our duty to hand this over to the police? I--I've\\nheard of other cases about these Inns of Court. There's evidently a gang\\nof them, and this knife might convict the lot; there's no saying; anyway\\nI think the police should have it. If you like I'll take it to Scotland\\nYard myself, and hand it over without mentioning your name.”\\n\\n“Oh, if you keep my name out of it,” said I, “and say nothing about\\nit here in the hotel, you may do what you like, and welcome! It's the\\nproper course, no doubt; only I've had publicity enough, and would\\nsooner have felt that blade in my body than set my name going again in\\nthe newspapers.”\\n\\n“I understand,” he said, with his well-bred sympathy, which never went\\na shade too far; and he dropped the weapon into a drawer, as the boots\\nentered with the tray. In a minute he had brewed two steaming jorums of\\nspirits-and-water; as he handed me one, I feared he was going to drink\\nmy health, or toast my luck; but no, he was the one man I had met who\\nseemed, as he said, to “understand.” Nevertheless, he had his toast.\\n\\n“Here's confusion to the criminal classes in general,” he cried; “but\\ndeath and damnation to the owners of that knife!”\\n\\nAnd we clinked tumblers across the little oval table in the middle of\\nthe room. It was more of a sitting-room than mine; a bright fire was\\nburning in the grate, and my companion insisted on my sitting over it\\nin the arm-chair, while for himself he fetched the one from his bedside,\\nand drew up the table so that our glasses should be handy. He then\\nproduced a handsome cigar-case admirably stocked, and we smoked and\\nsipped in the cosiest fashion, though without exchanging many words.\\n\\nYou may imagine my pleasure in the society of a youth, equally charming\\nin looks, manners and address, who had not one word to say to me about\\nthe Lady Jermyn or my hen-coop. It was unique. Yet such, I suppose,\\nwas my native contrariety, that I felt I could have spoken of the\\ncatastrophe to this very boy with less reluctance than to any other\\ncreature whom I had encountered since my deliverance. He seemed so full\\nof silent sympathy: his consideration for my feelings was so marked and\\nyet so unobtrusive. I have called him a boy. I am apt to write as the\\nold man I have grown, though I do believe I felt older then than now.\\nIn any case my young friend was some years my junior. I afterwards found\\nout that he was six-and-twenty.\\n\\nI have also called him handsome. He was the handsomest man that I have\\never met, had the frankest face, the finest eyes, the brightest smile.\\nYet his bronzed forehead was low, and his mouth rather impudent and bold\\nthan truly strong. And there was a touch of foppery about him, in the\\nenormous white tie and the much-cherished whiskers of the fifties, which\\nwas only redeemed by that other touch of devilry that he had shown me\\nin the corridor. By the rich brown of his complexion, as well as by a\\ncertain sort of swagger in his walk, I should have said that he was a\\nnaval officer ashore, had he not told me who he was of his own accord.\\n\\n“By the way,” he said, “I ought to give you my name. It's Rattray,\\nof one of the many Kirby Halls in this country. My one's down in\\nLancashire.”\\n\\n“I suppose there's no need to tell my name?” said I, less sadly, I\\ndaresay, than I had ever yet alluded to the tragedy which I alone\\nsurvived. It was an unnecessary allusion, too, as a reference to the\\nforegoing conversation will show.\\n\\n“Well, no!” said he, in his frank fashion; “I can't honestly say there\\nis.”\\n\\nWe took a few puffs, he watching the fire, and I his firelit face.\\n\\n“It must seem strange to you to be sitting with the only man who lived\\nto tell the tale!”\\n\\nThe egotism of this speech was not wholly gratuitous. I thought it did\\nseem strange to him: that a needless constraint was put upon him by\\nexcessive consideration for my feelings. I desired to set him at his\\nease as he had set me at mine. On the contrary, he seemed quite startled\\nby my remark.\\n\\n“It is strange,” he said, with a shudder, followed by the biggest sip\\nof brandy-and-water he had taken yet. “It must have been\\nhorrible--horrible!” he added to himself, his dark eyes staring into the\\nfire.\\n\\n“Ah!” said I, “it was even more horrible than you suppose or can ever\\nimagine.”\\n\\nI was not thinking of myself, nor of my love, nor of any particular\\nincident of the fire that still went on burning in my brain. My tone was\\ndoubtless confidential, but I was meditating no special confidence when\\nmy companion drew one with his next words. These, however, came after a\\npause, in which my eyes had fallen from his face, but in which I heard\\nhim emptying his glass.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” he whispered. “That there were other\\ncircumstances--things which haven't got into the papers?”\\n\\n“God knows there were,” I answered, my face in my hands; and, my\\ngrief brought home to me, there I sat with it in the presence of that\\nstranger, without compunction and without shame.\\n\\nHe sprang up and paced the room. His tact made me realize my weakness,\\nand I was struggling to overcome it when he surprised me by suddenly\\nstopping and laying a rather tremulous hand upon my shoulder.\\n\\n“You--It wouldn't do you any good to speak of those circumstances, I\\nsuppose?” he faltered.\\n\\n“No: not now: no good at all.”\\n\\n“Forgive me,” he said, resuming his walk. “I had no business--I felt so\\nsorry--I cannot tell you how I sympathize! And yet--I wonder if you will\\nalways feel so?”\\n\\n“No saying how I shall feel when I am a man again,” said I. “You see\\nwhat I am at present.” And, pulling myself together, I rose to find my\\nnew friend quite agitated in his turn.\\n\\n“I wish we had some more brandy,” he sighed. “I'm afraid it's too late\\nto get any now.”\\n\\n“And I'm glad of it,” said I. “A man in my state ought not to look at\\nspirits, or he may never look past them again. Thank goodness, there are\\nother medicines. Only this morning I consulted the best man on nerves in\\nLondon. I wish I'd gone to him long ago.”\\n\\n“Harley Street, was it?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Saw you on his doorstep, by Jove!” cried Rattray at once. “I was\\ndriving over to Hampstead, and I thought it was you. Well, what's the\\nprescription?”\\n\\nIn my satisfaction at finding that he had not been dogging me\\nintentionally (though I had forgotten the incident till he reminded me\\nof it), I answered his question with unusual fulness.\\n\\n“I should go abroad,” said Rattray. “But then, I always am abroad; it's\\nonly the other day I got back from South America, and I shall up anchor\\nagain before this filthy English winter sets in.”\\n\\nWas he a sailor after all, or only a well-to-do wanderer on the face of\\nthe earth? He now mentioned that he was only in England for a few weeks,\\nto have a look at his estate, and so forth; after which he plunged into\\nmore or less enthusiastic advocacy of this or that foreign resort, as\\nopposed to the English cottage upon which I told him I had set my heart.\\n\\nHe was now, however, less spontaneous, I thought, than earlier in the\\nnight. His voice had lost its hearty ring, and he seemed preoccupied, as\\nif talking of one matter while he thought upon another. Yet he would\\nnot let me go; and presently he confirmed my suspicion, no less than my\\nfirst impression of his delightful frankness and cordiality, by candidly\\ntelling me what was on his mind.\\n\\n“If you really want a cottage in the country,” said he, “and the most\\nabsolute peace and quiet to be got in this world, I know of the very\\nthing on my land in Lancashire. It would drive me mad in a week; but if\\nyou really care for that sort of thing--”\\n\\n“An occupied cottage?” I interrupted.\\n\\n“Yes; a couple rent it from me, very decent people of the name of\\nBraithwaite. The man is out all day, and won't bother you when he's in;\\nhe's not like other people, poor chap. But the woman 's all there, and\\nwould do her best for you in a humble, simple, wholesome sort of way.”\\n\\n“You think they would take me in?”\\n\\n“They have taken other men--artists as a rule.”\\n\\n“Then it's a picturesque country?”\\n\\n“Oh, it's that if it's nothing else; but not a town for miles, mind you,\\nand hardly a village worthy the name.”\\n\\n“Any fishing?”\\n\\n“Yes--trout--small but plenty of 'em--in a beck running close behind the\\ncottage.”\\n\\n“Come,” cried I, “this sounds delightful! Shall you be up there?”\\n\\n“Only for a day or two,” was the reply. “I shan't trouble you, Mr.\\nCole.”\\n\\n“My dear sir, that wasn't my meaning at all. I'm only sorry I shall not\\nsee something of you on your own heath. I can't thank you enough for\\nyour kind suggestion. When do you suppose the Braithwaites could do with\\nme?”\\n\\nHis charming smile rebuked my impatience.\\n\\n“We must first see whether they can do with you at all,” said he. “I\\nsincerely hope they can; but this is their time of year for tourists,\\nthough perhaps a little late. I'll tell you what I'll do. As a matter\\nof fact, I'm going down there to-morrow, and I've got to telegraph to my\\nplace in any case to tell them when to meet me. I'll send the telegram\\nfirst thing, and I'll make them send one back to say whether there's\\nroom in the cottage or not.”\\n\\nI thanked him warmly, but asked if the cottage was close to Kirby Hall,\\nand whether this would not be giving a deal of trouble at the other end;\\nwhereupon he mischievously misunderstood me a second time, saying the\\ncottage and the hall were not even in sight of each other, and I really\\nhad no intrusion to fear, as he was a lonely bachelor like myself,\\nand would only be up there four or five days at the most. So I made my\\nappreciation of his society plainer than ever to him; for indeed I\\nhad found a more refreshing pleasure in it already than I had hoped to\\nderive from mortal man again; and we parted, at three o'clock in the\\nmorning, like old fast friends.\\n\\n“Only don't expect too much, my dear Mr. Cole,” were his last words to\\nme. “My own place is as ancient and as tumble-down as most ruins that\\nyou pay to see over. And I'm never there myself because--I tell you\\nfrankly--I hate it like poison!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. A SMALL PRECAUTION\\n\\n\\nMy delight in the society of this young Squire Rattray (as I soon was to\\nhear him styled) had been such as to make me almost forget the sinister\\nincident which had brought us together. When I returned to my room,\\nhowever, there were the open window and the litter on the floor to\\nremind me of what had happened earlier in the night. Yet I was less\\ndisconcerted than you might suppose. A common housebreaker can have\\nfew terrors for one who has braved those of mid-ocean single-handed; my\\nwould-be visitor had no longer any for me; for it had not yet occurred\\nto me to connect him with the voices and the footsteps to which, indeed,\\nI had been unable to swear before the doctor. On the other hand, these\\nmorbid imaginings (as I was far from unwilling to consider them) had\\none and all deserted me in the sane, clean company of the capital young\\nfellow in the next room.\\n\\nI have confessed my condition up to the time of this queer meeting.\\nI have tried to bring young Rattray before you with some hint of his\\nfreshness and his boyish charm; and though the sense of failure is heavy\\nupon me there, I who knew the man knew also that I must fail to do him\\njustice. Enough may have been said, however, to impart some faint idea\\nof what this youth was to me in the bitter and embittering anti-climax\\nof my life. Conventional figures spring to my pen, but every one of them\\nis true; he was flowers in spring, he was sunshine after rain, he was\\nrain following long months of drought. I slept admirably after all;\\nand I awoke to see the overturned toilet-table, and to thrill as I\\nremembered there was one fellow-creature with whom I could fraternize\\nwithout fear of a rude reopening of my every wound.\\n\\nI hurried my dressing in the hope of our breakfasting together. I\\nknocked at the next door, and, receiving no answer, even ventured\\nto enter, with the same idea. He was not there. He was not in the\\ncoffee-room. He was not in the hotel.\\n\\nI broke my fast in disappointed solitude, and I hung about disconsolate\\nall the morning, looking wistfully for my new-made friend. Towards\\nmid-day he drove up in a cab which he kept waiting at the curb.\\n\\n“It's all right!” he cried out in his hearty way. “I sent my telegram\\nfirst thing, and I've had the answer at my club. The rooms are vacant,\\nand I'll see that Jane Braithwaite has all ready for you by to-morrow\\nnight.”\\n\\nI thanked him from my heart. “You seem in a hurry!” I added, as I\\nfollowed him up the stairs.\\n\\n“I am,” said he. “It's a near thing for the train. I've just time to\\nstick in my things.”\\n\\n“Then I'll stick in mine,” said I impulsively, “and I'll come with you,\\nand doss down in any corner for the night.”\\n\\nHe stopped and turned on the stairs.\\n\\n“You mustn't do that,” said he; “they won't have anything ready. I'm\\ngoing to make it my privilege to see that everything is as cosey as\\npossible when you arrive. I simply can't allow you to come to-day, Mr.\\nCole!” He smiled, but I saw that he was in earnest, and of course I gave\\nin.\\n\\n“All right,” said I; “then I must content myself with seeing you off at\\nthe station.”\\n\\nTo my surprise his smile faded, and a flush of undisguised annoyance\\nmade him, if anything, better-looking than ever. It brought out a\\ncertain strength of mouth and jaw which I had not observed there\\nhitherto. It gave him an ugliness of expression which only emphasized\\nhis perfection of feature.\\n\\n“You mustn't do that either,” said he, shortly. “I have an appointment\\nat the station. I shall be talking business all the time.”\\n\\nHe was gone to his room, and I went to mine feeling duly snubbed; yet I\\ndeserved it; for I had exhibited a characteristic (though not chronic)\\nwant of taste, of which I am sometimes guilty to this day. Not to show\\nill-feeling on the head of it, I nevertheless followed him down again\\nin four or five minutes. And I was rewarded by his brightest smile as he\\ngrasped my hand.\\n\\n“Come to-morrow by the same train,” said he, naming station, line, and\\nhour; “unless I telegraph, all will be ready and you shall be met. You\\nmay rely on reasonable charges. As to the fishing, go up-stream--to the\\nright when you strike the beck--and you'll find a good pool or two. I\\nmay have to go to Lancaster the day after to-morrow, but I shall give\\nyou a call when I get back.”\\n\\nWith that we parted, as good friends as ever. I observed that my regret\\nat losing him was shared by the boots, who stood beside me on the steps\\nas his hansom rattled off.\\n\\n“I suppose Mr. Rattray stays here always when he comes to town?” said I.\\n\\n“No, sir,” said the man, “we've never had him before, not in my time;\\nbut I shouldn't mind if he came again.” And he looked twice at the coin\\nin his hand before pocketing it with evident satisfaction.\\n\\nLonely as I was, and wished to be, I think that I never felt my\\nloneliness as I did during the twenty-four hours which intervened\\nbetween Rattray's departure and my own. They dragged like wet days by\\nthe sea, and the effect was as depressing. I have seldom been at such\\na loss for something to do; and in my idleness I behaved like a child,\\nwishing my new friend back again, or myself on the railway with my new\\nfriend, until I blushed for the beanstalk growth of my regard for him,\\nan utter stranger, and a younger man. I am less ashamed of it now: he\\nhad come into my dark life like a lamp, and his going left a darkness\\ndeeper than before.\\n\\nIn my dejection I took a new view of the night's outrage. It was no\\ncommon burglar's work, for what had I worth stealing? It was the work of\\nmy unseen enemies, who dogged me in the street; they alone knew why; the\\ndoctor had called these hallucinations, and I had forced myself to agree\\nwith the doctor; but I could not deceive myself in my present mood.\\nI remembered the steps, the steps--the stopping when I stopped--the\\ndrawing away in the crowded streets---the closing up in quieter places.\\nWhy had I never looked round? Why? Because till to-day I had thought it\\nmere vulgar curiosity; because a few had bored me, I had imagined the\\nmany at my heels; but now I knew--I knew! It was the few again: a few\\nwho hated me even unto death.\\n\\nThe idea took such a hold upon me that I did not trouble my head with\\nreasons and motives. Certain persons had designs upon my life; that was\\nenough for me. On the whole, the thought was stimulating; it set a new\\nvalue on existence, and it roused a certain amount of spirit even in me.\\nI would give the fellows another chance before I left town. They should\\nfollow me once more, and this time to some purpose. Last night they had\\nleft a knife on me; to-night I would have a keepsake ready for them.\\n\\nHitherto I had gone unarmed since my landing, which, perhaps, was no\\nmore than my duty as a civilized citizen. On Black Hill Flats, however,\\nI had formed another habit, of which I should never have broken myself\\nso easily, but for the fact that all the firearms I ever had were\\nreddening and rotting at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. I now went\\nout and bought me such a one as I had never possessed before.\\n\\nThe revolver was then in its infancy; but it did exist; and by dusk\\nI was owner of as fine a specimen as could be procured in the city of\\nLondon. It had but five chambers, but the barrel was ten inches long;\\none had to cap it, and to put in the powder and the wadded bullet\\nseparately; but the last-named would have killed an elephant. The oak\\ncase that I bought with it cumbers my desk as I write, and, shut,\\nyou would think that it had never contained anything more lethal than\\nfruit-knives. I open it, and there are the green-baize compartments, one\\nwith a box of percussion caps, still apparently full, another that could\\nnot contain many more wadded-bullets, and a third with a powder-horn\\nwhich can never have been much lighter. Within the lid is a label\\nbearing the makers' names; the gentlemen themselves are unknown to me,\\neven if they are still alive; nevertheless, after five-and-forty years,\\nlet me dip my pen to Messrs. Deane, Adams and Deane!\\n\\nThat night I left this case in my room, locked, and the key in my\\nwaistcoat pocket; in the right-hand side-pocket of my overcoat I carried\\nmy Deane and Adams, loaded in every chamber; also my right hand, as\\ninnocently as you could wish. And just that night I was not followed! I\\nwalked across Regent's Park, and I dawdled on Primrose Hill, without\\nthe least result. Down I turned into the Avenue Road, and presently was\\nstrolling between green fields towards Finchley. The moon was up, but\\nnicely shaded by a thin coating of clouds which extended across the sky:\\nit was an ideal night for it. It was also my last night in town, and I\\ndid want to give the beggars their last chance. But they did not even\\nattempt to avail themselves of it: never once did they follow me: my\\nears were in too good training to make any mistake. And the reason only\\ndawned on me as I drove back disappointed: they had followed me already\\nto the gunsmith's!\\n\\nConvinced of this, I entertained but little hope of another midnight\\nvisitor. Nevertheless, I put my light out early, and sat a long time\\npeeping through my blind; but only an inevitable Tom, with back hunched\\nup and tail erect, broke the moonlit profile of the back-garden wall;\\nand once more that disreputable music (which none the less had saved my\\nlife) was the only near sound all night.\\n\\nI felt very reluctant to pack Deane and Adams away in his case next\\nmorning, and the case in my portmanteau, where I could not get at it in\\ncase my unknown friends took it into their heads to accompany me out of\\ntown. In the hope that they would, I kept him loaded, and in the same\\novercoat pocket, until late in the afternoon, when, being very near my\\nnorthern destination, and having the compartment to myself, I locked the\\ntoy away with considerable remorse for the price I had paid for it. All\\ndown the line I had kept an eye for suspicious characters with an eye\\nupon me; but even my self-consciousness failed to discover one; and I\\nreached my haven of peace, and of fresh fell air, feeling, I suppose,\\nmuch like any other fool who has spent his money upon a white elephant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. MY CONVALESCENT HOME\\n\\n\\nThe man Braithwaite met me at the station with a spring cart. The very\\nporters seemed to expect me, and my luggage was in the cart before I\\nhad given up my ticket. Nor had we started when I first noticed that\\nBraithwaite did not speak when I spoke to him. On the way, however, a\\nmore flagrant instance recalled young Rattray's remark, that the man was\\n“not like other people.” I had imagined it to refer to a mental, not\\na physical, defect; whereas it was clear to me now that my prospective\\nlandlord was stone-deaf, and I presently discovered him to be dumb as\\nwell. Thereafter I studied him with some attention during our drive of\\nfour or five miles. I called to mind the theory that an innate physical\\ndeficiency is seldom without its moral counterpart, and I wondered how\\nfar this would apply to the deaf-mute at my side, who was ill-grown,\\nwizened, and puny into the bargain. The brow-beaten face of him was\\ncertainly forbidding, and he thrashed his horse up the hills in a\\ndogged, vindictive, thorough-going way which at length made me jump\\nout and climb one of them on foot. It was the only form of protest that\\noccurred to me.\\n\\nThe evening was damp and thick. It melted into night as we drove.\\nI could form no impression of the country, but this seemed desolate\\nenough. I believe we met no living soul on the high road which we\\nfollowed for the first three miles or more. At length we turned into a\\nnarrow lane, with a stiff stone wall on either hand, and this eventually\\nled us past the lights of what appeared to be a large farm; it was\\nreally a small hamlet; and now we were nearing our destination. Gates\\nhad to be opened, and my poor driver breathed hard from the continual\\ngetting down and up. In the end a long and heavy cart-track brought us\\nto the loneliest light that I have ever seen. It shone on the side of a\\nhill--in the heart of an open wilderness--as solitary as a beacon-light\\nat sea. It was the light of the cottage which was to be my temporary\\nhome.\\n\\nA very tall, gaunt woman stood in the doorway against the inner glow.\\nShe advanced with a loose, long stride, and invited me to enter in a\\nvoice harsh (I took it) from disuse. I was warming myself before the\\nkitchen fire when she came in carrying my heaviest box as though it had\\nnothing in it. I ran to take it from her, for the box was full of books,\\nbut she shook her head, and was on the stairs with it before I could\\nintercept her.\\n\\nI conceive that very few men are attracted by abnormal strength in a\\nwoman; we cannot help it; and yet it was not her strength which first\\nrepelled me in Mrs. Braithwaite. It was a combination of attributes. She\\nhad a poll of very dirty and untidy red hair; her eyes were set close\\ntogether; she had the jowl of the traditional prize-fighter. But far\\nmore disagreeable than any single feature was the woman's expression,\\nor rather the expression which I caught her assuming naturally, and\\nbanishing with an effort for my benefit. To me she was strenuously\\ncivil in her uncouth way. But I saw her give her husband one look, as\\nhe staggered in with my comparatively light portmanteau, which she\\ninstantly snatched out of his feeble arms. I saw this look again before\\nthe evening was out, and it was such a one as Braithwaite himself had\\nfixed upon his horse as he flogged it up the hills.\\n\\nI began to wonder how the young squire had found it in his conscience to\\nrecommend such a pair. I wondered less when the woman finally ushered\\nme upstairs to my rooms. These were small and rugged, but eminently snug\\nand clean. In each a good fire blazed cheerfully; my portmanteau was\\nalready unstrapped, the table in the sitting-room already laid; and I\\ncould not help looking twice at the silver and the glass, so bright was\\ntheir condition, so good their quality. Mrs. Braithwaite watched me from\\nthe door.\\n\\n“I doubt you'll be thinking them's our own,” said she. “I wish they\\nwere; t'squire sent 'em in this afternoon.”\\n\\n“For my use?”\\n\\n“Ay; I doubt he thought what we had ourselves wasn't good enough. An'\\nit's him 'at sent t' armchair, t'bed-linen, t'bath, an' that there\\nlookin'-glass an' all.”\\n\\nShe had followed me into the bedroom, where I looked with redoubled\\ninterest at each object as she mentioned it, and it was in the glass--a\\nmasqueline shaving-glass--that I caught my second glimpse of my\\nlandlady's evil expression--levelled this time at myself.\\n\\nI instantly turned round and told her that I thought it very kind of Mr.\\nRattray, but that, for my part, I was not a luxurious man, and that I\\nfelt rather sorry the matter had not been left entirely in her hands.\\nShe retired seemingly mollified, and she took my sympathy with her,\\nthough I was none the less pleased and cheered by my new friend's zeal\\nfor my comfort; there were even flowers on my table, without a doubt\\nfrom Kirby Hall.\\n\\nAnd in another matter the squire had not misled me: the woman was an\\nexcellent plain cook. I expected ham and eggs. Sure enough, this was my\\ndish, but done to a turn. The eggs were new and all unbroken, the ham\\nso lean and yet so tender, that I would not have exchanged my humble,\\nhearty meal for the best dinner served that night in London. It made a\\nnew man of me, after my long journey and my cold, damp drive. I was for\\nchatting with Mrs. Braithwaite when she came up to clear away. I\\nthought she might be glad to talk after the life she must lead with her\\nafflicted husband, but it seemed to have had the opposite effect on her.\\nAll I elicited was an ambiguous statement as to the distance between the\\ncottage and the hall; it was “not so far.” And so she left me to my pipe\\nand to my best night yet, in the stillest spot I have ever slept in\\non dry land; one heard nothing but the bubble of a beck; and it seemed\\nvery, very far away.\\n\\nA fine, bright morning showed me my new surroundings in their true\\ncolors; even in the sunshine these were not very gay. But gayety was the\\nlast thing I wanted. Peace and quiet were my whole desire, and both were\\nhere, set in scenery at once lovely to the eye and bracing to the soul.\\n\\nFrom the cottage doorstep one looked upon a perfect panorama of\\nhealthy, open English country. Purple hills hemmed in a broad, green,\\nundulating plateau, scored across and across by the stone walls of the\\nnorth, and all dappled with the shadows of rolling leaden clouds with\\nsilver fringes. Miles away a church spire stuck like a spike out of the\\nhollow, and the smoke of a village dimmed the trees behind. No nearer\\nhabitation could I see. I have mentioned a hamlet which we passed in the\\nspring-cart. It lay hidden behind some hillocks to the left. My landlady\\ntold me it was better than half a mile away, and “nothing when you get\\nthere; no shop; no post-office; not even a public--house.”\\n\\nI inquired in which direction lay the hall. She pointed to the nearest\\ntrees, a small forest of stunted oaks, which shut in the view to the\\nright, after quarter of a mile of a bare and rugged valley. Through this\\nvalley twisted the beck which I had heard faintly in the night. It ran\\nthrough the oak plantation and so to the sea, some two or three miles\\nfurther on, said my landlady; but nobody would have thought it was so\\nnear.\\n\\n“T'squire was to be away to-day,” observed the woman, with the broad\\nvowel sound which I shall not attempt to reproduce in print. “He was\\ngoing to Lancaster, I believe.”\\n\\n“So I understood,” said I. “I didn't think of troubling him, if that's\\nwhat you mean. I'm going to take his advice and fish the beck.”\\n\\nAnd I proceeded to do so after a hearty early dinner: the keen, chill\\nair was doing me good already: the “perfect quiet” was finding its\\nway into my soul. I blessed my specialist, I blessed Squire Rattray, I\\nblessed the very villains who had brought us within each other's ken;\\nand nowhere was my thanksgiving more fervent than in the deep cleft\\nthreaded by the beck; for here the shrewd yet gentle wind passed\\ncompletely overhead, and the silence was purged of oppression by the\\nceaseless symphony of clear water running over clean stones.\\n\\nBut it was no day for fishing, and no place for the fly, though I went\\nthrough the form of throwing one for several hours. Here the stream\\nmerely rinsed its bed, there it stood so still, in pools of liquid\\namber, that, when the sun shone, the very pebbles showed their shadows\\nin the deepest places. Of course I caught nothing; but, towards the\\nclose of the gold-brown afternoon, I made yet another new acquaintance,\\nin the person of a little old clergyman who attacked me pleasantly from\\nthe rear.\\n\\n“Bad day for fishing, sir,” croaked the cheery voice which first\\ninformed me of his presence. “Ah, I knew it must be a stranger,” he\\ncried as I turned and he hopped down to my side with the activity of a\\nmuch younger man.\\n\\n“Yes,” I said, “I only came down from London yesterday. I find the spot\\nso delightful that I haven't bothered much about the sport. Still, I've\\nhad about enough of it now.” And I prepared to take my rod to pieces.\\n\\n“Spot and sport!” laughed the old gentleman. “Didn't mean it for a\\npun, I hope? Never could endure puns! So you came down yesterday, young\\ngentleman, did you? And where may you be staying?”\\n\\nI described the position of my cottage without the slightest hesitation;\\nfor this parson did not scare me; except in appearance he had so\\nlittle in common with his type as I knew it. He had, however, about the\\nshrewdest pair of eyes that I have ever seen, and my answer only served\\nto intensify their open scrutiny.\\n\\n“How on earth did you come to hear of a God-forsaken place like this?”\\n said he, making use, I thought, of a somewhat stronger expression than\\nquite became his cloth.\\n\\n“Squire Rattray told me of it,” said I.\\n\\n“Ha! So you're a friend of his, are you?” And his eyes went through and\\nthrough me like knitting-needles through a ball of wool.\\n\\n“I could hardly call myself that,” said I. “But Mr. Rattray has been\\nvery kind to me.”\\n\\n“Meet him in town?”\\n\\nI said I had, but I said it with some coolness, for his tone had dropped\\ninto the confidential, and I disliked it as much as this string of\\nquestions from a stranger.\\n\\n“Long ago, sir?” he pursued.\\n\\n“No, sir; not long ago,” I retorted.\\n\\n“May I ask your name?” said he.\\n\\n“You may ask what you like,” I cried, with a final reversal of all my\\nfirst impressions of this impertinent old fellow; “but I'm hanged if\\nI tell it you! I am here for rest and quiet, sir. I don't ask you your\\nname. I can't for the life of me see what right you have to ask me mine,\\nor to question me at all, for that matter.”\\n\\nHe favored me with a brief glance of extraordinary suspicion. It faded\\naway in mere surprise, and, next instant, my elderly and reverend friend\\nwas causing me some compunction by coloring like a boy.\\n\\n“You may think my curiosity mere impertinence, sir,” said he; “you would\\nthink otherwise if you knew as much as I do of Squire Rattray's friends,\\nand how little you resemble the generality of them. You might even feel\\nsome sympathy for one of the neighboring clergy, to whom this godless\\nyoung man has been for years as a thorn in their side.”\\n\\nHe spoke so gravely, and what he said was so easy to believe, that I\\ncould not but apologize for my hasty words.\\n\\n“Don't name it, sir,” said the clergyman; “you had a perfect right to\\nresent my questions, and I enjoy meeting young men of spirit; but not\\nwhen it's an evil spirit, such as, I fear, possesses your friend! I do\\nassure you, sir, that the best thing I have heard of him for years is\\nthe very little that you have told me. As a rule, to hear of him at all\\nin this part of the world, is to wish that we had not heard. I see him\\ncoming, however, and shall detain you no longer, for I don't deny that\\nthere is no love lost between us.”\\n\\nI looked round, and there was Rattray on the top of the bank, a long\\nway to the left, coming towards me with a waving hat. An extraordinary\\nejaculation brought me to the right-about next instant.\\n\\nThe old clergyman had slipped on a stone in mid-stream, and, as he\\ndragged a dripping leg up the opposite bank, he had sworn an oath worthy\\nof the “godless young man” who had put him to flight, and on whose\\ndemerits he had descanted with so much eloquence and indignation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. WINE AND WEAKNESS\\n\\n\\n“Sporting old parson who knows how to swear?” laughed Rattray. “Never saw\\nhim in my life before; wondered who the deuce he was.”\\n\\n“Really?” said I. “He professed to know something of you.”\\n\\n“Against me, you mean? My dear Cole, don't trouble to perjure yourself.\\nI don't mind, believe me. They're easily shocked, these country clergy,\\nand no doubt I'm a bugbear to 'em. Yet, I could have sworn I'd never\\nseen this one before. Let's have another look.”\\n\\nWe were walking away together. We turned on the top of the bank. And\\nthere the old clergyman was planted on the moorside, and watching us\\nintently from under his hollowed hands.\\n\\n“Well, I'm hanged!” exclaimed Rattray, as the hands fell and their\\nowner beat a hasty retreat. My companion said no more; indeed, for some\\nminutes we pursued our way in silence. And I thought that it was with an\\neffort that he broke into sudden inquiries concerning my journey and my\\ncomfort at the cottage.\\n\\nThis gave me an opportunity of thanking him for his little attentions.\\n“It was awfully good of you,” said I, taking his arm as though I had\\nknown him all my life; nor do I think there was another living man with\\nwhom I would have linked arms at that time.\\n\\n“Good?” cried he. “Nonsense, my dear sir! I'm only afraid you find\\nit devilish rough. But, at all events, you're coming to dine with me\\nto-night.”\\n\\n“Am I?” I asked, smiling.\\n\\n“Rather!” said he. “My time here is short enough. I don't lose sight of\\nyou again between this and midnight.”\\n\\n“It's most awfully good of you,” said I again.\\n\\n“Wait till you see! You'll find it rough enough at my place; all my\\nretainers are out for the day at a local show.”\\n\\n“Then I certainly shall not give you the trouble.”\\n\\nHe interrupted me with his jovial laugh.\\n\\n“My good fellow,” he cried, “that's the fun of it! How do you suppose\\nI've been spending the day? Told you I was going to Lancaster, did I?\\nWell, I've been cooking our dinner instead--laying the table--getting\\nup the wines--never had such a joke! Give you my word, I almost forgot I\\nwas in the wilderness!”\\n\\n“So you're quite alone, are you?”\\n\\n“Yes; as much so as that other beggar who was monarch of all he\\nsurveyed, his right there was none to dispute, from the what-is-it down\\nto the glade--”\\n\\n“I'll come,” said I, as we reached the cottage. “Only first you must let\\nme make myself decent.”\\n\\n“You're decent enough!”\\n\\n“My boots are wet; my hands--”\\n\\n“All serene! I'll give you five minutes.”\\n\\nAnd I left him outside, flourishing a handsome watch, while, on my way\\nupstairs, I paused to tell Mrs. Braithwaite that I was dining at the\\nhall. She was busy cooking, and I felt prepared for her unpleasant\\nexpression; but she showed no annoyance at my news. I formed the\\nimpression that it was no news to her. And next minute I heard a\\nwhispering below; it was unmistakable in that silent cottage, where not\\na word had reached me yet, save in conversation to which I was myself a\\nparty.\\n\\nI looked out of window. Rattray I could no longer see. And I confess\\nthat I felt both puzzled and annoyed until we walked away together, when\\nit was his arm which was immediately thrust through mine.\\n\\n“A good soul, Jane,” said he; “though she made an idiotic marriage, and\\nleads a life which might spoil the temper of an archangel. She was my\\nnurse when I was a youngster, Cole, and we never meet without a yarn.”\\n Which seemed natural enough; still I failed to perceive why they need\\nyarn in whispers.\\n\\nKirby Hall proved startlingly near at hand. We descended the bare\\nvalley to the right, we crossed the beck upon a plank, were in the\\noak-plantation about a minute, and there was the hall upon the farther\\nside.\\n\\nAnd a queer old place it seemed, half farm, half feudal castle: fowls\\nstrutting at large about the back premises (which we were compelled to\\nskirt), and then a front door of ponderous oak, deep-set between walls\\nfully six feet thick, and studded all over with wooden pegs. The facade,\\nindeed, was wholly grim, with a castellated tower at one end, and a\\nnumber of narrow, sunken windows looking askance on the wreck and\\nruin of a once prim, old-fashioned, high-walled garden. I thought that\\nRattray might have shown more respect for the house of his ancestors.\\nIt put me in mind of a neglected grave. And yet I could forgive a bright\\nyoung fellow for never coming near so desolate a domain.\\n\\nWe dined delightfully in a large and lofty hall, formerly used (said\\nRattray) as a court-room. The old judgment seat stood back against the\\nwall, and our table was the one at which the justices had been wont to\\nsit. Then the chamber had been low-ceiled; now it ran to the roof, and\\nwe ate our dinner beneath a square of fading autumn sky, with I wondered\\nhow many ghosts looking down on us from the oaken gallery! I was\\ninterested, impressed, awed not a little, and yet all in a way which\\nafforded my mind the most welcome distraction from itself and from the\\npast. To Rattray, on the other hand, it was rather sadly plain that the\\nplace was both a burden and a bore; in fact he vowed it was the dampest\\nand the dullest old ruin under the sun, and that he would sell it\\nto-morrow if he could find a lunatic to buy. His want of sentiment\\nstruck me as his one deplorable trait. Yet even this displayed his\\ncharacteristic merit of frankness. Nor was it at all unpleasant to hear\\nhis merry, boyish laughter ringing round hall and gallery, ere it died\\naway against a dozen closed doors.\\n\\nAnd there were other elements of good cheer: a log fire blazing heartily\\nin the old dog-grate, casting a glow over the stone flags, a reassuring\\nflicker into the darkest corner: cold viands of the very best: and the\\nfinest old Madeira that has ever passed my lips.\\n\\nNow, all my life I have been a “moderate drinker” in the most literal\\nsense of that slightly elastic term. But at the sad time of which I\\nam trying to write, I was almost an abstainer, from the fear, the\\ntemptation--of seeking oblivion in strong waters. To give way then was\\nto go on giving way. I realized the danger, and I took stern measures.\\nNot stern enough, however; for what I did not realize was my weak and\\nnervous state, in which a glass would have the same effect on me as\\nthree or four upon a healthy man.\\n\\nHeaven knows how much or how little I took that evening! I can swear\\nit was the smaller half of either bottle--and the second we never\\nfinished--but the amount matters nothing. Even me it did not make\\ngrossly tipsy. But it warmed my blood, it cheered my heart, it excited\\nmy brain, and--it loosened my tongue. It set me talking with a freedom\\nof which I should have been incapable in my normal moments, on a subject\\nwhereof I had never before spoken of my own free will. And yet the will\\nto--speak--to my present companion--was no novelty. I had felt it at our\\nfirst meeting in the private hotel. His tact, his sympathy, his handsome\\nface, his personal charm, his frank friendliness, had one and all\\ntempted me to bore this complete stranger with unsolicited confidences\\nfor which an inquisitive relative might have angled in vain. And the\\ntemptation was the stronger because I knew in my heart that I should\\nnot bore the young squire at all; that he was anxious enough to hear my\\nstory from my own lips, but too good a gentleman intentionally to\\nbetray such anxiety. Vanity was also in the impulse. A vulgar newspaper\\nprominence had been my final (and very genuine) tribulation; but to\\nplease and to interest one so pleasing and so interesting to me, was\\nanother and a subtler thing. And then there was his sympathy--shall I\\nadd his admiration?--for my reward.\\n\\nI do not pretend that I argued thus deliberately in my heated and\\nexcited brain. I merely hold that all these small reasons and motives\\nwere there, fused and exaggerated by the liquor which was there as well.\\nNor can I say positively that Rattray put no leading questions; only\\nthat I remember none which had that sound; and that, once started, I am\\nafraid I needed only too little encouragement to run on and on.\\n\\nWell, I was set going before we got up from the table. I continued in\\nan armchair that my host dragged from a little book-lined room adjoining\\nthe hall. I finished on my legs, my back to the fire, my hands beating\\nwildly together. I had told my dear Rattray of my own accord more than\\nliving man had extracted from me yet. He interrupted me very little;\\nnever once until I came to the murderous attack by Santos on the drunken\\nsteward.\\n\\n“The brute!” cried Rattray. “The cowardly, cruel, foreign devil! And you\\nnever let out one word of that!”\\n\\n“What was the good?” said I. “They are all gone now--all gone to their\\naccount. Every man of us was a brute at the last. There was nothing to\\nbe gained by telling the public that.”\\n\\nHe let me go on until I came to another point which I had hitherto kept\\nto myself: the condition of the dead mate's fingers: the cries that the\\nsight of them had recalled.\\n\\n“That Portuguese villain again!” cried my companion, fairly leaping from\\nthe chair which I had left and he had taken. “It was the work of the\\nsame cane that killed the steward. Don't tell me an Englishman would\\nhave done it; and yet you said nothing about that either!”\\n\\nIt was my first glimpse of this side of my young host's character. Nor\\ndid I admire him the less, in his spirited indignation, because much of\\nthis was clearly against myself. His eyes flashed. His face was white. I\\nsuddenly found myself the cooler man of the two.\\n\\n“My dear fellow, do consider!” said I. “What possible end could have\\nbeen served by my stating what I couldn't prove against a man who\\ncould never be brought to book in this world? Santos was punished as he\\ndeserved; his punishment was death, and there's an end on't.”\\n\\n“You might be right,” said Rattray, “but it makes my blood boil to hear\\nsuch a story. Forgive me if I have spoken strongly;” and he paced his\\nhall for a little in an agitation which made me like him better and\\nbetter. “The cold-blooded villain!” he kept muttering; “the infernal,\\nforeign, blood-thirsty rascal! Perhaps you were right; it couldn't have\\ndone any good, I know; but--I only wish he'd lived for us to hang him,\\nCole! Why, a beast like that is capable of anything: I wonder if\\nyou've told me the worst even now?” And he stood before me, with candid\\nsuspicion in his fine, frank eyes.\\n\\n“What makes you say that?” said I, rather nettled.\\n\\n“I shan't tell you if it's going to rile you, old fellow,” was his reply.\\nAnd with it reappeared the charming youth whom I found it impossible\\nto resist. “Heaven knows you have had enough to worry you!” he added, in\\nhis kindly, sympathetic voice.\\n\\n“So much,” said I, “that you cannot add to it, my dear Rattray. Now,\\nthen! Why do you think there was something worse?”\\n\\n“You hinted as much in town: rightly or wrongly I gathered there was\\nsomething you would never speak about to living man.”\\n\\nI turned from him with a groan.\\n\\n“Ah! but that had nothing to do with Santos.”\\n\\n“Are you sure?” he cried.\\n\\n“No,” I murmured; “it had something to do with him, in a sense; but\\ndon't ask me any more.” And I leaned my forehead on the high oak\\nmantel-piece, and groaned again.\\n\\nHis hand was upon my shoulder.\\n\\n“Do tell me,” he urged. I was silent. He pressed me further. In my\\nfancy, both hand and voice shook with his sympathy.\\n\\n“He had a step-daughter,” said I at last.\\n\\n“Yes? Yes?”\\n\\n“I loved her. That was all.”\\n\\nHis hand dropped from my shoulder. I remained standing, stooping,\\nthinking only of her whom I had lost for ever. The silence was intense.\\nI could hear the wind sighing in the oaks without, the logs burning\\nsoftly away at my feet And so we stood until the voice of Rattray\\nrecalled me from the deck of the Lady Jermyn and my lost love's side.\\n\\n“So that was all!”\\n\\nI turned and met a face I could not read.\\n\\n“Was it not enough?” cried I. “What more would you have?”\\n\\n“I expected some more-foul play!”\\n\\n“Ah!” I exclaimed bitterly. “So that was all that interested you! No,\\nthere was no more foul play that I know of; and if there was, I don't\\ncare. Nothing matters to me but one thing. Now that you know what that\\nis, I hope you're satisfied.”\\n\\nIt was no way to speak to one's host. Yet I felt that he had pressed me\\nunduly. I hated myself for my final confidence, and his want of sympathy\\nmade me hate him too. In my weakness, however, I was the natural prey\\nof violent extremes. His hand flew out to me. He was about to speak.\\nA moment more and I had doubtless forgiven him. But another sound\\ncame instead and made the pair of us start and stare. It was the soft\\nshutting of some upstairs door.\\n\\n“I thought we had the house to ourselves?” cried I, my miserable nerves\\non edge in an instant.\\n\\n“So did I,” he answered, very pale. “My servants must have come back. By\\nthe Lord Harry, they shall hear of this!”\\n\\nHe sprang to a door, I heard his feet clattering up some stone stairs,\\nand in a trice he was running along the gallery overhead; in another\\nI heard him railing behind some upper door that he had flung open and\\nbanged behind him; then his voice dropped, and finally died away. I was\\nleft some minutes in the oppressively silent hall, shaken, startled,\\nashamed of my garrulity, aching to get away. When he returned it was by\\nanother of the many closed doors, and he found me awaiting him, hat in\\nhand. He was wearing his happiest look until he saw my hat.\\n\\n“Not going?” he cried. “My dear Cole, I can't apologize sufficiently for\\nmy abrupt desertion of you, much less for the cause. It was my man,\\njust come in from the show, and gone up the back way. I accused him of\\nlistening to our conversation. Of course he denies it; but it really\\ndoesn't matter, as I'm sorry to say he's much too 'fresh' (as they call\\nit down here) to remember anything to-morrow morning. I let him have it,\\nI can tell you. Varlet! Caitiff! But if you bolt off on the head of it,\\nI shall go back and sack him into the bargain!”\\n\\nI assured him I had my own reasons for wishing to retire early. He could\\nhave no conception of my weakness, my low and nervous condition of\\nbody and mind; much as I had enjoyed myself, he must really let me go.\\nAnother glass of wine, then? Just one more? No, I had drunk too much\\nalready. I was in no state to stand it. And I held out my hand with\\ndecision.\\n\\nInstead of taking it he looked at me very hard.\\n\\n“The place doesn't suit you,” said he. “I see it doesn't, and I'm\\ndevilish sorry! Take my advice and try something milder; now do,\\nto-morrow; for I should never forgive myself if it made you worse\\ninstead of better; and the air is too strong for lots of people.”\\n\\nI was neither too ill nor too vexed to laugh outright in his face.\\n\\n“It's not the air,” said I; “it's that splendid old Madeira of yours,\\nthat was too strong for me, if you like! No, no, Rattray, you don't get\\nrid of me so cheaply-much as you seem to want to!”\\n\\n“I was only thinking of you,” he rejoined, with a touch of pique that\\nconvinced me of his sincerity. “Of course I want you to stop, though\\nI shan't be here many days; but I feel responsible for you, Cole,\\nand that's the fact. Think you can find your way?” he continued,\\naccompanying me to the gate, a postern in the high garden wall. “Hadn't\\nyou better have a lantern?”\\n\\nNo; it was unnecessary. I could see splendidly, had the bump of locality\\nand as many more lies as would come to my tongue. I was indeed burning\\nto be gone.\\n\\nA moment later I feared that I had shown this too plainly. For his final\\nhandshake was hearty enough to send me away something ashamed of\\nmy precipitancy, and with a further sense of having shown him\\nsmall gratitude for his kindly anxiety on my behalf. I would behave\\ndifferently to-morrow. Meanwhile I had new regrets.\\n\\nAt first it was comparatively easy to see, for the lights of the house\\nshone faintly among the nearer oaks. But the moon was hidden behind\\nheavy clouds, and I soon found myself at a loss in a terribly dark zone\\nof timber. Already I had left the path. I felt in my pocket for matches.\\nI had none.\\n\\nMy head was now clear enough, only deservedly heavy. I was still\\nquarrelling with myself for my indiscretions and my incivilities, one\\nand all the result of his wine and my weakness, and this new predicament\\n(another and yet more vulgar result) was the final mortification. I\\nswore aloud. I simply could not see a foot in front of my face. Once I\\nproved it by running my head hard against a branch. I was hopelessly and\\nridiculously lost within a hundred yards of the hall!\\n\\nSome minutes I floundered, ashamed to go back, unable to proceed for\\nthe trees and the darkness. I heard the beck running over its stones. I\\ncould still see an occasional glimmer from the windows I had left. But\\nthe light was now on this side, now on that; the running water chuckled\\nin one ear after the other; there was nothing for it but to return in\\nall humility for the lantern which I had been so foolish as to refuse.\\n\\nAnd as I resigned myself to this imperative though inglorious course, my\\nheart warmed once more to the jovial young squire. He would laugh, but\\nnot unkindly, at my grotesque dilemma; at the thought of his laughter I\\nbegan to smile myself. If he gave me another chance I would smoke that\\ncigar with him before starting home afresh, and remove, from my own\\nmind no less than from his, all ill impressions. After all it was not\\nhis fault that I had taken too much of his wine; but a far worse offence\\nwas to be sulky in one's cups. I would show him that I was myself again\\nin all respects. I have admitted that I was temporarily, at all events,\\na creature of extreme moods. It was in this one that I retraced my steps\\ntowards the lights, and at length let myself into the garden by the\\npostern at which I had shaken Rattray's hand not ten minutes before.\\n\\nTaking heart of grace, I stepped up jauntily to the porch. The weeds\\nmuffled my steps. I myself had never thought of doing so, when all at\\nonce I halted in a vague terror. Through the deep lattice windows I\\nhad seen into the lighted hall. And Rattray was once more seated at his\\ntable, a little company of men around him.\\n\\nI crept nearer, and my heart stopped. Was I delirious, or raving mad\\nwith wine? Or had the sea given up its dead?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI. I LIVE AGAIN\\n\\n\\nSquire Rattray, as I say, was seated at the head of his table, where\\nthe broken meats still lay as he and I had left them; his fingers, I\\nremember, were playing with a crust, and his eyes fixed upon a distant\\ndoor, as he leant back in his chair. Behind him hovered the nigger of\\nthe Lady Jermyn, whom I had been the slower to recognize, had not her\\nskipper sat facing me on the squire's right. Yes, there was Captain\\nHarris in the flesh, eating heartily between great gulps of wine,\\ninstead of feeding the fishes as all the world supposed. And nearer\\nstill, nearer me than any, with his back to my window but his chair\\nslued round a little, so that he also could see that door, and I his\\nprofile, sat Joaquin Santos with his cigarette!\\n\\nNone spoke; all seemed waiting; and all were silent but the captain,\\nwhose vulgar champing reached me through the crazy lattice, as I stood\\nspellbound and petrified without.\\n\\nThey say that a drowning man lives his life again before the last; but\\nmy own fight with the sea provided me with no such moments of vivid and\\nrapid retrospect as those during which I stood breathless outside the\\nlighted windows of Kirby Hall. I landed again. I was dogged day and\\nnight. I set it down to nerves and notoriety; but took refuge in a\\nprivate hotel. One followed me, engaged the next room, set a watch on\\nall my movements; another came in by the window to murder me in my\\nbed; no party to that, the first one nevertheless turned the outrage to\\naccount, wormed himself into my friendship on the strength of it, and\\nlured me hither, an easy prey. And here was the gang of them, to meet\\nme! No wonder Rattray had not let me see him off at the station; no\\nwonder I had not been followed that night. Every link I saw in its\\nright light instantly. Only the motive remained obscure. Suspicious\\ncircumstances swarmed upon my slow perception: how innocent I had been!\\nLess innocent, however, than wilfully and wholly reckless: what had it\\nmattered with whom I made friends? What had anything mattered to me?\\nWhat did anything matter--\\n\\nI thought my heart had snapped!\\n\\nWhy were they watching that door, Joaquin Santos and the young squire?\\nWhom did they await? I knew! Oh, I knew! My heart leaped, my blood\\ndanced, my eyes lay in wait with theirs. Everything began to matter\\nonce more. It was as though the machinery of my soul, long stopped, had\\nsuddenly been set in motion; it was as though I was born again.\\n\\nHow long we seemed to wait I need not say. It cannot have been many\\nmoments in reality, for Santos was blowing his rings of smoke in the\\ndirection of the door, and the first that I noticed were but dissolving\\nwhen it opened--and the best was true! One instant I saw her very\\nclearly, in the light of a candle which she carried in its silver stick;\\nthen a mist blinded me, and I fell on my knees in the rank bed into\\nwhich I had stepped, to give such thanks to the Almighty as this heart\\nhas never felt before or since. And I remained kneeling; for now my face\\nwas on a level with the sill; and when my eyes could see again, there\\nstood my darling before them in the room.\\n\\nLike a queen she stood, in the very travelling cloak in which I had seen\\nher last; it was tattered now, but she held it close about her as though\\na shrewd wind bit her to the core. Her sweet face was all peeked and\\npale in the candle-light: she who had been a child was come to womanhood\\nin a few weeks. But a new spirit flashed in her dear eyes, a new\\nstrength hardened her young lips. She stood as an angel brought to book\\nby devils; and so noble was her calm defiance, so serene her scorn,\\nthat, as I watched and listened; all present fear for her passed out of\\nmy heart.\\n\\nThe first sound was the hasty rising of young Rattray; he was at Eva's\\nside next instant, essaying to lead her to his chair, with a flush which\\ndeepened as she repulsed him coldly.\\n\\n“You have sent for me, and I have come,” said she. “But I prefer not to\\nsit down in your presence; and what you have to say, you will be good\\nenough to say as quickly as possible, that I may go again before I\\nam--stifled!”\\n\\nIt was her one hot word; aimed at them all, it seemed to me to fall like\\na lash on Rattray's cheek, bringing the blood to it like lightning. But\\nit was Santos who snatched the cigarette from his mouth, and opened upon\\nthe defenceless girl in a torrent of Portuguese, yellow with rage, and a\\nvery windmill of lean arms and brown hands in the terrifying rapidity of\\nhis gesticulations. They did not terrify Eva Denison. When Rattray took\\na step towards the speaker, with flashing eyes, it was some word from\\nEva that checked him; when Santos was done, it was to Rattray that she\\nturned with her answer.\\n\\n“He calls me a liar for telling you that Mr. Cole knew all,” said she,\\nthrilling me with my own name. “Don't you say anything,” she added, as\\nthe young man turned on Santos with a scowl; “you are one as wicked as\\nthe other, but there was a time when I thought differently of you: his\\ncharacter I have always known. Of the two evils, I prefer to speak to\\nyou.”\\n\\nRattray bowed, humbly enough, I thought; but my darling's nostrils only\\ncurled the more.\\n\\n“He calls me a liar,” she continued; “so may you all. Since you have\\nfound it out, I admit it freely and without shame; one must be false in\\nthe hands of false fiends like all of you. Weakness is nothing to you;\\nhelplessness is nothing; you must be met with your own weapons, and so I\\nlied in my sore extremity to gain the one miserable advantage within my\\nreach. He says you found me out by making friends with Mr. Cole. He\\nsays that Mr. Cole has been dining with you in this very room, this\\nvery night. You still tell the truth sometimes; has that man--that\\ndemon--told it for once?”\\n\\n“It is perfectly true,” said Rattray in a low voice.\\n\\n“And poor Mr. Cole told you that he knew nothing of your villany?”\\n\\n“I found out that he knew absolutely nothing--after first thinking\\notherwise.”\\n\\n“Suppose he had known? What would you have done?”\\n\\nRattray said nothing. Santos shrugged as he lit a fresh cigarette. The\\ncaptain went on with his supper.\\n\\n“Ashamed to say!” cried Eva Denison. “So you have some shame left still!\\nWell, I will tell you. You would have murdered him, as you murdered all\\nthe rest; you would have killed him in cold blood, as I wish and pray\\nthat you would kill me!”\\n\\nThe young fellow faced her, white to the lips. “You have no right to\\nsay that, Miss Denison!” he cried. “I may be bad, but, as I am ready to\\nanswer for my sins, the crime of murder is not among them.”\\n\\nWell, it is still some satisfaction to remember that my love never\\npunished me with such a look as was the young squire's reward for this\\nprotestation. The curl of the pink nostrils, the parting of the proud\\nlips, the gleam of the sound white teeth, before a word was spoken,\\nwere more than I, for one, could have borne. For I did not see the grief\\nunderlying the scorn, but actually found it in my heart to pity this\\npoor devil of a Rattray: so humbly fell those fine eyes of his, so like\\na dog did he stand, waiting to be whipped.\\n\\n“Yes; you are very innocent!” she began at last, so softly that I could\\nscarcely hear. “You have not committed murder, so you say; let it stand\\nto your credit by all means. You have no blood upon your hands; you say\\nso; that is enough. No! you are comparatively innocent, I admit. All\\nyou have done is to make murder easy for others; to get others to do the\\ndirty work, and then shelter them and share the gain; all you need have\\non your conscience is every life that was lost with the Lady Jermyn, and\\nevery soul that lost itself in losing them. You call that innocence?\\nThen give me honest guilt! Give me the man who set fire to the ship, and\\nwho sits there eating his supper; he is more of a man than you. Give me\\nthe wretch who has beaten men to death before my eyes; there's something\\ngreat about a monster like that, there's something to loathe. His\\nassistant is only little--mean--despicable!” Loud and hurried in its\\nwrath, low and deliberate in its contempt, all this was uttered with a\\nfurious and abnormal eloquence, which would have struck me, loving her,\\nto the ground. On Rattray it had a different effect. His head lifted as\\nshe heaped abuse upon it, until he met her flashing eye with that of a\\nman very thankful to take his deserts and something more; and to mine he\\nwas least despicable when that last word left her lips. When he saw that\\nit was her last, he took her candle (she had put it down on the ancient\\nsettle against the door), and presented it to her with another bow. And\\nso without a word he led her to the door, opened it, and bowed yet lower\\nas she swept out, but still without a tinge of mockery in the obeisance.\\n\\nHe was closing the door after her when Joaquin Santos reached it.\\n\\n“Diablo!” cried he. “Why let her go? We have not done with her.”\\n\\n“That doesn't matter; she is done with us,” was the stern reply.\\n\\n“It does matter,” retorted Santos; “what is more, she is my\\nstep-daughter, and back she shall come!”\\n\\n“She is also my visitor, and I'm damned if you're going to make her!”\\n\\nAn instant Santos stood, his back to me, his fingers working, his neck\\nbrown with blood; then his coat went into creases across the shoulders,\\nand he was shrugging still as he turned away.\\n\\n“Your veesitor!” said he. “Your veesitor! Your veesitor!”\\n\\nHarris laughed outright as he raised his glass; the hot young squire\\nhad him by the collar, and the wine was spilling on the cloth, as I rose\\nvery cautiously and crept back to the path.\\n\\n“When rogues fall out!” I was thinking to myself. “I shall save her\\nyet--I shall save my darling!”\\n\\nAlready I was accustomed to the thought that she still lived, and to the\\nbig heart she had set beating in my feeble frame; already the continued\\nexistence of these villains, with the first dim inkling of their\\nvillainy, was ceasing to be a novelty in a brain now quickened and\\nprehensile beyond belief. And yet--but a few minutes had I knelt at the\\nwindow--but a few more was it since Rattray and I had shaken hands!\\n\\nNot his visitor; his prisoner, without a doubt; but alive! alive! and,\\nneither guest nor prisoner for many hours more. O my love! O my heart's\\ndelight! Now I knew why I was spared; to save her; to snatch her from\\nthese rascals; to cherish and protect her evermore!\\n\\nAll the past shone clear behind me; the dark was lightness and the\\ncrooked straight. All the future lay clear ahead it presented no\\ndifficulties yet; a mad, ecstatic confidence was mine for the wildest,\\nhappiest moments of my life.\\n\\nI stood upright in the darkness. I saw her light!\\n\\nIt was ascending the tower at the building's end; now in this window it\\nglimmered, now in the one above. At last it was steady, high up near the\\nstars, and I stole below.\\n\\n“Eva! Eva!”\\n\\nThere was no answer. Low as it was, my voice was alarming; it cooled\\nand cautioned me. I sought little stones. I crept back to throw them.\\nAh God! her form eclipsed that lighted slit in the gray stone tower. I\\nheard her weeping high above me at her window.\\n\\n“Eva! Eva!”\\n\\nThere was a pause, and then a little cry of gladness.\\n\\n“Is it Mr. Cole?” came in an eager whisper through her tears.\\n\\n“Yes! yes! I was outside the window. I heard everything.”\\n\\n“They will hear you!” she cried softly, in a steadier voice.\\n\\n“No-listen!” They were quarrelling. Rattray's voice was loud and angry.\\n“They cannot hear,” I continued, in more cautious tones; “they think\\nI'm in bed and asleep half-a-mile away. Oh, thank God! I'll get you away\\nfrom them; trust me, my love, my darling!”\\n\\nIn my madness I knew not what I said; it was my wild heart speaking.\\nSome moments passed before she replied.\\n\\n“Will you promise to do nothing I ask you not to do?”\\n\\n“Of course.”\\n\\n“My life might answer for it--”\\n\\n“I promise--I promise.”\\n\\n“Then wait--hide--watch my light. When you see it back in the window,\\nwatch with all your eyes! I am going to write and then throw it out. Not\\nanother syllable!”\\n\\nShe was gone; there was a long yellow slit in the masonry once more; her\\nlight burnt faint and far within.\\n\\nI retreated among some bushes and kept watch.\\n\\nThe moon was skimming beneath the surface of a sea of clouds: now the\\nblack billows had silver crests: now an incandescent buoy bobbed among\\nthem. O for enough light, and no more!\\n\\nIn the hall the high voices were more subdued. I heard the captain's\\ntipsy laugh. My eyes fastened themselves upon that faint and lofty\\nlight, and on my heels I crouched among the bushes.\\n\\nThe flame moved, flickered, and shone small but brilliant on the very\\nsill. I ran forward on tip-toe. A white flake fluttered to my feet. I\\nsecured it and waited for one word; none came; but the window was softly\\nshut.\\n\\nI stood in doubt, the treacherous moonlight all over me now, and once\\nmore the window opened.\\n\\n“Go quickly!”\\n\\nAnd again it was shut; next moment I was stealing close by the spot\\nwhere I had knelt. I saw within once more.\\n\\nHarris nodded in his chair. The nigger had disappeared. Rattray was\\nlighting a candle, and the Portuguese holding out his hand for the\\nmatch.\\n\\n“Did you lock the gate, senhor?” asked Santos.\\n\\n“No; but I will now.”\\n\\nAs I opened it I heard a door open within. I could hardly let the latch\\ndown again for the sudden trembling of my fingers. The key turned behind\\nme ere I had twenty yards' start.\\n\\nThank God there was light enough now! I followed the beck. I found\\nmy way. I stood in the open valley, between the oak-plantation and my\\ndesolate cottage, and I kissed my tiny, twisted note again and again in\\na paroxysm of passion and of insensate joy. Then I unfolded it and held\\nit to my eyes in the keen October moonshine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII. MY LADY'S BIDDING\\n\\n\\nScribbled in sore haste, by a very tremulous little hand, with a pencil,\\non the flyleaf of some book, my darling's message is still difficult to\\nread; it was doubly so in the moonlight, five-and-forty autumns ago. My\\neyesight, however, was then perhaps the soundest thing about me, and in\\na little I had deciphered enough to guess correctly (as it proved) at\\nthe whole:--\\n\\n\\n“You say you heard everything just now, and there is no time for further\\nexplanations. I am in the hands of villains, but not ill-treated, though\\nthey are one as bad as the other. You will not find it easy to rescue\\nme. I don't see how it is to be done. You have promised not to do\\nanything I ask you not to do, and I implore you not to tell a soul until\\nyou have seen me again and heard more. You might just as well kill me as\\ncome back now with help.\\n\\n“You see you know nothing, though I told them you knew all. And so you\\nshall as soon as I can see you for five minutes face to face. In the\\nmeantime do nothing--know nothing when you see Mr. Rattray--unless you\\nwish to be my death.\\n\\n“It would have been possible last night, and it may be again to-morrow\\nnight. They all go out every night when they can, except Jose, who is\\nleft in charge. They are out from nine or ten till two or three; if they\\nare out to-morrow night my candle will be close to the window as I shall\\nput it when I have finished this. You can see my window from over the\\nwall. If the light is in front you must climb the wall, for they will\\nleave the gate locked. I shall see you and will bribe Jose to let me\\nout for a turn. He has done it before for a bottle of wine. I can manage\\nhim. Can I trust to you? If you break your promise--but you will not?\\nOne of them would as soon kill me as smoke a cigarette, and the rest are\\nunder his thumb. I dare not write more. But my life is in your hands.\\n\\n“EVA DENISON.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh! beware of the woman Braithwaite; she is about the worst of the\\ngang.”\\n\\nI could have burst out crying in my bitter discomfiture, mortification,\\nand alarm: to think that her life was in my hands, and that it depended,\\nnot on that prompt action which was the one course I had contemplated,\\nbut on twenty-four hours of resolute inactivity! I would not think it.\\nI refused the condition. It took away my one prop, my one stay, that\\nprospect of immediate measures which alone preserved in me such coolness\\nas I had retained until now. I was cool no longer; where I had relied\\non practical direction I was baffled and hindered and driven mad; on my\\nhonor believe I was little less for some moments, groaning, cursing,\\nand beating the air with impotent fists--in one of them my poor love's\\nletter crushed already to a ball.\\n\\nDanger and difficulty I had been prepared to face; but the task that I\\nwas set was a hundred-fold harder than any that had whirled through my\\nteeming brain. To sit still; to do nothing; to pretend I knew nothing;\\nan hour of it would destroy my reason--and I was invited to wait\\ntwenty-four!\\n\\nNo; my word was passed; keep it I must. She knew the men, she must know\\nbest; and her life depended on my obedience: she made that so plain.\\nObey I must and would; to make a start, I tottered over the plank that\\nspanned the beck, and soon I saw the cottage against the moonlit sky.\\nI came up to it. I drew back in sudden fear. It was alight upstairs and\\ndown, and the gaunt strong figure of the woman Braithwaite stood out\\nas I had seen it first, in the doorway, with the light showing warmly\\nthrough her rank red hair.\\n\\n“Is that you, Mr. Cole?” she cried in a tone that she reserved for me;\\nyet through the forced amiability there rang a note of genuine surprise.\\nShe had been prepared for me never to return at all!\\n\\nMy knees gave under me as I forced myself to advance; but my wits took\\nnew life from the crisis, and in a flash I saw how to turn my weakness\\ninto account. I made a false step on my way to the door; when I reached\\nit I leant heavily against the jam, and I said with a slur that I felt\\nunwell. I had certainly been flushed with wine when I left Rattray; it\\nwould be no bad thing for him to hear that I had arrived quite tipsy at\\nthe cottage; should he discover I had been near an hour on the way, here\\nwas my explanation cut and dried.\\n\\nSo I shammed a degree of intoxication with apparent success, and Jane\\nBraithwaite gave me her arm up the stairs. My God, how strong it was,\\nand how weak was mine!\\n\\nLeft to myself, I reeled about my bedroom, pretending to undress; then\\nout with my candles, and into bed in all my clothes, until the cottage\\nshould be quiet. Yes, I must lie still and feign sleep, with every nerve\\nand fibre leaping within me, lest the she-devil below should suspect\\nme of suspicions! It was with her I had to cope for the next\\nfour-and-twenty hours; and she filled me with a greater present terror\\nthan all those villains at the hall; for had not their poor little\\nhelpless captive described her as “about the worst of the gang?”\\n\\nTo think that my love lay helpless there in the hands of those wretches;\\nand to think that her lover lay helpless here in the supervision of this\\nvile virago!\\n\\nIt must have been one or two in the morning when I stole to my\\nsitting-room window, opened it, and sat down to think steadily, with the\\ncounterpane about my shoulders.\\n\\nThe moon sailed high and almost full above the clouds; these were\\ndispersing as the night wore on, and such as remained were of a\\nbeautiful soft tint between white and gray. The sky was too light for\\nstars, and beneath it the open country stretched so clear and far that\\nit was as though one looked out at noonday through slate-colored glass.\\nDown the dewy slope below my window a few calves fed with toothless\\nmouthings; the beck was very audible, the oak-trees less so; but for\\nthese peaceful sounds the stillness and the solitude were equally\\nintense.\\n\\nI may have sat there like a mouse for half an hour. The reason was that\\nI had become mercifully engrossed in one of the subsidiary problems:\\nwhether it would be better to drop from the window or to trust to the\\ncreaking stairs. Would the creaking be much worse than the thud, and\\nthe difference worth the risk of a sprained ankle? Well worth it, I at\\nlength decided; the risk was nothing; my window was scarce a dozen feet\\nfrom the ground. How easily it could be done, how quickly, how safely in\\nthis deep, stillness and bright moonlight! I would fall so lightly on\\nmy stocking soles; a single soft, dull thud; then away under the moon\\nwithout fear or risk of a false step; away over the stone walls to the\\nmain road, and so to the nearest police-station with my tale; and before\\nsunrise the villains would be taken in their beds, and my darling would\\nbe safe!\\n\\nI sprang up softly. Why not do it now? Was I bound to keep my rash,\\nblind promise? Was it possible these murderers would murder her?\\nI struck a match on my trousers, I lit a candle, I read her letter\\ncarefully again, and again it maddened and distracted me. I struck my\\nhands together. I paced the room wildly. Caution deserted me, and I made\\nnoise enough to wake the very mute; lost to every consideration but that\\nof the terrifying day before me, the day of silence and of inactivity,\\nthat I must live through with an unsuspecting face, a cool head, a civil\\ntongue! The prospect appalled me as nothing else could or did; nay, the\\nsudden noise upon the stairs, the knock at my door, and the sense that\\nI had betrayed myself already even now all was over--these came as a\\nrelief after the haunting terror which they interrupted.\\n\\nI flung the door open, and there stood Mrs. Braithwaite, as fully\\ndressed as myself.\\n\\n“You'll not be very well sir?”\\n\\n“No, I'm not.”\\n\\n“What's t' matter wi' you?”\\n\\nThis second question was rude and fierce with suspicion: the real woman\\nrang out in it, yet its effect on me was astonishing: once again was I\\ninspired to turn my slip into a move.\\n\\n“Matter?” I cried. “Can't you see what's the matter; couldn't you see\\nwhen I came in? Drink's the matter! I came in drunk, and now I'm mad. I\\ncan't stand it; I'm not in a fit state. Do you know nothng of me? Have\\nthey told you nothing? I'm the only man that was saved from the Lady\\nJermyn, the ship that was burned to the water's edge with every soul but\\nme. My nerves are in little ends. I came down here for peace and quiet\\nand sleep. Do you know that I have hardly slept for two months? And now\\nI shall never sleep again! O my God I shall die for want of it! The wine\\nhas done it. I never should have touched a drop. I can't stand it; I\\ncan't sleep after it; I shall kill myself if I get no sleep. Do you\\nhear, you woman? I shall kill myself in your house if I don't get to\\nsleep!”\\n\\nI saw her shrink, virago as she was. I waved my arms, I shrieked in\\nher face. It was not all acting. Heaven knows how true it was about the\\nsleep. I was slowly dying of insomnia. I was a nervous wreck. She must\\nhave heard it. Now she saw it for herself.\\n\\nNo; it was by no means all acting. Intending only to lie, I found\\nmyself telling little but the strictest truth, and longing for sleep as\\npassionately as though I had nothing to keep me awake. And yet, while my\\nheart cried aloud in spite of me, and my nerves relieved themselves in\\nthis unpremeditated ebullition, I was all the time watching its effect\\nas closely as though no word of it had been sincere.\\n\\nMrs. Braithwaite seemed frightened; not at all pitiful; and as I calmed\\ndown she recovered her courage and became insolent. I had spoilt her\\nnight. She had not been told she was to take in a raving lunatic. She\\nwould speak to Squire Rattray in the morning.\\n\\n“Morning?” I yelled after her as she went. “Send your husband to the\\nnearest chemist as soon as it's dawn; send him for chloral, chloroform,\\nmorphia, anything they've got and as much of it as they'll let him have.\\nI'll give you five pounds if you get me what'll send me to sleep all\\nto-morrow--and to-morrow night!”\\n\\nNever, I feel sure, were truth and falsehood more craftily interwoven;\\nyet I had thought of none of it until the woman was at my door, while of\\nmuch I had not thought at all. It had rushed from my heart and from my\\nlips. And no sooner was I alone than I burst into hysterical tears, only\\nto stop and compliment myself because they sounded genuine--as though\\nthey were not! Towards morning I took to my bed in a burning fever, and\\nlay there, now congratulating myself upon it, because when night came\\nthey would all think me so secure; and now weeping because the night\\nmight find me dying or dead. So I tossed, with her note clasped in my\\nhand underneath the sheets; and beneath my very body that stout weapon\\nthat I had bought in town. I might not have to use it, but I was\\nfatalist enough to fancy that I should. In the meantime it helped me to\\nlie still, my thoughts fixed on the night, and the day made easy for me\\nafter all.\\n\\nIf only I could sleep!\\n\\nAbout nine o'clock Jane Braithwaite paid me a surly visit; in half an\\nhour she was back with tea and toast and an altered mien. She not only\\nlit my fire, but treated me the while to her original tone of almost\\nfervent civility and respect and determination. Her vagaries soon ceased\\nto puzzle me: the psychology of Jane Braithwaite was not recondite. In\\nthe night it had dawned upon her that Rattray had found me harmless and\\nwas done with me, therefore there was no need for her to put herself out\\nany further on my account. In the morning, finding me really ill, she\\nhad gone to the hall in alarm; her subsequent attentions were an act of\\nobedience; and in their midst came Rattray himself to my bedside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII. THE LONGEST DAY OF MY LIFE\\n\\n\\nThe boy looked so blithe and buoyant, so gallant and still so frank,\\nthat even now I could not think as meanly of him as poor Eva did. A\\nrogue he must be, but surely not the petty rogue that she had made him\\nout. Yet it was dirty work that he had done by me; and there I had to\\nlie and take his kind, false, felon's hand in mine.\\n\\n“My poor dear fellow,” he cried, “I'm most sorry to find you like this.\\nBut I was afraid of it last night. It's all this infernally strong air!”\\n\\nHow I longed to tell him what it was, and to see his face! The thought\\nof Eva alone restrained me, and I retorted as before, in a tone I strove\\nto make as friendly, that it was his admirable wine and nothing else.\\n\\n“But you took hardly any.”\\n\\n“I shouldn't have touched a drop. I can't stand it. Instead of soothing\\nme it excites me to the verge of madness. I'm almost over the verge--for\\nwant of sleep--my trouble ever since the trouble.”\\n\\nAgain I was speaking the literal truth, and again congratulating myself\\nas though it were a lie: the fellow looked so distressed at my state;\\nindeed I believe that his distress was as genuine as mine, and his\\nsentiments as involved. He took my hand again, and his brow wrinkled at\\nits heat. He asked for the other hand to feel my pulse. I had to drop my\\nletter to comply.\\n\\n“I wish to goodness there was something I could do for you,” he said.\\n“Would you--would you care to see a doctor?”\\n\\nI shook my head, and could have smiled at his visible relief.\\n\\n“Then I'm going to prescribe for you,” he said with decision. “It's the\\nplace that doesn't agree with you, and it was I who brought you to the\\nplace; therefore it's for me to get you out of it as quick as possible.\\nUp you get, and I'll drive you to the station myself!”\\n\\nI had another work to keep from smiling: he was so ingenuously\\ndisingenuous. There was less to smile at in his really nervous anxiety\\nto get me away. I lay there reading him like a book: it was not my\\nhealth that concerned him, of course: was it my safety? I told him he\\nlittle knew how ill I was--an inglorious speech that came hard, though\\nnot by any means untrue. “Move me with this fever on me?” said I; “it\\nwould be as much as my miserable life is worth.”\\n\\n“I'm afraid,” said he, “that it may be as much as your life's worth to\\nstay on here!” And there was such real fear, in his voice and eyes,\\nthat it reconciled me there and then to the discomfort of a big revolver\\nbetween the mattress and the small of my back. “We must get you out\\nof it,” he continued, “the moment you feel fit to stir. Shall we say\\nto-morrow?”\\n\\n“If you like,” I said, advisedly; “and if I can get some sleep to-day.”\\n\\n“Then to-morrow it is! You see I know it's the climate,” he added,\\njumping from tone to tone; “it couldn't have been those two or three\\nglasses of sound wine.”\\n\\n“Shall I tell you what it is?” I said, looking him full in the face,\\nwith eyes that I dare say were wild enough with fever and insomnia.\\n“It's the burning of the Lady Jermyn!” I cried. “It's the faces and the\\nshrieks of the women; it's the cursing and the fighting of the men; it's\\nboat-loads struggling in an oily sea; it's husbands and wives jumping\\noverboard together; it's men turned into devils, it's hell-fire\\nafloat--”\\n\\n“Stop! stop!” he whispered, hoarse as a crow. I was sitting up with my\\nhot eyes upon him. He was white as the quilt, and the bed shook with his\\ntrembling. I had gone as far as was prudent, and I lay back with a glow\\nof secret satisfaction.\\n\\n“Yes, I will stop,” said I, “and I wouldn't have begun if you hadn't\\nfound it so difficult to understand my trouble. Now you know what it\\nis. It's the old trouble. I came up here to forget it; instead of that\\nI drink too much and tell you all about it; and the two things together\\nhave bowled me over. But I'll go to-morrow; only give me something to\\nput me asleep till then.”\\n\\n“I will!” he vowed. “I'll go myself to the nearest chemist, and he shall\\ngive me the very strongest stuff he's got. Good-by, and don't you stir\\ntill I come back--for your own sake. I'll go this minute, and I'll ride\\nlike hell!” And if ever two men were glad to be rid of each other, they\\nwere this young villain and myself.\\n\\nBut what was his villany? It was little enough that I had overheard\\nat the window, and still less that poor Eva had told me in her hurried\\nlines. All I saw clearly was that the Lady Jermyn and some hundred souls\\nhad perished by the foulest of foul play; that, besides Eva and myself,\\nonly the incendiaries had escaped; that somehow these wretches had made\\na second escape from the gig, leaving dead men and word of their own\\ndeath behind them in the boat. And here the motive was as much a mystery\\nto me as the means; but, in my present state, both were also matters\\nof supreme indifference. My one desire was to rescue my love from her\\nloathsome captors; of little else did I pause to think. Yet Rattray's\\nvisit left its own mark on my mind; and long after he was gone I lay\\npuzzling over the connection between a young Lancastrian, of good\\nname, of ancient property, of great personal charm, and a crime of\\nunparalleled atrocity committed in cold blood on the high seas. That\\nhis complicity was flagrant I had no room to doubt, after Eva's own\\nindictment of him, uttered to his face and in my hearing. Was it then\\nthe usual fraud on the underwriters, and was Rattray the inevitable\\naccomplice on dry land? I could think of none but the conventional\\nmotive for destroying a vessel. Yet I knew there must be another and a\\nsubtler one, to account not only for the magnitude of the crime, but for\\nthe pains which the actual perpetrators had taken to conceal the fact\\nof their survival, and for the union of so diverse a trinity as Senhor\\nSantos, Captain Harris, and the young squire.\\n\\nIt must have been about mid-day when Rattray reappeared, ruddy, spurred,\\nand splashed with mud; a comfort to sick eyes, I declare, in spite\\nof all. He brought me two little vials, put one on the chimney-piece,\\npoured the other into my tumbler, and added a little water.\\n\\n“There, old fellow,” said he; “swallow that, and if you don't get some\\nsleep the chemist who made it up is the greatest liar unhung.”\\n\\n“What is it?' I asked, the glass in my hand, and my eyes on those of my\\ncompanion.\\n\\n“I don't know,” said he. “I just told them to make up the strongest\\nsleeping-draught that was safe, and I mentioned something about your\\ncase. Toss it off, man; it's sure to be all right.”\\n\\nYes, I could trust him; he was not that sort of villain, for all that\\nEva Denison had said. I liked his face as well as ever. I liked his eye,\\nand could have sworn to its honesty as I drained the glass. Even had it\\nbeen otherwise, I must have taken my chance or shown him all; as it was,\\nwhen he had pulled down my blind, and shaken my pillow, and he gave\\nme his hand once more, I took it with involuntary cordiality. I only\\ngrieved that so fine a young fellow should have involved himself in so\\nvillainous a business; yet for Eva's sake I was glad that he had; for\\nmy mind failed (rather than refused) to believe him so black as she had\\npainted him.\\n\\nThe long, long afternoon that followed I never shall forget. The opiate\\nracked my head; it did not do its work; and I longed to sleep till\\nevening with a longing I have never known before or since. Everything\\nseemed to depend upon it; I should be a man again, if only I could\\nfirst be a log for a few hours. But no; my troubles never left me for an\\ninstant; and there I must lie, pretending that they had! For the other\\ndraught was for the night; and if they but thought the first one had\\ntaken due effect, so much the less would they trouble their heads about\\nme when they believed that I had swallowed the second.\\n\\nOh, but it was cruel! I lay and wept with weakness and want of sleep;\\nere night fell I knew that it would find me useless, if indeed my reason\\nlingered on. To lie there helpless when Eva was expecting me, that would\\nbe the finishing touch. I should rise a maniac if ever I rose at\\nall. More probably I would put one of my five big bullets into my own\\nsplitting head; it was no small temptation, lying there in a double\\nagony, with the loaded weapon by my side.\\n\\nThen sometimes I thought it was coming; and perhaps for an instant would\\nbe tossing in my hen-coop; then back once more. And I swear that\\nmy physical and mental torments, here in my bed, would have been\\nincomparably greater than anything I had endured on the sea, but for the\\nsaving grace of one sweet thought. She lived! She lived! And the God who\\nhad taken care o me, a castaway, would surely deliver her also from\\nthe hands of murderers and thieves. But not through me--I lay weak and\\nhelpless--and my tears ran again and yet again as I felt myself growing\\nhourly weaker.\\n\\nI remember what a bright fine day it was, with the grand open country\\nall smiles beneath a clear, almost frosty sky, once when I got up on\\ntip-toe and peeped out. A keen wind whistled about the cottage; I felt\\nit on my feet as I stood; but never have I known a more perfect and\\ninvigorating autumn day. And there I must lie, with the manhood ebbing\\nOut of me, the manhood that I needed so for the night! I crept back into\\nbed. I swore that I would sleep. Yet there I lay, listening sometimes to\\nthat vile woman's tread below; sometimes to mysterious whispers, between\\nwhom I neither knew nor cared; anon to my watch ticking by my side, to\\nthe heart beating in my body, hour after hour--hour after hour. I prayed\\nas I have seldom prayed. I wept as I have never wept. I railed and\\nblasphemed--not with my lips, because the woman must think I was\\nasleep--but so much the more viciously in my heart.\\n\\nSuddenly it turned dark. There were no gradations--not even a tropical\\ntwilight. One minute I aw the sun upon the blind; the next--thank God!\\nOh, thank God! No light broke any longer through the blind; just a faint\\nand narrow glimmer stole between it and the casement; and the light that\\nhad been bright golden was palest silver now.\\n\\nIt was the moon. I had been in dreamless sleep for hours.\\n\\nThe joy of that discovery! The transport of waking to it, and waking\\nrefreshed! The swift and sudden miracle that it seemed! I shall never,\\nnever forget it, still less the sickening thrill of fear which was\\ncruelly quick to follow upon my joy. The cottage was still as the tomb.\\nWhat if I had slept too long!\\n\\nWith trembling hand I found my watch.\\n\\nLuckily I had wound it in the early morning. I now carried it to the\\nwindow, drew back the blind, and held it in the moonlight. It was not\\nquite ten o'clock. And yet the cottage was so still--so still.\\n\\nI stole to the door, opened it by cautious degrees, and saw the\\nreflection of a light below. Still not a sound could I hear, save the\\nrapid drawing of my own breath, and the startled beating of my own\\nheart.\\n\\nI now felt certain that the Braithwaites were out, and dressed hastily,\\nmaking as little noise as possible, and still hearing absolutely none\\nfrom below. Then, feeling faint with hunger, though a new being after my\\nsleep, I remembered a packet of sandwiches which I had not opened on my\\njourney north. These I transferred from my travelling-bag (where they\\nhad lain forgotten to my jacket pocket), before drawing down the blind,\\nleaving the room on tip-toe, and very gently fastening the door behind\\nme. On the stairs, too, I trod with the utmost caution, feeling the wall\\nwith my left hand (my right was full), lest by any chance I might\\nbe mistaken in supposing I had the cottage to myself. In spite of my\\ncaution there came a creak at every step. And to my sudden horror I\\nheard a chair move in the kitchen below.\\n\\nMy heart and I stood still together. But my right hand tightened on\\nstout wood, my right forefinger trembled against thin steel. The sound\\nwas not repeated. And at length I continued on my way down, my teeth\\nset, an excuse on my lips, but determination in every fibre of my frame.\\n\\nA shadow lay across the kitchen floor; it was that of the deaf mute, as\\nhe stood on a chair before the fire, supporting himself on the chimney\\npiece with one puny arm, while he reached overhead with the other. I\\nstood by for an instant, glorying in the thought that he could not hear\\nme; the next, I saw what it was he was reaching up for--a bell-mouthed\\nblunderbuss--and I knew the little devil for the impostor that he was.\\n\\n“You touch it,” said I, “and you'll drop dead on that hearth.”\\n\\nHe pretended not to hear me, but he heard the click of the splendid\\nspring which Messrs. Deane and Adams had put into that early revolver of\\ntheirs, and he could not have come down much quicker with my bullet in\\nhis spine.\\n\\n“Now, then,” I said, “what the devil do you mean by shamming deaf and\\ndumb?”\\n\\n“I niver said I was owt o' t' sort,” he whimpered, cowering behind the\\nchair in a sullen ague.\\n\\n“But you acted it, and I've a jolly good mind to shoot you dead!”\\n (Remember, I was so weak myself that I thought my arm would break from\\npresenting my five chambers and my ten-inch barrel; otherwise I should\\nbe sorry to relate how I bullied that mouse of a man.) “I may let you\\noff,” I continued, “if you answer questions. Where's your wife?”\\n\\n“Eh, she'll be back directly!” said Braithwaite, with some tact; but his\\nlook was too cunning to give the warning weight. “I've a bullet to spare\\nfor her,” said I, cheerfully; “now, then, where is she?”\\n\\n“Gone wi' the oothers, for owt I knaw.”\\n\\n“And where are the others gone?”\\n\\n“Where they allus go, ower to t' say.”\\n\\n“Over to the sea, eh? We're getting on! What takes them there?”\\n\\n“That's more than I can tell you, sir,” said Braithwaite, with so much\\nemphasis and so little reluctance as to convince me that for once at\\nleast he had spoken the truth. There was even a spice of malice in his\\ntone. I began to see possibilities in the little beast.\\n\\n“Well,” I said, “you're a nice lot! I don't know what your game is, and\\ndon't want to. I've had enough of you without that. I'm off to-night.”\\n\\n“Before they get back?” asked Braithwaite, plainly in doubt about his\\nduty, and yet as plainly relieved to learn the extent of my intention.\\n\\n“Certainly,” said I; “why not? I'm not particularly anxious to see your\\nwife again, and you may ask Mr. Rattray from me why the devil he led\\nme to suppose you were deaf and dumb? Or, if you like, you needn't say\\nanything at all about it,” I added, seeing his thin jaw fall; “tell him\\nI never found you out, but just felt well enough to go, and went. When\\ndo you expect them back?”\\n\\n“It won't be yet a bit,” said he.\\n\\n“Good! Now look here. What would you say to these?” And I showed him a\\ncouple of sovereigns: I longed to offer him twenty, but feared to excite\\nhis suspicions. “These are yours if you have a conveyance at the end of\\nthe lane--the lane we came up the night before last--in an hour's time.”\\n\\nHis dull eyes glistened; but a tremor took him from top to toe, and he\\nshook his head.\\n\\n“I'm ill, man!” I cried. “If I stay here I'll die! Mr. Rattray knows\\nthat, and he wanted me to go this morning; he'll be only too thankful to\\nfind me gone.”\\n\\nThis argument appealed to him; indeed, I was proud of it.\\n\\n“But I was to stop an' look after you,” he mumbled; “it'll get me into\\ntrooble, it will that!”\\n\\nI took out three more sovereigns; not a penny higher durst I go.\\n\\n“Will five pounds repay you? No need to tell your wife it was five, you\\nknow! I should keep four of them all to myself.”\\n\\nThe cupidity of the little wretch was at last overcoming his abject\\ncowardice. I could see him making up his miserable mind. And I still\\nflatter myself that I took only safe (and really cunning) steps to\\nprecipitate the process. To offer him more money would have been\\nmadness; instead, I poured it all back into my pocket.\\n\\n“All right!” I cried; “you're a greedy, cowardly, old idiot, and I'll\\njust save my money.” And out I marched into the moonlight, very briskly,\\ntowards the lane; he was so quick to follow me that I had no fears of\\nthe blunderbuss, but quickened my step, and soon had him running at my\\nheels.\\n\\n“Stop, stop, sir! You're that hasty wi' a poor owd man.” So he whimpered\\nas he followed me like the little cur he was.\\n\\n“I'm hanged if I stop,” I answered without looking back; and had him\\nalmost in tears before I swung round on him so suddenly that he yelped\\nwith fear. “What are you bothering me for?” I blustered. “Do you want me\\nto wring your neck?”\\n\\n“Oh, I'll go, sir! I'll go, I'll go,” he moaned.\\n\\n“I've a good mind not to let you. I wouldn't if I was fit to walk five\\nmiles.”\\n\\n“But I'll roon 'em, sir! I will that! I'll go as fast as iver I can!”\\n\\n“And have a conveyance at the road-end of the lane as near an hour hence\\nas you possibly can?”\\n\\n“Why, there, sir!” he cried, crassly inspired; “I could drive you in our\\nown trap in half the time.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, you couldn't! I--I'm not fit to be out at all; it must be a\\nclosed conveyance; but I'll come to the end of the lane to save time,\\nso let him wait there. You needn't wait yourself; here's a sovereign\\nof your money, and I'll leave the rest in the jug in my bedroom. There!\\nIt's worth your while to trust me, I think. As for my luggage, I'll\\nwrite to Mr. Rattray about that. But I'll be shot if I spend another\\nnight on his property.”\\n\\nI was rid of him at last; and there I stood, listening to his headlong\\nsteps, until they stumbled out of earshot down the lane; then back to\\nthe cottage, at a run myself, and up to my room to be no worse than my\\nword. The sovereigns plopped into the water and rang together at\\nthe bottom of the jug. In another minute I was hastening through the\\nplantation, in my hand the revolver that had served me well already, and\\nwas still loaded and capped in all five chambers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV. IN THE GARDEN\\n\\n\\nIt so happened that I met nobody at all; but I must confess that my\\nluck was better than my management. As I came upon the beck, a new sound\\nreached me with the swirl. It was the jingle of bit and bridle; the beat\\nof hoofs came after; and I had barely time to fling myself flat, when\\ntwo horsemen emerged from the plantation, riding straight towards me in\\nthe moonlight. If they continued on that course they could not fail\\nto see me as they passed along the opposite bank. However, to my\\nunspeakable relief, they were scarce clear of the trees when they turned\\ntheir horses' heads, rode them through the water a good seventy yards\\nfrom where I lay, and so away at a canter across country towards the\\nroad. On my hands and knees I had a good look at them as they bobbed up\\nand down under the moon; and my fears subsided in astonished curiosity.\\nFor I have already boasted of my eyesight, and I could have sworn that\\nneither Rattray nor any one of his guests was of the horsemen; yet the\\nback and shoulders of one of these seemed somehow familiar to me. Not\\nthat I wasted many moments over the coincidence, for I had other things\\nto think about as I ran on to the hall.\\n\\nI found the rear of the building in darkness unrelieved from within; on\\nthe other hand, the climbing moon beat so full upon the garden wall, it\\nwas as though a lantern pinned me as I crept beneath it. In passing I\\nthought I might as well try the gate; but Eva was right; it was locked;\\nand that made me half inclined to distrust my eyes in the matter of the\\ntwo horsemen, for whence could they have come, if not from the hall?\\nIn any case I was well rid of them. I now followed the wall some little\\ndistance, and then, to see over it, walked backwards until I was all but\\nin the beck; and there, sure enough, shone my darling's candle, close as\\nclose against the diamond panes of her narrow, lofty window! It brought\\nthose ready tears back to my foolish, fevered eyes. But for sentiment\\nthere was no time, and every other emotion was either futile or\\npremature. So I mastered my full heart, I steeled, my wretched nerves,\\nand braced my limp muscles for the task that lay before them.\\n\\nI had a garden wall to scale, nearly twice my own height, and without\\nnotch or cranny in the ancient, solid masonry. I stood against it on my\\ntoes, and I touched it with my finger-tips as high up as possible. Some\\nfour feet severed them from the coping that left only half a sky above\\nmy upturned eyes.\\n\\nI do not know whether I have made it plain that the house was not\\nsurrounded by four walls, but merely filled a breach in one of the\\nfour, which nipped it (as it were) at either end. The back entrance was\\napproachable enough, but barred or watched, I might be very sure. It is\\never the vulnerable points which are most securely guarded, and it was\\nmy one comfort that the difficult way must also be the safe way, if only\\nthe difficulty could be overcome. How to overcome it was the problem.\\nI followed the wall right round to the point at which it abutted on the\\ntower that immured my love; the height never varied; nor could my hands\\nor eyes discover a single foot-hole, ledge, or other means of mounting\\nto the top.\\n\\nYet my hot head was full of ideas; and I wasted some minutes in trying\\nto lift from its hinges a solid, six-barred, outlying gate, that my\\nweak arms could hardly stir. More time went in pulling branches from the\\noak-trees about the beck, where the latter ran nearest to the moonlit\\nwall. I had an insane dream of throwing a long forked branch over\\nthe coping, and so swarming up hand-over-hand. But even to me the\\nimpracticability of this plan came home at last. And there I stood in a\\nbreathless lather, much time and strength thrown away together; and the\\ncandle burning down for nothing in that little lofty window; and the\\nrunning water swirling noisily over its stones at my back.\\n\\nThis was the only sound; the wind had died away; the moonlit valley\\nlay as still as the dread old house in its midst but for the splash and\\ngurgle of the beck. I fancied this grew louder as I paused and listened\\nin my helplessness. All at once--was it the tongue of Nature telling me\\nthe way, or common gumption returning at the eleventh hour? I ran down\\nto the water's edge, and could have shouted for joy. Great stones lay in\\nequal profusion on bed and banks. I lifted one of the heaviest in both\\nhands. I staggered with it to the wall. I came back for another; for\\nsome twenty minutes I was so employed; my ultimate reward a fine heap of\\nboulders against the wall.\\n\\nThen I began to build; then mounted my pile, clawing the wall to keep\\nmy balance. My fingers were still many inches from the coping. I jumped\\ndown and gave another ten minutes to the back-breaking work of carrying\\nmore boulders from the water to the wall. Then I widened my cairn below,\\nso that I could stand firmly before springing upon the pinnacle with\\nwhich I completed it. I knew well that this would collapse under me if\\nI allowed my weight to rest more than an instant upon it. And so at last\\nit did; but my fingers had clutched the coping in time; had grabbed it\\neven as the insecure pyramid crumbled and left me dangling.\\n\\nInstantly exerting what muscle I had left, and the occasion gave me,\\nI succeeded in pulling myself up until my chin was on a level with my\\nhands, when I flung an arm over and caught the inner coping. The other\\narm followed; then a leg; and at last I sat astride the wall, panting\\nand palpitating, and hardly able to credit my own achievement. One great\\ndifficulty had been my huge revolver. I had been terribly frightened it\\nmight go off, and had finally used my cravat to sling it at the back\\nof my neck. It had shifted a little, and I was working it round again,\\npreparatory to my drop, when I saw the light suddenly taken from the\\nwindow in the tower, and a kerchief waving for one instant in its place.\\nSo she had been waiting and watching for me all these hours! I dropped\\ninto the garden in a very ecstasy of grief and rapture, to think that I\\nhad been so long in coming to my love, but that I had come at last. And\\nI picked myself up in a very frenzy of fear lest, after all, I should\\nfail to spirit her from this horrible place.\\n\\nDoubly desolate it looked in the rays of that bright October moon.\\nSkulking in the shadow of the wall which had so long baffled me, I\\nlooked across a sharp border of shade upon a chaos, the more striking\\nfor its lingering trim design. The long, straight paths were barnacled\\nwith weeds; the dense, fine hedges, once prim and angular, had fattened\\nout of all shape or form; and on the velvet sward of other days you\\nmight have waded waist high in rotten hay. Towards the garden end this\\nrank jungle merged into a worse wilderness of rhododendrons, the tallest\\nI have ever seen. On all this the white moon smiled, and the grim house\\nglowered, to the eternal swirl and rattle of the beck beyond its walls.\\n\\nLong enough I stood where I had dropped, listening with all my being\\nfor some other sound; but at last that great studded door creaked\\nand shivered on its ancient hinges, and I heard voices arguing in the\\nPortuguese tongue. It was poor Eva wheedling that black rascal Jose.\\nI saw her in the lighted porch; the nigger I saw also, shrugging and\\ngesticulating for all the world like his hateful master; yet giving in,\\nI felt certain, though I could not understand a word that reached me.\\n\\nAnd indeed my little mistress very soon sailed calmly out, followed by\\nfinal warnings and expostulations hurled from the step: for the black\\nstood watching her as she came steadily my way, now raising her head to\\nsniff the air, now stooping to pluck up a weed, the very picture of a\\nprisoner seeking the open air for its own sake solely. I had a keen eye\\napiece for them as I cowered closer to the wall, revolver in hand. But\\nere my love was very near me (for she would stand long moments gazing\\never so innocently at the moon), her jailer had held a bottle to the\\nlight, and had beaten a retreat so sudden and so hasty that I expected\\nhim back every moment, and so durst not stir. Eva saw me, however,\\nand contrived to tell me so without interrupting the air that she was\\nhumming as she walked.\\n\\n“Follow me,” she sang, “only keep as you are, keep as you are, close to\\nthe wall, close to the wall.”\\n\\nAnd on she strolled to her own tune, and came abreast of me without\\nturning her head; so I crept in the shadow (my ugly weapon tucked out of\\nsight), and she sauntered in the shine, until we came to the end of\\nthe garden, where the path turned at right angles, running behind the\\nrhododendrons; once in their shelter, she halted and beckoned me, and\\nnext instant I had her hands in mine.\\n\\n“At last!” was all that I could say for many a moment, as I stood there\\ngazing into her dear eyes, no hero in my heroic hour, but the bigger\\nlove-sick fool than ever. “But quick--quick--quick!” I added, as she\\nbrought me to my senses by withdrawing her hands. “We've no time to\\nlose.” And I looked wildly from wall to wall, only to find them as\\nbarren and inaccessible on this side as on the other.\\n\\n“We have more time than you think,” were Eva's first words. “We can do\\nnothing for half-an-hour.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“I'll tell you in a minute. How did you manage to get over?”\\n\\n“Brought boulders from the beck, and piled 'em up till I could reach the\\ntop.”\\n\\nI thought her eyes glistened.\\n\\n“What patience!” she cried softly. “We must find a simpler way of\\ngetting out--and I think I have. They've all gone, you know, but Jose.”\\n\\n“All three?”\\n\\n“The captain has been gone all day.”\\n\\nThen the other two must have been my horse-men, very probably in some\\ndisguise; and my head swam with the thought of the risk that I had run\\nat the very moment when I thought myself safest. Well, I would have\\nfinished them both! But I did not say so to Eva. I did not mention\\nthe incident, I was so fearful of destroying her confidence in me.\\nApologizing, therefore, for my interruption, without explaining it, I\\nbegged her to let me hear her plan.\\n\\nIt was simple enough. There was no fear of the others returning before\\nmidnight; the chances were that they would be very much later; and\\nnow it was barely eleven, and Eva had promised not to stay out above\\nhalf-an-hour. When it was up Jose would come and call her.\\n\\n“It is horrid to have to be so cunning!” cried little Eva, with an angry\\nshudder; “but it's no use thinking of that,” she was quick enough to\\nadd, “when you have such dreadful men to deal with, such fiends! And I\\nhave had all day to prepare, and have suffered till I am so desperate I\\nwould rather die to-night than spend another in that house. No; let me\\nfinish! Jose will come round here to look for me. But you and I will\\nbe hiding on the other side of these rhododendrons. And when we hear him\\nhere we'll make a dash for it across the long grass. Once let us get the\\ndoor shut and locked in his face, and he'll be in a trap. It will take\\nhim some time to break in; time enough to give us a start; what's more,\\nwhen he finds us gone, he'll do what they all used to do in any doubt.”\\n\\n“What's that?”\\n\\n“Say nothing till it's found out; then lie for their lives; and it was\\ntheir lives, poor creatures on the Zambesi!” She was silent a moment,\\nher determined little face hard--set upon some unforgotten horror.\\n“Once we get away, I shall be surprised if it's found out till morning,”\\n concluded Eva, without a word as to what I was to do with her; neither,\\nindeed, had I myself given that question a moment's consideration.\\n\\n“Then let's make a dash for it now!” was all I said or thought.\\n\\n“No; they can't come yet, and Jose is strong and brutal, and I\\nhave heard how ill you are. That you should have come to me\\nnotwithstanding--” and she broke off with her little hands lying\\nso gratefully on my shoulders, that I know not how I refrained from\\ncatching her then and there to my heart. Instead, I laughed and said\\nthat my illness was a pure and deliberate sharp, and my presence there\\nits direct result. And such was the virtue in my beloved's voice, the\\nmagic of her eyes, the healing of her touch, that I was scarce conscious\\nof deceit, but felt a whole man once more as we two stood together in\\nthe moonlight.\\n\\nIn a trance I stood there gazing into her brave young eyes. In a\\ntrance I suffered her to lead me by the hand through the rank, dense\\nrhododendrons. And still entranced I crouched by her side near the\\nfurther side, with only unkempt grass-plot and a weedy path between us\\nand that ponderous door, wide open still, and replaced by a section of\\nthe lighted hail within. On this we fixed our attention with mingled\\ndread and impatience, those contending elements of suspense; but the\\nblack was slow to reappear; and my eyes stole home to my sweet girl's\\nface, with its glory of moonlit curls, and the eager, resolute,\\nembittered look that put the world back two whole months, and Eva\\nDenison upon the Lady Jermyn's poop, in the ship's last hours. But it\\nwas not her look alone; she had on her cloak, as the night before,\\nbut with me (God bless her!) she found no need to clasp herself in its\\nfolds; and underneath she wore the very dress in which she had sung at\\nour last concert, and been rescued in the gig. It looked as though she\\nhad worn it ever since. The roses were crushed and soiled, the tulle all\\ntorn, and tarnished some strings of beads that had been gold: a tatter\\nof Chantilly lace hung by a thread: it is another of the relics that I\\nhave unearthed in the writing of this narrative.\\n\\n“I thought men never noticed dresses?” my love said suddenly, a pleased\\nlight in her eyes (I thought) in spite of all. “Do you really remember\\nit?”\\n\\n“I remember every one of them,” I said indignantly; and so I did.\\n\\n“You will wonder why I wear it,” said Eva, quickly. “It was the first\\nthat came that terrible night. They have given me many since. But I\\nwon't wear one of them--not one!”\\n\\nHow her eyes flashed! I forgot all about Jose.\\n\\n“I suppose you know why they hadn't room for you in the gig?” she went\\non.\\n\\n“No, I don't know, and I don't care. They had room for you,” said I;\\n“that's all I care about.” And to think she could not see I loved her!\\n\\n“But do you mean to say you don't know that these--murderers--set fire\\nto the ship?”\\n\\n“No--yes! I heard you say so last night.”\\n\\n“And you don't want to know what for?”\\n\\nOut of politeness I protested that I did; but, as I live, all I wanted\\nto know just then was whether my love loved me--whether she ever\\ncould--whether such happiness was possible under heaven!\\n\\n“You remember all that mystery about the cargo?” she continued eagerly,\\nher pretty lips so divinely parted!\\n\\n“It turned out to be gunpowder,” said I, still thinking only of her.\\n\\n“No--gold!”\\n\\n“But it was gunpowder,” I insisted; for it was my incorrigible passion\\nfor accuracy which had led up to half our arguments on the voyage; but\\nthis time Eva let me off.\\n\\n“It was also gold: twelve thousand ounces from the diggings. That was\\nthe real mystery. Do you mean to say you never guessed?”\\n\\n“No, by Jove I didn't!” said I. She had diverted my interest at last. I\\nasked her if she had known on board.\\n\\n“Not until the last moment. I found out during the fire. Do you remember\\nwhen we said good-by? I was nearly telling you then.”\\n\\nDid I remember! The very letter of that last interview was cut deep in\\nmy heart; not a sleepless night had I passed without rehearsing it word\\nfor word and look for look; and sometimes, when sorrow had spent itself,\\nand the heart could bleed no more, vain grief had given place to vainer\\nspeculation, and I had cudgelled my wakeful brains for the meaning of\\nthe new and subtle horror which I had read in my darling's eyes at the\\nlast. Now I understood; and the one explanation brought such a tribe\\nin its train, that even the perilous ecstasy of the present moment was\\ntemporarily forgotten in the horrible past.\\n\\n“Now I know why they wouldn't have me in the gig!” I cried softly.\\n\\n“She carried four heavy men's weight in gold.”\\n\\n“When on earth did they get it aboard?”\\n\\n“In provision boxes at the last; but they had been filling the boxes for\\nweeks.”\\n\\n“Why, I saw them doing it!” I cried. “But what about the gig? Who picked\\nyou up?”\\n\\nShe was watching that open door once more, and she answered with notable\\nindifference, “Mr. Rattray.”\\n\\n“So that's the connection!” said I; and I think its very simplicity was\\nwhat surprised me most.\\n\\n“Yes; he was waiting for us at Ascension.”\\n\\n“Then it was all arranged?”\\n\\n“Every detail.”\\n\\n“And this young blackguard is as bad as any of them!”\\n\\n“Worse,” said she, with bitter brevity. Nor had I ever seen her look so\\nhard but once, and that was the night before in the old justice hall,\\nwhen she told Rattray her opinion of him to his face. She had now the\\nsame angry flush, the same set mouth and scornful voice; and I took\\nit finally into my head that she was unjust to the poor devil, villain\\nthough he was. With all his villainy I declined to believe him as bad\\nas the others. I told her so in as many words. And in a moment we were\\narguing as though we were back on the Lady Jermyn with nothing else to\\ndo.\\n\\n“You may admire wholesale murderers and thieves,” said Eva. “I do not.”\\n\\n“Nor I. My point is simply that this one is not as bad as the rest. I\\nbelieve he was really glad for my sake when he discovered that I knew\\nnothing of the villainy. Come now, has he ever offered you any personal\\nviolence?”\\n\\n“Me? Mr. Rattray? I should hope not, indeed!”\\n\\n“Has he never saved you from any?”\\n\\n“I--I don't know.”\\n\\n“Then I do. When you left them last night there was some talk of\\nbringing you back by force. You can guess who suggested that--and who\\nset his face against it and got his way. You would think the better of\\nRattray had you heard what passed.”\\n\\n“Should I?” she asked half eagerly, as she looked quickly round at me;\\nand suddenly I saw her eyes fill. “Oh, why will you speak about him?”\\n she burst out. “Why must you defend him, unless it's to go against me,\\nas you always did and always will! I never knew anybody like you--never!\\nI want you to take me away from these wretches, and all you do is to\\ndefend them!”\\n\\n“Not all,” said I, clasping her hand warmly in mine. “Not all--not all!\\nI will take you away from them, never fear; in another hour God grant\\nyou may be out of their reach for ever!”\\n\\n“But where are we to go?” she whispered wildly. “What are you to do with\\nme? All my friends think me dead, and if they knew I was not it would\\nall come out.”\\n\\n“So it shall,” said I; “the sooner the better; if I'd had my way it\\nwould all be out already.”\\n\\nI see her yet, my passionate darling, as she turned upon me, whiter than\\nthe full white moon.\\n\\n“Mr. Cole,” said she, “you must give me your sacred promise that so far\\nas you are concerned, it shall never come out at all!”\\n\\n“This monstrous conspiracy? This cold blooded massacre?”\\n\\nAnd I crouched aghast.\\n\\n“Yes; it could do no good; and, at any rate, unless you promise I remain\\nwhere I am.”\\n\\n“In their hands?”\\n\\n“Decidedly--to warn them in time. Leave them I would, but betray\\nthem--never!”\\n\\nWhat could I say? What choice had I in the face of an alternative so\\nheadstrong and so unreasonable? To rescue Eva from these miscreants I\\nwould have let every malefactor in the country go unscathed: yet the\\ncondition was a hard one; and, as I hesitated, my love went on her knees\\nto me, there in the moonlight among the rhododendrons.\\n\\n“Promise--promise--or you will kill me!” she gasped. “They may deserve\\nit richly, but I would rather be torn in little pieces than--than have\\nthem--hanged!”\\n\\n“It is too good for most of them.”\\n\\n“Promise!”\\n\\n“To hold my tongue about them all?”\\n\\n“Yes--promise!”\\n\\n“Promise!”\\n\\n“When a hundred lives were sacrificed--”\\n\\n“Promise!”\\n\\n“I can't,” I said. “It's wrong.”\\n\\n“Then good-by!” she cried, starting to her feet.\\n\\n“No--no--” and I caught her hand.\\n\\n“Well, then?”\\n\\n“I--promise.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV. FIRST BLOOD\\n\\n\\nSo I bound myself to a guilty secrecy for Eva's sake, to save her from\\nthese wretches, or if you will, to win her for myself. Nor did it\\nstrike me as very strange, after a moment's reflection, that she should\\nintercede thus earnestly for a band headed by her own mother's widower,\\nprime scoundrel of them all though she knew him to be. The only\\nsurprise was that she had not interceded in his name; that I should have\\nforgotten, and she should have allowed me to forget, the very existence\\nof so indisputable a claim upon her loyalty. This, however, made it a\\nlittle difficult to understand the hysterical gratitude with which my\\nunwilling promise was received. Poor darling! she was beside herself\\nwith sheer relief. She wept as I had never seen her weep before. She\\nseized and even kissed my hands, as one who neither knew nor cared what\\nshe did, surprising me so much by her emotion that this expression of it\\npassed unheeded. I was the best friend she had ever had. I was her one\\ngood friend in all the world; she would trust herself to me; and if I\\nwould but take her to the convent where she had been brought up, she\\nwould pray for me there until her death, but that would not be very\\nlong.\\n\\nAll of which confused me utterly; it seemed an inexplicable breakdown\\nin one who had shown such nerve and courage hitherto, and so hearty a\\nloathing for that damnable Santos. So completely had her presence of\\nmind forsaken her that she looked no longer where she had been gazing\\nhitherto. And thus it was that neither of us saw Jose until we heard\\nhim calling, “Senhora Evah! Senhora Evah!” with some rapid sentences in\\nPortuguese.\\n\\n“Now is our time,” I whispered, crouching lower and clasping a small\\nhand gone suddenly cold. “Think of nothing now but getting out of this.\\nI'll keep my word once we are out; and here's the toy that's going to\\nget us out.” And I produced my Deane and Adams with no small relish.\\n\\nA little trustful pressure was my answer and my reward; meanwhile the\\nblack was singing out lustily in evident suspicion and alarm.\\n\\n“He says they are coming back,” whispered Eva; “but that's impossible.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because if they were he couldn't see them, and if he heard them he\\nwould be frightened of their hearing him. But here he comes!”\\n\\nA shuffling quick step on the path; a running grumble of unmistakable\\nthreats; a shambling moonlit figure seen in glimpses through the leaves,\\nvery near us for an instant, then hidden by the shrubbery as he passed\\nwithin a few yards of our hiding-place. A diminuendo of the\\nshuffling steps; then a cursing, frightened savage at one end of the\\nrhododendrons, and we two stealing out at the other, hand in hand, and\\nbent quite double, into the long neglected grass.\\n\\n“Can you run for it?” I whispered.\\n\\n“Yes, but not too fast, for fear we trip.'\\n\\n“Come on, then!”\\n\\nThe lighted open doorway grew greater at every stride.\\n\\n“He hasn't seen us yet--”\\n\\n“No, I hear him threatening me still.”\\n\\n“Now he has, though!”\\n\\nA wild whoop proclaimed the fact, and upright we tore at top speed\\nthrough the last ten yards of grass, while the black rushed down one of\\nthe side paths, gaining audibly on us over the better ground. But our\\nstart had saved us, and we flew up the steps as his feet ceased to\\nclatter on the path; he had plunged into the grass to cut off the\\ncorner.\\n\\n“Thank God!” cried Eva. “Now shut it quick.”\\n\\nThe great door swung home with a mighty clatter, and Eva seized the key\\nin both hands.\\n\\n“I can't turn it!”\\n\\nTo lose a second was to take a life, and unconsciously I was sticking\\nat that, perhaps from no higher instinct than distrust of my aim. Our\\npursuer, however, was on the steps when I clapped my free hand on top of\\nthose little white straining ones, and by a timely effort bent both them\\nand the key round together; the ward shot home as Jose hurled himself\\nagainst the door. Eva bolted it. But the thud was not repeated, and I\\ngathered myself together between the door and the nearest window, for by\\nnow I saw there was but one thing for us. The nigger must be disabled,\\nif I could manage such a nicety; if not, the devil take his own.\\n\\nWell, I was not one tick too soon for him. My pistol was not cocked\\nbefore the crash came that I was counting on, and with it a shower of\\nsmall glass driving across the six-foot sill and tinkling on the flags.\\nNext came a black and bloody face, at which I could not fire. I had\\nto wait till I saw his legs, when I promptly shattered one of them at\\ndisgracefully short range. The report was as deafening as one upon the\\nstage; the hall filled with white smoke, and remained hideous with the\\nbellowing of my victim. I searched him without a qualm, but threats\\nof annihilation instead, and found him unarmed but for that very knife\\nwhich Rattray had induced me to hand over to him in town. I had a grim\\nsatisfaction in depriving him of this, and but small compunction in\\nturning my back upon his pain.\\n\\n“Come,” I said to poor Eva, “don't pity him, though I daresay he's the\\nmost pitiable of the lot; show me the way through, and I'll follow with\\nthis lamp.”\\n\\nOne was burning on the old oak table. I carried it along a narrow\\npassage, through a great low kitchen where I bumped my head against the\\nblack oak beams; and I held it on high at a door almost as massive as\\nthe one which we had succeeded in shutting in the nigger's face.\\n\\n“I was afraid of it!” cried Eva, with a sudden sob.\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“They've taken away the key!”\\n\\nYes, the keen air came through an empty keyhole; and my lamp, held\\nclose, not only showed that the door was locked, but that the lock was\\none with which an unskilled hand might tamper for hours without result.\\nI dealt it a hearty kick by way of a test. The heavy timber did not\\nbudge; there was no play at all at either lock or hinges; nor did I see\\nhow I could spend one of my four remaining bullets upon the former, with\\nany chance of a return.\\n\\n“Is this the only other door?”\\n\\n“Then it must be a window.”\\n\\n“All the back ones are barred.”\\n\\n“Securely?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Then we've no choice in the matter.”\\n\\nAnd I led the way back to the hall, where the poor black devil lay\\nblubbering in his blood. In the kitchen I found the bottle of wine\\n(Rattray's best port, that they were trying to make her take for her\\nhealth) with which Eva had bribed him, and I gave it to him before\\nlaying hands on a couple of chairs.\\n\\n“What are you going to do?”'\\n\\n“Go out the way we came.”\\n\\n“But the wall?”\\n\\n“Pile up these chairs, and as many more as we may need, if we can't open\\nthe gate.”\\n\\nBut Eva was not paying attention any longer, either to me or to Jose;\\nhis white teeth were showing in a grin for all his pain; her eyes were\\nfixed in horror on the floor.\\n\\n“They've come back,” she gasped. “The underground passage! Hark--hark!”\\n\\nThere was a muffled rush of feet beneath our own, then a dull but very\\ndistinguishable clatter on some invisible stair.\\n\\n“Underground passage!” I exclaimed, and in my sheer disgust I forgot\\nwhat was due to my darling. “Why on earth didn't you tell me of it\\nbefore?”\\n\\n“There was so much to tell you! It leads to the sea. Oh, what shall we\\ndo? You must hide--upstairs--anywhere!” cried Eva, wildly. “Leave them\\nto me--leave them to me.”\\n\\n“I like that,” said I; and I did; but I detested myself for the tears my\\nwords had drawn, and I prepared to die for them.\\n\\n“They'll kill you, Mr. Cole!”\\n\\n“It would serve me right; but we'll see about it.”\\n\\nAnd I stood with my revolver very ready in my right hand, while with\\nthe other I caught poor Eva to my side, even as a door flew open,\\nand Rattray himself burst upon us, a lantern in his hand, and the\\nperspiration shining on his handsome face in its light.\\n\\nI can see him now as he stood dumfounded on the threshold of the hall;\\nand yet, at the time, my eyes sped past him into the room beyond.\\n\\nIt was the one I have described as being lined with books; there was\\na long rent in this lining, where the books had opened with a door,\\nthrough which Captain Harris, Joaquin Santos, and Jane Braithwaite\\nfollowed Rattray in quick succession, the men all with lanterns, the\\nwoman scarlet and dishevelled even for her. It was over the squire's\\nshoulders I saw their faces; he kept them from passing him in the\\ndoorway by a free use of his elbows; and when I looked at him again, his\\nblack eyes were blazing from a face white with passion, and they were\\nfixed upon me.\\n\\n“What the devil brings you here?” he thundered at last.\\n\\n“Don't ask idle questions,” was my reply to that.\\n\\n“So you were shamming to-day!”\\n\\n“I was taking a leaf out of your book.”\\n\\n“You'll gain nothing by being clever!” sneered the squire, taking\\na threatening step forward. For at the last moment I had tucked my\\nrevolver behind my back, not only for the pleasure, but for the obvious\\nadvantage of getting them all in front of me and off their guard. I\\nhad no idea that such eyes as Rattray's could be so fierce: they were\\ndancing from me to my companion, whom their glitter frightened into an\\nattempt to disengage herself from me; but my arm only tightened about\\nher drooping figure.\\n\\n“I shall gain no more than I expect,” said I, carelessly. “And I know\\nwhat to expect from brave gentlemen like you! It will be better than\\nyour own fate, at all events; anything's better than being taken hence\\nto the place of execution, and hanged by the neck until you're dead, all\\nthree of you in a row, and your bodies buried within the precincts of\\nthe prison!”\\n\\n“The very thing for him,” murmured Santos. “The--very--theeng!”\\n\\n“But I'm so soft-hearted,” I went insanely on, “that I should be sorry\\nto see that happen to such fine fellows as you are. Come out of that,\\nyou little fraud behind there!” It was my betrayer skulking in the\\nroom. “Come out and line up with the rest! No, I'm not going to see you\\nfellows dance on nothing; I've another kind of ball apiece for you, and\\none between 'em for the Braithwaites!”\\n\\nWell, I suppose I always had a nasty tongue in me, and rather enjoyed\\nmaking play with it on provocation; but, if so, I met with my deserts\\nthat night. For the nigger of the Lady Jermyn lay all but hid behind Eva\\nand me; if they saw him at all, they may have thought him drunk; but, as\\nfor myself, I had fairly forgotten his existence until the very moment\\ncame for showing my revolver, when it was twisted out of my grasp\\ninstead, and a ball sang under my arm as the brute fell back exhausted\\nand the weapon clattered beside him. Before I could stoop for it there\\nwas a dead weight on my left arm, and Squire Rattray was over the table\\nat a bound, with his arms jostling mine beneath Eva Denison's senseless\\nform.\\n\\n“Leave her to me,” he cried fiercely. “You fool,” he added in a lower\\nkey, “do you think I'd let any harm come to her?”\\n\\nI looked him in the bright and honest eyes that had made me trust him\\nin the beginning. And I did not utterly distrust him yet. Rather was the\\nguile on my side as I drew back and watched Rattray lift the young girl\\ntenderly, and slowly carry her to the door by which she had entered and\\nleft the hall just twenty-four hours before. I could not take my eyes\\noff them till they were gone. And when I looked for my revolver, it also\\nhad disappeared.\\n\\nJose had not got it--he lay insensible. Santos was whispering to Harris.\\nNeither of them seemed armed. I made sure that Rattray had picked it up\\nand carried it off with Eva. I looked wildly for some other weapon. Two\\nunarmed men and a woman were all I had to deal with, for Braithwaite\\nhad long since vanished. Could I but knock the worthless life out of the\\nmen, I should have but the squire and his servants to deal with; and in\\nthat quarter I still had my hopes of a bloodless battle and a treaty of\\nwar.\\n\\nA log fire was smouldering in the open grate. I darted to it, and had a\\nheavy, half-burned brand whirling round my head next instant. Harris was\\nthe first within my reach. He came gamely at me with his fists. I sprang\\nupon him, and struck him to the ground with one blow, the sparks flying\\nfar and wide as my smoking brand met the seaman's skull. Santos was upon\\nme next instant, and him, by sheer luck, I managed to serve the same;\\nbut I doubt whether either man was stunned; and I was standing ready for\\nthem to rise, when I felt myself seized round the neck from behind, and\\na mass of fluffy hair tickling my cheek, while a shrill voice set up a\\nlusty scream for the squire.\\n\\nI have said that the woman Braithwaite was of a sinister strength; but I\\nhad little dreamt how strong she really was. First it was her arms\\nthat wound themselves about my neck, long, sinuous, and supple as the\\ntentacles of some vile monster; then, as I struggled, her thumbs were on\\nmy windpipe like pads of steel. Tighter she pressed, and tighter yet. My\\neyeballs started; my tongue lolled; I heard my brand drop, and through\\na mist I saw it picked up instantly. It crashed upon my skull as I still\\nstruggled vainly; again and again it came down mercilessly in the same\\nplace; until I felt as though a sponge of warm water had been squeezed\\nover my head, and saw a hundred withered masks grinning sudden\\nexultation into mine; but still the lean arm whirled, and the splinters\\nflew, till I was blind with my blood and the seven senses were beaten\\nout of me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI. A DEADLOCK\\n\\n\\nIt must have been midnight when I opened my eyes; a clock was striking\\nas though it never would stop. My mouth seemed fire; a pungent flavor\\nfilled my nostrils; the wineglass felt cold against my teeth. “That's\\nmore like it!” muttered a voice close to my ear. An arm was withdrawn\\nfrom under my shoulders. I was allowed to sink back upon some pillows.\\nAnd now I saw where I was. The room was large and poorly lighted. I lay\\nin my clothes on an old four-poster bed. And my enemies were standing\\nover me in a group.\\n\\n“I hope you are satisfied!” sneered Joaquin Santos, with a flourish of\\nhis eternal cigarette.\\n\\n“I am. You don't do murder in my house, wherever else you may do it.”\\n\\n“And now better lid 'im to the nirrest polissstation; or weel you go\\nand tell the poliss yourself?” asked the Portuguese, in the same tone of\\nmordant irony.\\n\\n“Ay, ay,” growled Harris; “that's the next thing!”\\n\\n“No,” said Rattray; “the next thing's for you two to leave him to me.”\\n\\n“We'll see you damned!” cried the captain.\\n\\n“No, no, my friend,” said Santos, with a shrug; “let him have his way.\\nHe is as fond of his skeen as you are of yours; he'll come round to our\\nway in the end. I know this Senhor Cole. It is necessary for 'im to die.\\nBut it is not necessary this moment; let us live them together for a\\nleetle beet.”\\n\\n“That's all I ask,” said Rattray.\\n\\n“You won't ask it twice,” rejoined Santos, shrugging. “I know this\\nSenhor Cole. There is only one way of dilling with a man like that.\\nBesides, he 'as 'alf-keeled my good Jose; it is necessary for 'im to\\ndie.”\\n\\n“I agree with the senhor,” said Harris, whose forehead was starred\\nwith sticking-plaster. “It's him or us, an' we're all agen you, squire.\\nYou'll have to give in, first or last.”\\n\\nAnd the pair were gone; their steps grew faint in the corridor; when we\\ncould no longer hear them, Rattray closed the door and quietly locked\\nit. Then he turned to me, stern enough, and pointed to the door with a\\nhand that shook.\\n\\n“You see how it is?”\\n\\n“Perfectly.”\\n\\n“They want to kill you!”\\n\\n“Of course they do.”\\n\\n“It's your own fault; you've run yourself into this. I did my best to\\nkeep you out of it. But in you come, and spill first blood.”\\n\\n“I don't regret it,” said I.\\n\\n“Oh, you're damned mule enough not to regret anything!” cried Rattray.\\n“I see the sort you are; yet but for me, I tell you plainly, you'd be a\\ndead man now.”\\n\\n“I can't think why you interfered.”\\n\\n“You've heard the reason. I won't have murder done here if I can prevent\\nit; so far I have; it rests with you whether I can go on preventing it\\nor not.”\\n\\n“With me, does it?”\\n\\nHe sat down on the side of the bed. He threw an arm to the far side of\\nmy body, and he leaned over me with savage eyes now staring into mine,\\nnow resting with a momentary gleam of pride upon my battered head. I put\\nup my hand; it lit upon a very turban of bandages, and at that I tried\\nto take his hand in mine. He shook it off, and his eyes met mine more\\nfiercely than before.\\n\\n“See here, Cole,” said he; “I don t know how the devil you got wind of\\nanything to start with, and I don't care. What I do know is that you've\\nmade bad enough a long chalk worse for all concerned, and you'll have to\\nget yourself out of the mess you've got yourself into, and there's only\\none way. I suppose Miss Denison has really told you everything this\\ntime? What's that? Oh, yes, she's all right again; no thanks to you. Now\\nlet's hear what she did tell you. It'll save time.”\\n\\nI repeated the hurried disclosures made by Eva in the rhododendrons. He\\nnodded grimly in confirmation of their truth.\\n\\n“Yes, those are the rough facts. The game was started in Melbourne. My\\npart was to wait at Ascension till the Lady Jermyn signalled herself,\\nfollow her in a schooner we had bought and pick up the gig with the gold\\naboard. Well, I did so; never mind the details now, and never mind the\\nbloody massacre the others had made of it before I came up. God knows I\\nwas never a consenting party to that, though I know I'm responsible.\\nI'm in this thing as deep as any of them. I've shared the risks and I'm\\ngoing to share the plunder, and I'll swing with the others if it ever\\ncomes to that. I deserve it hard enough. And so here we are, we three\\nand the nigger, all four fit to swing in a row, as you were fool enough\\nto tell us; and you step in and find out everything. What's to be done?\\nYou know what the others want to do. I say it rests with you whether\\nthey do it or not. There's only one other way of meeting the case.”\\n\\n“What's that?”\\n\\n“Be in it yourself, man! Come in with me and split my share!”\\n\\nI could have burst out laughing in his handsome, eager face; the good\\nfaith of this absurd proposal was so incongruously apparent; and so\\nobviously genuine was the young villain's anxiety for my consent. Become\\naccessory after the fact in such a crime! Sell my silence for a price! I\\nconcealed my feelings with equal difficulty and resolution. I had plans\\nof my own already, but I must gain time to think them over. Nor could I\\nafford to quarrel with Rattray meanwhile.\\n\\n“What was the haul?” I asked him, with the air of one not unprepared to\\nconsider the matter.\\n\\n“Twelve thousand ounces!”\\n\\n“Forty-eight thousand pounds, about?”\\n\\n“Yes-yes.”\\n\\n“And your share?”\\n\\n“Fourteen thousand pounds. Santos takes twenty, and Harris and I\\nfourteen thousand each.”\\n\\n“And you offer me seven?”\\n\\n“I do! I do!”\\n\\nHe was becoming more and more eager and excited. His eyes were brighter\\nthan I had ever seen them, but slightly bloodshot, and a coppery flush\\ntinged his clear, sunburnt skin. I fancied he had been making somewhat\\nfree with the brandy. But loss of blood had cooled my brain; and,\\nperhaps, natural perversity had also a share in the composure which grew\\nupon me as it deserted my companion.\\n\\n“Why make such a sacrifice?” said I, smiling. “Why not let them do as\\nthey like?”\\n\\n“I've told you why! I'm not so bad as all that. I draw the line at\\nbloody murder! Not a life should have been lost if I'd had my way.\\nBesides, I've done all the dirty work by you, Cole; there's been no\\nhelp for it. We didn't know whether you knew or not; it made all the\\ndifference to us; and somebody had to dog you and find out how much you\\ndid know. I was the only one who could possibly do it. God knows how I\\ndetested the job! I'm more ashamed of it than of worse things. I had to\\nworm myself into your friendship; and, by Jove, you made me think you\\ndid know, but hadn't let it out, and might any day. So then I got you up\\nhere, where you would be in our power if it was so; surely you can see\\nevery move? But this much I'll swear--I had nothing to do with Jose\\nbreaking into your room at the hotel; they went behind me there, curse\\nthem! And when at last I found out for certain, down here, that you knew\\nnothing after all, I was never more sincerely thankful in my life. I\\ngive you my word it took a load off my heart.”\\n\\n“I know that,” I said. “I also know who broke into my room, and I'm glad\\nI'm even with one of you.”\\n\\n“It's done you no good,” said Rattray. “Their first thought was to put\\nyou out of the way, and it's more than ever their last. You see the sort\\nof men you've got to deal with; and they're three to one, counting the\\nnigger; but if you go in with me they'll only be three to two.”\\n\\nHe was manifestly anxious to save me in this fashion. And I suppose that\\nmost sensible men, in my dilemma, would at least have nursed or played\\nupon good-will so lucky and so enduring. But there was always a twist in\\nme that made me love (in my youth) to take the unexpected course; and it\\namused me the more to lead my young friend on.\\n\\n“And where have you got this gold?” I asked him, in a low voice so\\npromising that he instantly lowered his, and his eyes twinkled naughtily\\ninto mine.\\n\\n“In the old tunnel that runs from this place nearly to the sea,” said\\nhe. “We Rattrays have always been a pretty warm lot, Cole, and in the\\nold days we were the most festive smugglers on the coast; this tunnel's\\na relic of 'em, although it was only a tradition till I came into the\\nproperty. I swore I'd find it, and when I'd done so I made the new\\nconnection which you shall see. I'm rather proud of it. And I won't say\\nI haven't used the old drain once or twice after the fashion of my rude\\nforefathers; but never was it such a godsend as it's been this time. By\\nJove, it would be a sin if you didn't come in with us, Cole; but for the\\nlives these blackguards lost the thing's gone splendidly; it would be a\\nsin if you went and lost yours, whereas, if you come in, the two of us\\nwould be able to shake off those devils: we should be too strong for\\n'em.”\\n\\n“Seven thousand pounds!” I murmured. “Forty-eight thousand between us!”\\n\\n“Yes, and nearly all of it down below, at this end of the tunnel, and\\nthe rest where we dropped it when we heard you were trying to bolt. We'd\\ngot it all at the other end, ready to pop aboard the schooner that's\\nlying there still, if you turned out to know anything and to have told\\nwhat you knew to the police. There was always the possibility of that,\\nyou see; we simply daren't show our noses at the bank until we knew how\\nmuch you knew, and what you'd done or were thinking of doing. As it is,\\nwe can take 'em the whole twelve thousand ounces, or rather I can, as\\nsoon as I like, in broad daylight. I'm a lucky digger. It's all right.\\nEverybody knows I've been out there. They'll have to pay me over the\\ncounter; and if you wait in the cab, by the Lord Harry, I'll pay you\\nyour seven thousand first! You don't deserve it, Cole, but you shall\\nhave it, and between us we'll see the others to blazes!”\\n\\nHe jumped up all excitement, and was at the door next instant.\\n\\n“Stop!” I cried. “Where are you going?”\\n\\n“Downstairs to tell them.”\\n\\n“Tell them what?”\\n\\n“That you're going in with me, and it's all right.”\\n\\n“And do you really think I am?”\\n\\nHe had unlocked the door; after a pause I heard him lock it again. But\\nI did not see his face until he returned to the bedside. And then it\\nfrightened me. It was distorted and discolored with rage and chagrin.\\n\\n“You've been making a fool of me!” he cried fiercely.\\n\\n“No, I have been considering the matter, Rattray.”\\n\\n“And you won't accept my offer?”\\n\\n“Of course I won't. I didn't say I'd been considering that.”\\n\\nHe stood over me with clenched fists and starting eyes.\\n\\n“Don't you see that I want to save your life?” he cried. “Don't you see\\nthat this is the only way? Do you suppose a murder more or less makes\\nany difference to that lot downstairs? Are you really such a fool as to\\ndie rather than hold your tongue?”\\n\\n“I won't hold it for money, at all events,” said I. “But that's what I\\nwas coming to.”\\n\\n“Very well!” he interrupted. “You shall only pretend to touch it. All I\\nwant is to convince the others that it's against your interest to split.\\nSelf-interest is the one motive they understand. Your bare word would be\\ngood enough for me.”\\n\\n“Suppose I won't give my bare word?” said I, in a gentle manner which I\\ndid not mean to be as irritating as it doubtless was. Yet his proposals\\nand his assumptions were between them making me irritable in my turn.\\n\\n“For Heaven's sake don't be such an idiot, Cole!” he burst out in a\\npassion. “You know I'm against the others, and you know what they want,\\nyet you do your best to put me on their side! You know what they are,\\nand yet you hesitate! For the love of God be sensible; at least give me\\nyour word that you'll hold your tongue for ever about all you know.”\\n\\n“All right,” I said. “I'll give you my word--my sacred promise,\\nRattray--on one condition.”\\n\\n“What's that?”\\n\\n“That you let me take Miss Denison away from you, for good and all!”\\n\\nHis face was transformed with fury: honest passion faded from it and\\nleft it bloodless, deadly, sinister.\\n\\n“Away from me?” said Rattray, through his teeth.\\n\\n“From the lot of you.”\\n\\n“I remember! You told me that night. Ha, ha, ha! You were in love with\\nher--you--you!”\\n\\n“That has nothing to do with it,” said I, shaking the bed with my anger\\nand my agitation.\\n\\n“I should hope not! You, indeed, to look at her!”\\n\\n“Well,” I cried, “she may never love me; but at least she doesn't loathe\\nme as she loathes you--yes, and the sight of you, and your very name!”\\n\\nSo I drew blood for blood; and for an instant I thought he was going to\\nmake an end of it by incontinently killing me himself. His fists flew\\nout. Had I been a whole man on my legs, he took care to tell me what he\\nwould have done, and to drive it home with a mouthful of the oaths which\\nwere conspicuously absent from his ordinary talk.\\n\\n“You take advantage of your weakness, like any cur,” he wound up.\\n\\n“And you of your strength--like the young bully you are!” I retorted.\\n\\n“You do your best to make me one,” he answered bitterly. “I try to stand\\nby you at all costs. I want to make amends to you, I want to prevent\\na crime. Yet there you lie and set your face against a compromise; and\\nthere you lie and taunt me with the thing that's gall and wormwood to me\\nalready. I know I gave you provocation. And I know I'm rightly served.\\nWhy do you suppose I went into this accursed thing at all? Not for the\\ngold, my boy, but for the girl! So she won't look at me. And it serves\\nme right. But--I say--do you really think she loathes me, Cole?”\\n\\n“I don't see how she can think much better of you than of the crime\\nin which you've had a hand,” was my reply, made, however, with as much\\nkindness as I could summon. “The word I used was spoken in anger,” said\\nI; for his had disappeared; and he looked such a miserable, handsome dog\\nas he stood there hanging his guilty head--in the room, I fancied, where\\nhe once had lain as a pretty, innocent child.\\n\\n“Cole,” said he, “I'd give twice my share of the damned stuff never to\\nhave put my hand to the plough; but go back I can't; so there's an end\\nof it.”\\n\\n“I don't see it,” said I. “You say you didn't go in for the gold? Then\\ngive up your share; the others'll jump at it; and Eva won't think the\\nworse of you, at any rate.”\\n\\n“But what's to become of her if I drop out?\\n\\n“You and I will take her to her friends, or wherever she wants to go.”\\n\\n“No, no!” he cried. “I never yet deserted my pals, and I'm not going to\\nbegin.”\\n\\n“I don't believe you ever before had such pals to desert,” was my reply\\nto that. “Quite apart from my own share in the matter, it makes me\\npositively sick to see a fellow like you mixed up with such a crew in\\nsuch a game. Get out of it, man, get out of it while you can! Now's your\\ntime. Get out of it, for God's sake!”\\n\\nI sat up in my eagerness. I saw him waver. And for one instant a great\\nhope fluttered in my heart. But his teeth met. His face darkened. He\\nshook his head.\\n\\n“That's the kind of rot that isn't worth talking, and you ought to know\\nit,” said he. “When I begin a thing I go through with it, though it\\nlands me in hell, as this one will. I can't help that. It's too late to\\ngo back. I'm going on and you're going with me, Cole, like a sensible\\nchap!”\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n“Only on the one condition.”\\n\\n“You--stick--to--that?” he said, so rapidly that the words ran into one,\\nso fiercely that his decision was as plain to me as my own.\\n\\n“I do,” said I, and could only sigh when he made yet one more effort to\\npersuade me, in a distress not less apparent than his resolution, and\\nnot less becoming in him.\\n\\n“Consider, Cole, consider!”\\n\\n“I have already done so, Rattray.”\\n\\n“Murder is simply nothing to them!”\\n\\n“It is nothing to me either.”\\n\\n“Human life is nothing!”\\n\\n“No; it must end one day.”\\n\\n“You won't give your word unconditionally?”\\n\\n“No; you know my condition.”\\n\\nHe ignored it with a blazing eye, his hand upon the door.\\n\\n“You prefer to die, then?” “Infinitely.”\\n\\n“Then die you may, and be damned to you!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII. THIEVES FALL OUT\\n\\n\\nThe door slammed. It was invisibly locked and the key taken out. I\\nlistened for the last of an angry stride. It never even began. But after\\na pause the door was unlocked again, and Rattray re-entered.\\n\\nWithout looking at me, he snatched the candle from the table on which it\\nstood by the bedside, and carried it to a bureau at the opposite side\\nof the room. There he stood a minute with his back turned, the candle,\\nI fancy, on the floor. I saw him putting something in either jacket\\npocket. Then I heard a dull little snap, as though he had shut some\\nsmall morocco case; whatever it was, he tossed it carelessly back into\\nthe bureau; and next minute he was really gone, leaving the candle\\nburning on the floor.\\n\\nI lay and heard his steps out of earshot, and they were angry enough\\nnow, nor had he given me a single glance. I listened until there was\\nno more to be heard, and then in an instant I was off the bed and on\\nmy feet. I reeled a little, and my head gave me great pain, but greater\\nstill was my excitement. I caught up the candle, opened the unlocked\\nbureau, and then the empty case which I found in the very front.\\n\\nMy heart leapt; there was no mistaking the depressions in the case. It\\nwas a brace of tiny pistols that Rattray had slipped into his jacket\\npockets.\\n\\nMere toys they must have been in comparison with my dear Deane and\\nAdams; that mattered nothing. I went no longer in dire terror of my\\nlife; indeed, there was that in Rattray which had left me feeling fairly\\nsafe, in spite of his last words to me, albeit I felt his fears on my\\nbehalf to be genuine enough. His taking these little pistols (of\\ncourse, there were but three chambers left loaded in mine) confirmed my\\nconfidence in him.\\n\\nHe would stick at nothing to defend me from the violence of his\\nbloodthirsty accomplices. But it should not come to that. My legs were\\ngrowing firmer under me. I was not going to lie there meekly without\\nmaking at least an effort at self-deliverance. If it succeeded--the\\nidea came to me in a flash--I would send Rattray an ultimatum from the\\nnearest town; and either Eva should be set instantly and unconditionally\\nfree, or the whole matter be put unreservedly in the hands of the local\\npolice.\\n\\nThere were two lattice windows, both in the same immensely thick wall;\\nto my joy, I discovered that they overlooked the open premises at the\\nback of the hall, with the oak-plantation beyond; nor was the distance\\nto the ground very great. It was the work of a moment to tear the sheets\\nfrom the bed, to tie the two ends together and a third round the mullion\\nby which the larger window was bisected. I had done this, and had let\\ndown my sheets, when a movement below turned my heart to ice. The night\\nhad clouded over. I could see nobody; so much the greater was my alarm.\\n\\nI withdrew from the window, leaving the sheets hanging, in the hope that\\nthey also might be invisible in the darkness. I put out the candle,\\nand returned to the window in great perplexity. Next moment I stood\\naghast--between the devil and the deep sea. I still heard a something\\ndown below, but a worse sound came to drown it. An unseen hand was very\\nquietly trying the door which Rattray had locked behind him.\\n\\n“Diablo!” came to my horrified ears, in a soft, vindictive voice.\\n\\n“I told ye so,” muttered another; “the young swab's got the key.”\\n\\nThere was a pause, in which it would seem that Joaquin Santos had his\\near at the empty keyhole.\\n\\n“I think he must be slipping,” at last I heard him sigh. “It was not\\nnecessary to awaken him in this world. It is a peety.”\\n\\n“One kick over the lock would do it,” said Harris; “only the young\\nswab'll hear.”\\n\\n“Not perhaps while he is dancing attendance on the senhora. Was it not\\ngood to send him to her? If he does hear, well, his own turn will come\\nthe queecker, that is all. But it would be better to take them one at a\\ntime; so keeck away, my friend, and I will give him no time to squil.”\\n\\nWhile my would-be murderers were holding this whispered colloquy, I had\\nstood half-petrified by the open window; unwilling to slide down the\\nsheets into the arms of an unseen enemy, though I had no idea which\\nof them it could be; more hopeful of slipping past my butchers in the\\ndarkness, and so to Rattray and poor Eva; but not the less eagerly\\nlooking for some hiding-place in the room. The best that offered was a\\nrecess in the thick wall between the two windows, filled with hanging\\nclothes: a narrow closet without a door, which would shelter me well\\nenough if not too curiously inspected. Here I hid myself in the end,\\nafter a moment of indecision which nearly cost me my life. The coats and\\ntrousers still shook in front of me when the door flew open at the first\\nkick, and Santos stood a moment in the moonlight, looking for the bed.\\nWith a stride he reached it, and I saw the gleam of a knife from where I\\nstood among the squire's clothes; it flashed over my bed, and was still.\\n\\n“He is not 'ere!”\\n\\n“He heard us, and he's a-hiding.”\\n\\n“Make light, my friend, and we shall very soon see.”\\n\\nHarris did so.\\n\\n“Here's a candle,” said Santos; “light it, and watch the door. Perro mal\\ndicto! What have we here?”\\n\\nI felt certain he had seen me, but the candle passed within a yard of my\\nfeet, and was held on high at the open window.\\n\\n“We are too late!” said Santos. “He's gone!”\\n\\n“Are you sure\\n\\n“Look at this sheet.”\\n\\n“Then the other swab knew of it, and we'll settle with him.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes. But not yet, my good friend--not yet. We want his asseestance\\nin getting the gold back to the sea; he will be glad enough to give it,\\nnow that his pet bird has flown; after that--by all mins. You shall cut\\nhis troth, and I will put one of 'is dear friend's bullets in 'im for my\\nown satisfaction.”\\n\\nThere was a quick step on the stairs-in the corridor.\\n\\n“I'd like to do it now,” whispered Harris; “no time like the present.”\\n\\n“Not yet, I tell you!”\\n\\nAnd Rattray was in the room, a silver-mounted pistol in each hand; the\\nsight of these was a surprise to his treacherous confederates, as even I\\ncould see.\\n\\n“What the devil are you two doing here?” he thundered.\\n\\n“We thought he was too quite,” said Santos. “You percive the rizzon.”\\n\\nAnd he waved from empty bed to open window, then held the candle close\\nto the tied sheet, and shrugged expressively.\\n\\n“You thought he was too quiet!” echoed Rattray with fierce scorn. “You\\nthought I was too blind--that's what you mean. To tell me that Miss\\nDenison wished to see me, and Miss Denison that I wished to speak to\\nher! As if we shouldn't find you out in about a minute! But a minute was\\nbetter than nothing, eh? And you've made good use of your minute, have\\nyou. You've murdered him, and you pretend he's got out? By God, if you\\nhave, I'll murder you! I've been ready for this all night!”\\n\\nAnd he stood with his back to the window, his pistols raised, and his\\nhead carried proudly--happily--like a man whose self-respect was coming\\nback to him after many days. Harris shrank before his fierce eyes\\nand pointed barrels. The Portuguese, however, had merely given a\\ncharacteristic shrug, and was now rolling the inevitable cigarette.\\n\\n“Your common sense is almost as remarkable as your sense of justice, my\\nfriend,” said he. “You see us one, two, tree meenutes ago, and you see\\nus now. You see the empty bed, the empty room, and you imagine that in\\none, two, tree meenutes we have killed a man and disposed of his body.\\nTruly, you are very wise and just, and very loyal also to your friends.\\nYou treat a dangerous enemy as though he were your tween-brother. You\\nlet him escape--let him, I repit--and then you threaten to shoot those\\nwho, as it is, may pay for your carelessness with their lives. We have\\nbeen always very loyal to you, Senhor Rattray. We have leestened to your\\nadvice, and often taken it against our better judgment. We are here, not\\nbecause we think it wise, but because you weeshed it. Yet at the first\\ntemptation you turn upon us, you point your peestols at your friends.”\\n\\n“I don't believe in your loyalty,” rejoined Rattray. “I believe you\\nwould shoot me sooner than I would you. The only difference would be\\nthan I should be shot in the back!”\\n\\n“It is untrue,” said Santos, with immense emotion. “I call the saints to\\nwitness that never by thought or word have I been disloyal to you”--and\\nthe blasphemous wretch actually crossed himself with a trembling, skinny\\nhand. “I have leestened to you, though you are the younger man. I have\\ngeeven way to you in everything from the moment we were so fullish as to\\nset foot on this accursed coast; that also was your doeeng; and it will\\nbe your fault if ivil comes of it. Yet I have not complained. Here\\nin your own 'ouse you have been the master, I the guest. So far from\\nplotting against you, show me the man who has heard me brith one\\ntreacherous word behind your back; you will find it deeficult, friend\\nRattray; what do you say, captain?”\\n\\n“Me?” cried Harris, in a voice bursting with abuse. And what the captain\\nsaid may or may not be imagined. It cannot be set down.\\n\\nBut the man who ought to have spoken--the man who had such a chance as\\nfew men have off the stage--who could have confounded these villains\\nin a breath, and saved the wretched Rattray at once from them and\\nfrom himself--that unheroic hero remained ignobly silent in his homely\\nhiding-place. And, what is more, he would do the same again!\\n\\nThe rogues had fallen out; now was the time for honest men. They all\\nthought I had escaped; therefore they would give me a better chance than\\never of still escaping; and I have already explained to what purpose\\nI meant to use my first hours of liberty. That purpose I hold to have\\njustified any ingratitude that I may seem now to have displayed towards\\nthe man who had undoubtedly stood between death and me. Was not Eva\\nDenison of more value than many Rattrays? And it was precisely in\\nrelation with this pure young girl that I most mistrusted the squire:\\nobviously then my first duty was to save Eva from Rattray, not Rattray\\nfrom these traitors.\\n\\nNot that I pretend for a moment to have been the thing I never was: you\\nare not so very grateful to the man who pulls you out of the mud when he\\nhas first of all pushed you in; nor is it chivalry alone which spurs\\none to the rescue of a lovely lady for whom, after all, one would rather\\nlive than die. Thus I, in my corner, was thinking (I will say) of Eva\\nfirst; but next I was thinking of myself; and Rattray's blood be on his\\nown hot head! I hold, moreover, that I was perfectly right in all this;\\nbut if any think me very wrong, a sufficient satisfaction is in store\\nfor them, for I was very swiftly punished.\\n\\nThe captain's language was no worse in character than in effect: the bed\\nwas bloody from my wounded head, all tumbled from the haste with which\\nI had quitted it, and only too suggestive of still fouler play. Rattray\\nstopped the captain with a sudden flourish of one of his pistols, the\\nsilver mountings making lightning in the room; then he called upon the\\npair of them to show him what they had done with me; and to my horror,\\nSantos invited him to search the room. The invitation was accepted. Yet\\nthere I stood. It would have been better to step forward even then. Yet\\nI cowered among his clothes until his own hand fell upon my collar, and\\nforth I was dragged to the plain amazement of all three.\\n\\nSantos was the first to find his voice.\\n\\n“Another time you will perhaps think twice before you spik, friend\\nsquire.”\\n\\nRattray simply asked me what I had been doing in there, in a white flame\\nof passion, and with such an oath that I embellished the truth for him\\nin my turn.\\n\\n“Trying to give you blackguards the slip,” said I.\\n\\n“Then it was you who let down the sheet?”\\n\\n“Of course it was.”\\n\\n“All right! I'm done with you,” said he; “that settles it. I make you an\\noffer. You won't accept it. I do my best; you do your worst; but I'll be\\nshot if you get another chance from me!”\\n\\nBrandy and the wine-glass stood where Rattray must have set them, on an\\noak stool beside the bed; as he spoke he crossed the room, filled\\nthe glass till the spirit dripped, and drained it at a gulp. He was\\ntwitching and wincing still when he turned, walked up to Joaquin Santos,\\nand pointed to where I stood with a fist that shook.\\n\\n“You wanted to deal with him,” said Rattray; “you're at liberty to do\\nso. I'm only sorry I stood in your way.”\\n\\nBut no answer, and for once no rings of smoke came from those shrivelled\\nlips: the man had rolled and lighted a cigarette since Rattray entered,\\nbut it was burning unheeded between his skinny fingers. I had his\\nattention, all to myself. He knew the tale that I was going to tell.\\nHe was waiting for it; he was ready for me. The attentive droop of his\\nhead; the crafty glitter in his intelligent eyes; the depth and\\nbreadth of the creased forehead; the knowledge of his resource, the\\nconsciousness of my error, all distracted and confounded me so that my\\nspeech halted and my voice ran thin. I told Rattray every syllable that\\nthese traitors had been saying behind his back, but I told it all very\\nill; what was worse, and made me worse, I was only too well aware of my\\nown failure to carry conviction with my words.\\n\\n“And why couldn't you come out and say so,” asked Rattray, as even I knew\\nthat he must. “Why wait till now?”\\n\\n“Ah, why!” echoed Santos, with a smile and a shake of the head; a\\nsuspicious tolerance, an ostentatious truce, upon his parchment face.\\nAnd already he was sufficiently relieved to suck his cigarette alight\\nagain.\\n\\n“You know why,” I said, trusting to bluff honesty with the one of them\\nwho was not rotten to the core: “because I still meant escaping.”\\n\\n“And then what?” asked Rattray fiercely.\\n\\n“You had given me my chance,” I said; “I hould have given you yours.”\\n\\n“You would, would you? Very kind of you, Mr. Cole!”\\n\\n“No, no,” said Santos; “not kind, but clever! Clever, spicious, and\\nqueeck-weeted beyond belif! Senhor Rattray, we have all been in the\\ndark; we thought we had fool to die with, but what admirable knave the\\nyoung man would make! Such readiness, such resource, with his tongue\\nor with his peestol; how useful would it be to us! I am glad you have\\ndecided to live him to me, friend Rattray, for I am quite come round to\\nyour way of thinking. It is no longer necessary for him to die!”\\n\\n“You mean that?” cried Rattray keenly.\\n\\n“Of course I min it. You were quite right. He must join us. But he will\\nwhen I talk to him.”\\n\\nI could not speak. I was fascinated by this wretch: it was reptile and\\nrabbit with us. Treachery I knew he meant; my death, for one; my death\\nwas certain; and yet I could not speak.\\n\\n“Then talk to him, for God's sake,” cried Rattray, “and I shall be only\\ntoo glad if you can talk some sense into him. I've tried, and failed.”\\n\\n“I shall not fail,” said Santos softly. “But it is better that he has a\\nleetle time to think over it calmly; better steel for 'im to slip upon\\nit, as you say. Let us live 'im for the night, what there is of it; time\\nenough in the morning.”\\n\\nI could hardly believe my ears; still I knew that it was treachery, all\\ntreachery; and the morning I should never see.\\n\\n“But we can't leave him up here,” said Rattray; “it would mean one of us\\nwatching him all night.”\\n\\n“Quite so,” said Santos. “I will tell you where we could live him,\\nhowever, if you will allow me to wheesper one leetle moment.”\\n\\nThey drew aside; and, as I live, I thought that little moment was to\\nbe Rattray's last on earth. I watched, but nothing happened; on the\\ncontrary, both men seemed agreed, the Portuguese gesticulating, the\\nEnglishman nodding, as they stood conversing at the window. Their faces\\nwere strangely reassuring. I began to reason with myself, to rid my mind\\nof mere presentiment and superstition. If these two really were at one\\nabout me (I argued) there might be no treachery after all. When I came\\nto think of it, Rattray had been closeted long enough with me to awake\\nthe worst suspicions in the breasts of his companions; now that these\\nwere allayed, there might be no more bloodshed after all (if, for\\nexample, I pretended to give in), even though Santos had not cared whose\\nblood was shed a few minutes since. That was evidently the character of\\nthe wretch: to compass his ends or to defend his person he would take\\nlife with no more compunction than the ordinary criminal takes money;\\nbut (and hence) murder for murder's sake was no amusement to him.\\n\\nMy confidence was further restored by Captain Harris; ever a gross\\nruffian, with no refinements to his rascality, he had been at the brandy\\nbottle after Rattray's example; and now was dozing on the latter's bed,\\ntaking his watch below when he could get it, like the good seaman he\\nhad been. I was quite sorry for him when the conversation at the window\\nceased suddenly, and Rattray roused the captain up.\\n\\n“Watches aft!” said he. “We want that mattress; you can bring it along,\\nwhile I lead the way with the pillows and things. Come on, Cole!”\\n\\n“Where to?” I asked, standing firm.\\n\\n“Where there's no window for you to jump out of, old boy, and no clothes\\nof mine for you to hide behind. You needn't look so scared; it's as dry\\nas a bone, as cellars go. And it's past three o'clock. And you've just\\ngot to come.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII. A MAN OF MANY MURDERS\\n\\n\\nIt was a good-sized wine-cellar, with very little wine in it; only one\\nfull bin could I discover. The bins themselves lined but two of the\\nwalls, and most of them were covered in with cobwebs, close-drawn like\\nmosquito-curtains. The ceiling was all too low: torpid spiders hung\\nin disreputable parlors, dead to the eye, but loathsomely alive at an\\ninvoluntary touch. Rats scuttled when we entered, and I had not been\\nlong alone when they returned to bear me company. I am not a natural\\nhistorian, and had rather face a lion with the right rifle than a rat\\nwith a stick. My jailers, however, had been kind enough to leave me a\\nlantern, which, set upon the ground (like my mattress), would afford a\\nwarning, if not a protection, against the worst; unless I slept; and as\\nyet I had not lain down. The rascals had been considerate enough, more\\nespecially Santos, who had a new manner for me with his revised opinion\\nof my character; it was a manner almost as courtly as that which had\\nembellished his relations with Eva Denison, and won him my early regard\\nat sea. Moreover, it was at the suggestion of Santos that they had\\ndetained me in the hall, for much-needed meat and drink, on the way\\ndown. Thereafter they had conducted me through the book-lined door of my\\nundoing, down stone stairs leading to three cellar doors, one of which\\nthey had double-locked upon me.\\n\\nAs soon as I durst I was busy with this door; but to no purpose; it was\\na slab of solid oak, hung on hinges as massive as its lock. It galled\\nme to think that but two doors stood between me and the secret tunnel to\\nthe sea: for one of the other two must lead to it. The first, however,\\nwas all beyond me, and I very soon gave it up. There was also a\\nvery small grating which let in a very little fresh air: the massive\\nfoundations had been tunnelled in one place; a rude alcove was the\\nresult, with this grating at the end and top of it, some seven feet\\nabove the earth floor. Even had I been able to wrench away the bars, it\\nwould have availed me nothing, since the aperture formed the segment of\\na circle whose chord was but a very few inches long. I had nevertheless\\na fancy for seeing the stars once more and feeling the breath of heaven\\nupon my bandaged temples, which impelled me to search for that which\\nshould add a cubit to my stature. And at a glance I descried two\\npacking-cases, rather small and squat, but the pair of them together\\nthe very thing for me. To my amazement, however, I could at first move\\nneither one nor the other of these small boxes. Was it that I was weak\\nas water, or that they were heavier than lead? At last I managed to get\\none of them in my arms--only to drop it with a thud. A side started;\\na thin sprinkling of yellow dust glittered on the earth. I fetched the\\nlantern: it was gold-dust from Bendigo or from Ballarat.\\n\\nTo me there was horror unspeakable, yet withal a morbid fascination,\\nin the spectacle of the actual booty for which so many lives had been\\nsacrificed before my eyes. Minute followed minute in which I looked at\\nnothing, and could think of nothing, but the stolen bullion at my feet;\\nthen I gathered what of the dust I could, pocketed it in pinches to hide\\nmy meddlesomeness, and blew the rest away. The box had dropped very much\\nwhere I had found it; it had exhausted my strength none the less, and\\nI was glad at last to lie down on the mattress, and to wind my body in\\nRattray's blankets.\\n\\nI shuddered at the thought of sleep: the rats became so lively the\\nmoment I lay still. One ventured so near as to sit up close to the\\nlantern; the light showed its fat white belly, and the thing itself was\\nlike a dog begging, as big to my disgusted eyes. And yet, in the midst\\nof these horrors (to me as bad as any that had preceded them), nature\\novercame me, and for a space my torments ceased.\\n\\n“He is aslip,” a soft voice said.\\n\\n“Don't wake the poor devil,” said another.\\n\\n“But I weesh to spik with 'im. Senhor Cole! Senhor Cole!”\\n\\nI opened my eyes. Santos looked of uncanny stature in the low yellow\\nlight, from my pillow close to the earth. Harris turned away at my\\nglance; he carried a spade, and began digging near the boxes without\\nmore ado, by the light of a second lantern set on one of them: his back\\nwas to me from this time on. Santos shrugged a shoulder towards the\\ncaptain as he opened a campstool, drew up his trousers, and seated\\nhimself with much deliberation at the foot of my mattress.\\n\\n“When you 'ave treasure,” said he, “the better thing is to bury it,\\nSenhor Cole. Our young friend upstairs begs to deefer; but he is\\nslipping; it is peety he takes such quantity of brandy! It is leetle\\nwikness of you Engleesh; we in Portugal never touch it, save as a\\nliqueur; therefore we require less slip. Friend squire upstairs is at\\nthis moment no better than a porker. Have I made mistake? I thought it\\nwas the same word in both languages; but I am glad to see you smile,\\nSenhor Cole; that is good sign. I was going to say, he is so fast aslip\\nup there, that he would not hear us if we were to shoot each other\\ndead!”\\n\\nAnd he gave me his paternal smile, benevolent, humorous, reassuring; but\\nI was no longer reassured; nor did I greatly care any more what happened\\nto me. There is a point of last, as well as one of least resistance, and\\nI had reached both points at once.\\n\\n“Have you shot him dead?” I inquired, thinking that if he had, this\\nwould precipitate my turn. But he was far from angry; the parchment\\nface crumpled into tolerant smiles; the venerable head shook a playful\\nreproval, as he threw away the cigarette that I am tired of mentioning,\\nand put the last touch to a fresh one with his tongue.\\n\\n“What question?” said he; “reely, Senhor Cole! But you are quite right:\\nI would have shot him, or cut his troth” (and he shrugged indifference\\non the point), “if it had not been for you; and yet it would have been\\nyour fault! I nid not explain; the poseetion must have explained itself\\nalready; besides, it is past. With you two against us--but it is past.\\nYou see, I have no longer the excellent Jose. You broke his leg, bad\\nman. I fear it will be necessary to destroy 'im.” Santos made a pause;\\nthen inquired if he shocked me.\\n\\n“Not a bit,” said I, neither truly nor untruly; “you interest me.” And\\nthat he did.\\n\\n“You see,” he continued, “I have not the respect of you Engleesh for\\n'uman life. We will not argue it. I have at least some respect for\\nprejudice. In my youth I had myself such prejudices; but one loses them\\non the Zambesi. You cannot expect one to set any value upon the life of\\na black nigger; and when you have keeled a great many Kaffirs, by the\\nlash, with the crocodiles, or what-not, then a white man or two makes\\nless deeference. I acknowledge there were too many on board that sheep;\\nbut what was one to do? You have your Engleesh proverb about the dead\\nmen and the stories; it was necessary to make clin swip. You see the\\nresult.”\\n\\nHe shrugged again towards the boxes; but this time, being reminded\\nof them (I supposed), he rose and went over to see how Harris was\\nprogressing. The captain had never looked round; neither did he look at\\nSantos. “A leetle dipper,” I heard the latter say, “and, perhaps, a few\\neenches--” but I lost the last epithet. It followed a glance over the\\nshoulder in my direction, and immediately preceded the return of Santos\\nto his camp-stool.\\n\\n“Yes, it is always better to bury treasure,” said he once more; but his\\ntone was altered; it was more contemplative; and many smoke-rings came\\nfrom the shrunk lips before another word; but through them all, his dark\\neyes, dull with age, were fixed upon me.\\n\\n“You are a treasure!” he exclaimed at last, softly enough, but quickly\\nand emphatically for him, and with a sudden and most diabolical smile.\\n\\n“So you are going to bury me?”\\n\\nI had suspected it when first I saw the spade; then not; but since the\\nvisit to the hole I had made up my mind to it.\\n\\n“Bury you? No, not alive,” said Santos, in his playfully reproving\\ntone. “It would be necessary to deeg so dip!” he added through his few\\nremaining teeth.\\n\\n“Well,” I said, “you'll swing for it. That's something.”\\n\\nSantos smiled again, benignantly enough this time: in contemplation\\nalso: as an artist smiles upon his work. I was his!\\n\\n“You live town,” said he; “no one knows where you go. You come down\\nhere; no one knows who you are. Your dear friend squire locks you up\\nfor the night, but dreenks too much and goes to slip with the key in his\\npocket; it is there when he wakes; but the preesoner, where is he? He is\\ngone, vanished, escaped in the night, and, like the base fabreec of your\\nown poet's veesion, he lives no trace--is it trace?--be'ind! A leetle\\nearth is so easily bitten down; a leetle more is so easily carried up\\ninto the garden; and a beet of nice strong wire might so easily be\\nfound in a cellar, and afterwards in the lock! No, Senhor Cole, I do not\\nexpect to 'ang. My schims have seldom one seengle flaw. There was just\\none in the Lady Jermyn; there was--Senhor Cole! If there is one this\\ntime, and you will be so kind as to point it out, I will--I will run the\\nreesk of shooting you instead of--”\\n\\nA pinch of his baggy throat, between the fingers and thumbs of both\\nhands, foreshadowed a cleaner end; and yet I could look at him; nay, it\\nwas more than I could do not to look upon that bloodless face, with the\\ntwo dry blots upon the parchment, that were never withdrawn from mine.\\n\\n“No you won't, messmate! If it's him or us for it, let a bullet do it,\\nand let it do it quick, you bloody Spaniard! You can't do the other\\nwithout me, and my part's done.”\\n\\nHarris was my only hope. I had seen this from the first, but my appeal\\nI had been keeping to the very end. And now he was leaving me before a\\nword would come! Santos had gone over to my grave, and there was Harris\\nat the door!\\n\\n“It is not dip enough,” said the Portuguese.\\n\\n“It's as deep as I mean to make it, with you sittin' there talkin' about\\nit.”\\n\\nAnd the door stood open.\\n\\n“Captain!” I screamed. “For Christ's sake, captain!”\\n\\nHe stood there, trembling, yet even now not looking my way.\\n\\n“Did you ever see a man hanged?” asked Santos, with a vile eye for each\\nof us. “I once hanged fifteen in a row; abominable thifs. And I once\\npoisoned nearly a hundred at one banquet; an untrustworthy tribe; but\\nthe hanging was the worse sight and the worse death. Heugh! There was\\none man--he was no stouter than you are captain--”\\n\\nBut the door slammed; we heard the captain on the stairs; there was a\\nrustle from the leaves outside, and then a silence that I shall not\\nattempt to describe.\\n\\nAnd, indeed, I am done with this description: as I live to tell the tale\\n(or spoil it, if I choose) I will make shorter work of this particular\\nbusiness than I found it at the time. Perverse I may be in old age as\\nin my youth; but on that my agony--my humiliating agony--I decline\\nto dwell. I suffer it afresh as I write. There are the cobwebs on the\\nceiling, a bloated spider crawling in one: a worse monster is gloating\\nover me: those dull eyes of his, and my own pistol-barrel, cover me in\\nthe lamp-light. The crucifix pin is awry in his cravat; that is because\\nhe has offered it me to kiss. As a refinement (I feel sure) my revolver\\nis not cocked; and the hammer goes up--up--\\n\\nHe missed me because a lantern was flashed into his eyes through the\\ngrating. He wasted the next ball in firing wildly at the light. And\\nthe last chamber's load became suddenly too precious for my person; for\\nthere were many voices overhead; there were many feet upon the stairs.\\n\\nHarris came first--head-first--saw me still living as he reeled--hurled\\nhimself upon the boxes and one of these into the hole--all far quicker\\nthan my pen can write it. The manoeuvre, being the captain's, explained\\nitself: on his heels trod Rattray, with one who brought me to my feet\\nlike the call of silver trumpets.\\n\\n“The house is surrounded,” says the squire, very quick and quiet; “is\\nthis your doing, Cole?”\\n\\n“I wish it was,” said I; “but I can't complain; it's saved my life.”\\n And I looked at Santos, standing dignified and alert, my still smoking\\npistol in his hand.\\n\\n“Two things to do,” says Rattray--“I don't care which.” He strode across\\nthe cellar and pulled at the one full bin; something slid out, it was a\\nbinful of empty bottles, and this time they were allowed to crash upon\\nthe floor; the squire stood pointing to a manhole at the back of the\\nbin. “That's one alternative,” said he; “but it will mean leaving this\\nmuch stuff at least,” pointing to the boxes, “and probably all the rest\\nat the other end. The other thing's to stop and fight!”\\n\\n“I fight,” said Santos, stalking to the door. “Have you no more\\nammunition for me, friend Cole? Then I must live you alive; adios,\\nsenhor!”\\n\\nHarris cast a wistful look towards the manhole, not in cowardice, I\\nfancy, but in sudden longing for the sea, the longing of a poor devil\\nof a sailor-man doomed to die ashore. I am still sorry to remember that\\nRattray judged him differently. “Come on, skipper,” said he; “it's all\\nor none aboard the lugger, and I think it will be none. Up you go; wait\\na second in the room above, and I'll find you an old cutlass. I shan't\\nbe longer.” He turned to me with a wry smile. “We're not half-armed,” he\\nsaid; “they've caught us fairly on the hop; it should be fun! Good-by,\\nCole; I wish you'd had another round for that revolver. Good-by, Eva!”\\n\\nAnd he held out his hand to our love, who had been watching him all this\\ntime with eyes of stone; but now she turned her back upon him without\\na word. His face changed; the stormlight of passion and remorse played\\nupon it for an instant; he made a step towards her, wheeled abruptly,\\nand took me by the shoulder instead.\\n\\n“Take care of her, Cole,” said he. “Whatever happens--take care of her.”\\n\\nI caught him at the foot of the stairs. I do not defend what I did. But\\nI had more ammunition; a few wadded bullets, caps, and powder-charges,\\nloose in a jacket pocket; and I thrust them into one of his, upon a\\nsudden impulse, not (as I think) altogether unaccountable, albeit (as I\\nhave said) so indefensible.\\n\\nMy back was hardly turned an instant. I had left a statue of unforgiving\\ncoldness. I started round to catch in my arms a half-fainting,\\ngrief-stricken form, shaken with sobs that it broke my heart to hear. I\\nplaced her on the camp-stool. I knelt down and comforted her as well as\\nI could, stroking her hands, my arm about her heaving shoulders, with\\nthe gold-brown hair streaming over them. Such hair as it was! So much\\nlonger than I had dreamt. So soft--so fine--my soul swam with the sight\\nand touch of it. Well for me that there broke upon us from above such\\na sudden din as turned my hot blood cold! A wild shout of surprise; an\\nensuing roar of defiance; shrieks and curses; yells of rage and pain;\\nand pistol-shot after pistol-shot as loud as cannon in the confined\\nspace.\\n\\nI know now that the battle in the hall was a very brief affair; while\\nit lasted I had no sense of time; minutes or moments, they were (God\\nforgive me!) some of the very happiest in all my life. My joy was as\\nprofound as it was also selfish and incongruous. The villains were being\\nrouted; of that there could be no doubt or question. I hoped Rattray\\nmight escape, but for the others no pity stirred in my heart, and even\\nmy sneaking sympathy with the squire could take nothing from the joy\\nthat was in my heart. Eva Denison was free. I was free. Our oppressors\\nwould trouble us no more. We were both lonely; we were both young; we\\nhad suffered together and for each other. And here she lay in my arms,\\nher head upon my shoulder, her soft bosom heaving on my own! My blood\\nran hot and cold by turns. I forgot everything but our freedom and my\\nlove. I forgot my sufferings, as I would have you all forget them. I\\nam not to be pitied. I have been in heaven on earth. I was there that\\nnight, in my great bodily weakness, and in the midst of blood-shed,\\ndeath, and crime.\\n\\n“They have stopped!” cried Eva suddenly. “It is over! Oh, if he is\\ndead!”\\n\\nAnd she sat upright, with bright eyes starting from a deathly face. I do\\nnot think she knew that she had been in my arms at all: any more than I\\nknew that the firing had ceased before she told me. Excited voices were\\nstill raised overhead; but some sounded distant, yet more distinct,\\ncoming through the grating from the garden; and none were voices that we\\nknew. One poor wretch, on the other hand, we heard plainly groaning to\\nhis death; and we looked in each other's eyes with the same thought.\\n\\n“That's Harris,” said I, with, I fear, but little compassion in my tone\\nor in my heart just then.\\n\\n“Where are the others?” cried Eva piteously.\\n\\n“God knows,” said I; “they may be done for, too.”\\n\\n“If they are!”\\n\\n“It's better than the death they would have lived to die.”\\n\\n“But only one of them was a wilful murderer! Oh, Mr. Cole--Mr. Cole--go\\nand see what has happened; come back and tell me! I dare not come. I\\nwill stay here and pray for strength to bear whatever news you may bring\\nme. Go quickly. I will--wait--and pray!”\\n\\nSo I left the poor child on her knees in that vile cellar, white face\\nand straining hands uplifted to the foul ceiling, sweet lips quivering\\nwith prayer, eyelids reverently lowered, and the swift tears flowing\\nfrom beneath them, all in the yellow light of the lantern that stood\\nburning by her side. How different a picture from that which awaited me\\noverhead!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX. MY GREAT HOUR\\n\\n\\nThe library doors were shut, and I closed the secret one behind me\\nbefore opening the other and peering out through a wrack of bluish\\nsmoke; and there lay Captain Harris, sure enough, breathing his last in\\nthe arms of one constable, while another was seated on the table with a\\nvery wry face, twisting a tourniquet round his arm, from which the blood\\nwas dripping like raindrops from the eaves. A third officer stood in the\\nporch, issuing directions to his men without.\\n\\n“He's over the wall, I tell you! I saw him run up our ladder. After him\\nevery man of you--and spread!”\\n\\nI looked in vain for Rattray and the rest; yet it seemed as if only\\none of them had escaped. I was still looking when the man in the porch\\nwheeled back into the hall, and instantly caught sight of me at my door.\\n\\n“Hillo! here's another of them,” cried he. “Out you come, young fellow!\\nYour mates are all dead men.”\\n\\n“They're not my mates.”\\n\\n“Never mind; come you out and let's have a look at you.”\\n\\nI did so, and was confronted by a short, thickset man, who recognized me\\nwith a smile, but whom I failed to recognize.\\n\\n“I might have guessed it was Mr. Cole,” said he. “I knew you were here\\nsomewhere, but I couldn't make head or tail of you through the smoke.”\\n\\n“I'm surprised that you can make head or tail of me at all,” said I.\\n\\n“Then you've quite forgotten the inquisitive parson you met out fishing?\\nYou see I found out your name for myself!”\\n\\n“So it was a detective!”\\n\\n“It was and is,” said the little man, nodding. “Detective or Inspector\\nRoyds, if you're any the wiser.\\n\\n“What has happened? Who has escaped?” “Your friend Rattray; but he won't\\nget far.”\\n\\n“What of the Portuguese and the nigger?”\\n\\nI forgot that I had crippled Jose, but remembered with my words, and\\nwondered the more where he was.\\n\\n“I'll show you,” said Royds. “It was the nigger let us in. We heard him\\ngroaning round at the back--who smashed his leg? One of our men was at\\nthat cellar grating; there was some of them down there; we wanted to\\nfind our way down and corner them, but the fat got in the fire too soon.\\nCan you stand something strong? Then come this way.”\\n\\nHe led me out into the garden, and to a tangled heap lying in the\\nmoonlight, on the edge of the long grass. The slave had fallen on top\\nof his master; one leg lay swathed and twisted; one black hand had but\\npartially relaxed upon the haft of a knife (the knife) that stood up\\nhilt-deep in a blacker heart. And in the hand of Santos was still the\\nrevolver (my Deane and Adams) which had sent its last ball through the\\nnigger's body.\\n\\n“They slipped out behind us, all but the one inside,” said Royds,\\nruefully; “I'm hanged if I know yet how it happened--but we were on them\\nnext second. Before that the nigger had made us hide him in the grass,\\nbut the old devil ran straight into him, and the one fired as the other\\nstruck. It's the worst bit of luck in the whole business, and I'm rather\\ndisappointed on the whole. I've been nursing the job all this week; had\\nmy last look round this very evening, with one of these officers, and\\nonly rode back for more to make sure of taking our gentlemen alive. And\\nwe've lost three out of four of 'em, and have still to lay hands on\\nthe gold! I suppose you didn't know there was any aboard?” he asked\\nabruptly.\\n\\n“Not before to-night.”\\n\\n“Nor did we till the Devoren came in with letters last week, a hundred\\nand thirty days out. She should have been in a month before you, but she\\ngot amongst the ice around the Horn. There was a letter of advice about\\nthe gold, saying it would probably go in the Lady Jermyn; and another\\nabout Rattray and his schooner, which had just sailed; the young\\ngentleman was known to the police out there.”\\n\\n“Do you know where the schooner is?”\\n\\n“Bless you, no, we've had no time to think about her; the man had been\\nseen about town, and we've done well to lay hands on him in the time.”\\n\\n“You will do better still when you do lay hands on him,” said I,\\nwresting my eyes from the yellow dead face of the foreign scoundrel.\\nThe moon shone full upon his high forehead, his shrivelled lips, dank in\\ntheir death agony, and on the bauble with the sacred device that he wore\\nalways in his tie. I recovered my property from the shrunken fingers,\\nand so turned away with a harder heart than I ever had before or since\\nfor any creature of Almighty God.\\n\\nHarris had expired in our absence.\\n\\n“Never spoke, sir,” said the constable in whose arms we had left him.\\n\\n“More's the pity. Well, cut out at the back and help land the young\\ngent, or we'll have him giving us the slip too. He may double back,\\nbut I'm watching out for that. Which way should you say he'd head, Mr.\\nCole?”\\n\\n“Inland,” said I, lying on the spur of the moment, I knew not why. “Try\\nat the cottage where I've been staying.”\\n\\n“We have a man posted there already. That woman is one of the gang,\\nand we've got her safe. But I'll take your advice, and have that side\\nscoured whilst I hang about the place.”\\n\\nAnd he walked through the house, and out the back way, at the officer's\\nheels; meanwhile the man with the wounded arm was swaying where he sat\\nfrom loss of blood, and I had to help him into the open air before at\\nlast I was free to return to poor Eva in her place of loathsome safety.\\n\\nI had been so long, however, that her patience was exhausted, and as I\\nreturned to the library by one door, she entered by the other.\\n\\n“I could bear it no longer. Tell me--the worst!”\\n\\n“Three of them are dead.”\\n\\n“Which three?”\\n\\nShe had crossed to the other door, and would not have me shut it. So\\nI stood between her and the hearth, on which lay the captain's corpse,\\nwith the hearthrug turned up on either side to cover it.\\n\\n“Harris for one,” said I. “Outside lie Jose and--”\\n\\n“Quick! Quick!”\\n\\n“Senhor Santos.”\\n\\nHer face was as though the name meant nothing to her.\\n\\n“And Mr. Rattray?” she cried. “And Mr. Rattray--”\\n\\n“Has escaped for the present. He seems to have cut his way through the\\npolice and got over the wall by a ladder they left behind them. They are\\nscouring the country--Miss Denison! Eva! My poor love!”\\n\\nShe had broken down utterly in a second fit of violent weeping; and a\\nsecond time I took her in my arms, and stood trying in my clumsy way to\\ncomfort her, as though she were a little child. A lamp was burning in\\nthe library, and I recognized the arm-chair which Rattray had drawn\\nthence for me on the night of our dinner--the very night before! I led\\nEva back into the room, and I closed both doors. I supported my poor\\ngirl to the chair, and once more I knelt before her and took her hands\\nin mine. My great hour was come at last: surely a happy omen that it was\\nalso the hour before the dawn.\\n\\n“Cry your fill, my darling,” I whispered, with the tears in my own\\nvoice. “You shall never have anything more to cry for in this world! God\\nhas been very good to us. He brought you to me, and me to you. He has\\nrescued us for each other. All our troubles are over; cry your fill; you\\nwill never have another chance so long as I live, if only you will let\\nme live for you. Will you, Eva? Will you? Will you?”\\n\\nShe drew her hands from mine, and sat upright in the chair, looking at\\nme with round eyes; but mine were dim; astonishment was all that I\\ncould read in her look, and on I went headlong, with growing impetus and\\npassion.\\n\\n“I know I am not much, my darling; but you know I was not always what my\\nluck, good and bad, has left me now, and you will make a new man of\\nme so soon! Besides, God must mean it, or He would not have thrown us\\ntogether amid such horrors, and brought us through them together still.\\nAnd you have no one else to take care of you in the world! Won't you let\\nme try, Eva? Say that you will!”\\n\\n“Then--you--owe me?” she said slowly, in a low, awe-struck voice that\\nmight have told me my fate at once; but I was shaking all over in the\\nintensity of my passion, and for the moment it was joy enough to be able\\nat last to tell her all.\\n\\n“Love you?” I echoed. “With every fibre of my being! With every atom of\\nmy heart and soul and body! I love you well enough to live to a hundred\\nfor you, or to die for you to-night!”\\n\\n“Well enough to--give me up?” she whispered.\\n\\nI felt as though a cold hand had checked my heart at its hottest, but\\nI mastered myself sufficiently to face her question and to answer it as\\nhonestly as I might.\\n\\n“Yes!” I cried; “well enough even to do that, if it was for your\\nhappiness; but I might be rather difficult to convince about that.”\\n\\n“You are very strong and true,” she murmured. “Yes, I can trust you as\\nI have never trusted anybody else! But--how long have you been so\\nfoolish?” And she tried very hard to smile.\\n\\n“Since I first saw you; but I only knew it on the night of the fire.\\nTill that night I resisted it like an idiot. Do you remember how we used\\nto argue? I rebelled so against my love! I imagined that I had loved\\nonce already and once for all. But on the night of the fire I knew that\\nmy love for you was different from all that had gone before or would\\never come again. I gave in to it at last, and oh! the joy of giving in!\\nI had fought against the greatest blessing of my life, and I never knew\\nit till I had given up fighting. What did I care about the fire? I\\nwas never happier--until now! You sang through my heart like the wind\\nthrough the rigging; my one fear was that I might go to the bottom\\nwithout telling you my love. When I asked to say a few last words to you\\non the poop, it was to tell you my love before we parted, that you might\\nknow I loved you whatever came. I didn't do so, because you seemed\\nso frightened, poor darling! I hadn't it in my heart to add to your\\ndistress. So I left you without a word. But I fought the sea for days\\ntogether simply to tell you what I couldn't die without telling you.\\nWhen they picked me up, it was your name that brought back my senses\\nafter days of delirium. When I heard that you were dead, I longed to\\ndie myself. And when I found you lived after all, the horror of your\\nsurroundings was nothing to be compared with the mere fact that you\\nlived; that you were unhappy and in danger was my only grief, but it was\\nnothing to the thought of your death; and that I had to wait twenty-four\\nhours without coming to you drove me nearer to madness than ever I was\\non the hen-coop. That's how I love you, Eva,” I concluded; “that's how I\\nlove and will love you, for ever and ever, no matter what happens.”\\n\\nThose sweet gray eyes of hers had been fixed very steadily upon me all\\nthrough this outburst; as I finished they filled with tears, and my poor\\nlove sat wringing her slender fingers, and upbraiding herself as though\\nshe were the most heartless coquette in the country.\\n\\n“How wicked I am!” she moaned. “How ungrateful I must be! You offer me\\nthe unselfish love of a strong, brave man. I cannot take it. I have no\\nlove to give you in return.”\\n\\n“But some day you may,” I urged, quite happily in my ignorance. “It\\nwill come. Oh, surely it will come, after all that we have gone through\\ntogether!”\\n\\nShe looked at me very steadily and kindly through her tears.\\n\\n“It has come, in a way,” said she; “but it is not your way, Mr. Cole. I\\ndo love you for your bravery and your--love--but that will not quite do\\nfor either of us.”\\n\\n“Why not?” I cried in an ecstasy. “My darling, it will do for me! It\\nis more than I dared to hope for; thank God, thank God, that you should\\ncare for me at all!”\\n\\nShe shook her head.\\n\\n“You do not understand,” she whispered.\\n\\n“I do. I do. You do not love me as you want to love.”\\n\\n“As I could love--”\\n\\n“And as you will! It will come. It will come. I'll bother you no more\\nabout it now. God knows I can afford to leave well alone! I am only too\\nhappy--too thankful--as it is!”\\n\\nAnd indeed I rose to my feet every whit as joyful as though she had\\naccepted me on the spot. At least she had not rejected me; nay, she\\nconfessed to loving me in a way. What more could a lover want? Yet there\\nwas a dejection in her drooping attitude which disconcerted me in the\\nhour of my reward. And her eyes followed me with a kind of stony remorse\\nwhich struck a chill to my bleeding heart.\\n\\nI went to the door; the hall was still empty, and I shut it again with a\\nshudder at what I saw before the hearth, at all that I had forgotten\\nin the little library. As I turned, another door opened--the door made\\ninvisible by the multitude of books around and upon it--and young Squire\\nRattray stood between my love and me.\\n\\nHis clear, smooth skin was almost as pale as Eva's own, but pale brown,\\nthe tint of rich ivory. His eyes were preternaturally bright. And they\\nnever glanced my way, but flew straight to Eva, and rested on her very\\nhumbly and sadly, as her two hands gripped the arms of the chair, and\\nshe leant forward in horror and alarm.\\n\\n“How could you come back?” she cried. “I was told you had escaped!”\\n\\n“Yes, I got away on one of their horses.”\\n\\n“I pictured you safe on board!”\\n\\n“I very nearly was.”\\n\\n“Then why are you here?”\\n\\n“To get your forgiveness before I go.”\\n\\nHe took a step forward; her eyes and mine were riveted upon him; and I\\nstill wonder which of us admired him the more, as he stood there in his\\npride and his humility, gallant and young, and yet shamefaced and sad.\\n\\n“You risk your life--for my forgiveness?” whispered Eva at last. “Risk\\nit? I'll give myself up if you'll take back some of the things you said\\nto me--last night--and before.”\\n\\nThere was a short pause.\\n\\n“Well, you are not a coward, at all events!”\\n\\n“Nor a murderer, Eva!”\\n\\n“God forbid.”\\n\\n“Then forgive me for everything else that I have been--to you!”\\n\\nAnd he was on his knees where I had knelt scarce a minute before; nor\\ncould I bear to watch them any longer. I believed that he loved her in\\nhis own way as sincerely as I did in mine. I believed that she detested\\nhim for the detestable crime in which he had been concerned. I believed\\nthat the opinion of him which she had expressed to his face, in my\\nhearing, was her true opinion, and I longed to hear her mitigate it ever\\nso little before he went. He won my sympathy as a gallant who valued\\na kind word from his mistress more than life itself. I hoped earnestly\\nthat that kind word would be spoken. But I had no desire to wait to hear\\nit. I felt an intruder. I would leave them alone together for the last\\ntime. So I walked to the door, but, seeing a key in it, I changed\\nmy mind, and locked it on the inside. In the hall I might become the\\nunintentional instrument of the squire's capture, though, so far as my\\nears served me, it was still empty as we had left it. I preferred to run\\nno risks, and would have a look at the subterranean passage instead.\\n\\n“I advise you to speak low,” I said, “and not to be long. The place is\\nalive with the police. If they hear you all will be up.”\\n\\nWhether he heard me I do not know. I left him on his knees still, and\\nEva with her face hidden in her hands.\\n\\nThe cellar was a strange scene to revisit within an hour of my\\ndeliverance from that very torture-chamber. It had been something more\\nbefore I left it, but in it I could think only of the first occupant of\\nthe camp-stool. The lantern still burned upon the floor. There was the\\nmattress, still depressed where I had lain face to face with insolent\\ndeath. The bullet was in the plaster; it could not have missed by the\\nbreadth of many hairs. In the corner was the shallow grave, dug by\\nHarris for my elements. And Harris was dead. And Santos was dead. But\\nlife and love were mine.\\n\\nI would have gone through it all again!\\n\\nAnd all at once I was on fire to be back in the library; so much so,\\nthat half a minute at the manhole, lantern in hand, was enough for me;\\nand a mere funnel of moist brown earth--a terribly low arch propped with\\nbeams--as much as I myself ever saw of the subterranean conduit between\\nKirby House and the sea. But I understood that the curious may traverse\\nit for themselves to this day on payment of a very modest fee.\\n\\nAs for me, I returned as I had come after (say) five minutes' absence;\\nmy head full once more of Eva, and of impatient anxiety for the wild\\nyoung squire's final flight; and my heart still singing with the joy of\\nwhich my beloved's kindness seemed a sufficient warranty. Poor egotist!\\nAm I to tell you what I found when I came up those steep stairs to the\\nchamber where I had left him on his knees to her? Or can you guess?\\n\\nHe was on his knees no more, but he held her in his arms, and as I\\nentered he was kissing the tears from her wet, flushed cheek. Her\\neyelids drooped; she was pale as the dead without, so pale that her\\neyebrows looked abnormally and dreadfully dark. She did not cling to\\nhim. Neither did she resist his caresses, but lay passive in his arms as\\nthough her proper paradise was there. And neither heard me enter; it was\\nas though they had forgotten all the world but one another.\\n\\n“So this is it,” said I very calmly. I can hear my voice as I write.\\n\\nThey fell apart on the instant. Rattray glared at me, yet I saw that his\\neyes were dim. Eva clasped her hands before her, and looked me steadily\\nin the face. But never a word.\\n\\n“You love him?” I said sternly.\\n\\nThe silence of consent remained unbroken.\\n\\n“Villain as he is?” I burst out.\\n\\nAnd at last Eva spoke.\\n\\n“I loved him before he was one,” said she. “We were engaged.”\\n\\nShe looked at him standing by, his head bowed, his arms folded; next\\nmoment she was very close to me, and fresh tears were in her eyes. But I\\nstepped backward, for I had had enough.\\n\\n“Can you not forgive me?”\\n\\n“Oh, dear, yes.”\\n\\n“Can't you understand?”\\n\\n“Perfectly,” said I.\\n\\n“You know you said--”\\n\\n“I have said so many things!”\\n\\n“But this was that you--you loved me well enough to--give me up.”\\n\\nAnd the silly ego in me--the endless and incorrigible I--imagined her\\npouting for a withdrawal of those brave words.\\n\\n“I not only said it,” I declared, “but I meant every word of it.”\\n\\nNone the less had I to turn from her to hide my anguish. I leaned my\\nelbows on the narrow stone chimney-piece, which, with the grate below\\nand a small mirror above, formed an almost solitary oasis in the four\\nwalls of books. In the mirror I saw my face; it was wizened, drawn, old\\nbefore its time, and merely ugly in its sore distress, merely repulsive\\nin its bloody bandages. And in the mirror also I saw Rattray, handsome,\\nromantic, audacious, all that I was not, nor ever would be, and I\\n“understood” more than ever, and loathed my rival in my heart.\\n\\nI wheeled round on Eva. I was not going to give her up--to him. I would\\ntell her so before him--tell him so to his face. But she had turned\\naway; she was listening to some one else. Her white forehead glistened.\\nThere were voices in the hall.\\n\\n“Mr. Cole! Mr. Cole! Where are you, Mr. Cole?”\\n\\nI moved over to the locked door. My hand found the key. I turned round\\nwith evil triumph in my heart, and God knows what upon my face. Rattray\\ndid not move. With lifted hands the girl was merely begging him to go by\\nthe door that was open, down the stair. He shook his head grimly. With\\nan oath I was upon them.\\n\\n“Go, both of you!” I whispered hoarsely. “Now--while you can--and I can\\nlet you. Now! Now!”\\n\\nStill Rattray hung back.\\n\\nI saw him glancing wistfully at my great revolver lying on the table\\nunder the lamp. I thrust it upon him, and pushed him towards the door.\\n\\n“You go first. She shall follow. You will not grudge me one last word?\\nYes, I will take your hand. If you escape--be good to her!”\\n\\nHe was gone. Without, there was a voice still calling me; but now it\\nsounded overhead.\\n\\n“Good-by, Eva,” I said. “You have not a moment to lose.”\\n\\nYet those divine eyes lingered on my ugliness.\\n\\n“You are in a very great hurry,” said she, in the sharp little voice of\\nher bitter moments.\\n\\n“You love him; that is enough.”\\n\\n“And you, too!” she cried. “And you, too!”\\n\\nAnd her pure, warm arms were round my neck; another instant, and she\\nwould have kissed me, she! I know it. I knew it then. But it was more\\nthan I would bear. As a brother! I had heard that tale before. Back I\\nstepped again, all the man in me rebelling.\\n\\n“That's impossible,” said I rudely.\\n\\n“It isn't. It's true. I do love you--for this!”\\n\\nGod knows how I looked!\\n\\n“And I mayn't say good-by to you,” she whispered. “And--and I love\\nyou--for that!”\\n\\n“Then you had better choose between us,” said I.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX. THE STATEMENT OF FRANCIS RATTRAY\\n\\n\\nIn the year 1858 I received a bulky packet bearing the stamp of the\\nArgentine Republic, a realm in which, to the best of my belief, I had\\nnot a solitary acquaintance. The superscription told me nothing. In\\nmy relations with Rattray his handwriting had never come under my\\nobservation. Judge then of my feelings when the first thing I read was\\nhis signature at the foot of the last page.\\n\\nFor five years I had been uncertain whether he was alive or dead. I had\\nheard nothing of him from the night we parted in Kirby Hall. All I knew\\nwas that he had escaped from England and the English police; his letter\\ngave no details of the incident. It was an astonishing letter; my breath\\nwas taken on the first close page; at the foot of it the tears were in\\nmy eyes. And all that part I must pass over without a word. I have never\\nshown it to man or woman. It is sacred between man and man.\\n\\nBut the letter possessed other points of interest--of almost universal\\ninterest--to which no such scruples need apply; for it cleared up\\ncertain features of the foregoing narrative which had long been\\nmysteries to all the world; and it gave me what I had tried in vain\\nto fathom all these years, some explanation, or rather history, of\\nthe young Lancastrian's complicity with Joaquin Santos in the foul\\nenterprise of the Lady Jermyn. And these passages I shall reproduce word\\nfor word; partly because of their intrinsic interest; partly for such\\nnew light as they day throw on this or that phase of the foregoing\\nnarrative; and, lastly, out of fairness to (I hope) the most gallant and\\nmost generous youth who ever slipped upon the lower slopes of Avemus.\\n\\nWrote Rattray:\\n\\n“You wondered how I could have thrown in my lot with such a man. You may\\nwonder still, for I never yet told living soul. I pretended I had joined\\nhim of my own free will. That was not quite the case. The facts were as\\nfollows:\\n\\n“In my teens (as I think you know) I was at sea. I took my second mate's\\ncertificate at twenty, and from that to twenty-four my voyages were far\\nbetween and on my own account. I had given way to our hereditary passion\\nfor smuggling. I kept a 'yacht' in Morecambe Bay, and more French brandy\\nthan I knew what to do with in my cellars. It was exciting for a time,\\nbut the excitement did not last. In 1851 the gold fever broke out in\\nAustralia. I shipped to Melbourne as third mate on a barque, and\\nI deserted for the diggings in the usual course. But I was never a\\nsuccessful digger. I had little luck and less patience, and I have no\\ndoubt that many a good haul has been taken out of claims previously\\nabandoned by me; for of one or two I had the mortification of hearing\\nwhile still in the Colony. I suppose I had not the temperament for the\\nwork. Dust would not do for me--I must have nuggets. So from Bendigo I\\ndrifted to the Ovens, and from the Ovens to Ballarat. But I did no more\\ngood on one field than on another, and eventually, early in 1853, I cast\\nup in Melbourne again with the intention of shipping home in the first\\nvessel. But there were no crews for the homeward-bounders, and while\\nwaiting for a ship my little stock of gold dust gave out. I became\\ndestitute first--then desperate. Unluckily for me, the beginning of '53\\nwas the hey-day of Captain Melville, the notorious bushranger. He was\\na young fellow of my own age. I determined to imitate his exploits. I\\ncould make nothing out there from an honest life; rather than starve\\nI would lead a dishonest one. I had been born with lawless tendencies;\\nfrom smuggling to bushranging was an easy transition, and about the\\nlatter there seemed to be a gallantry and romantic swagger which put it\\non the higher plane of the two. But I was not born to be a bushranger\\neither. I failed at the very first attempt. I was outwitted by my first\\nvictim, a thin old gentleman riding a cob at night on the Geelong road.\\n\\n“'Why rob me?' said he. 'I have only ten pounds in my pocket, and the\\npunishment will be the same as though it were ten thousand.'\\n\\n“'I want your cob,' said I (for I was on foot); 'I'm a starving Jack,\\nand as I can't get a ship I'm going to take to the bush.'\\n\\n“He shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“'To starve there?' said he. 'My friend, it is a poor sport, this\\nbushranging. I have looked into the matter on my own account. You not\\nonly die like a dog, but you live like one too. It is not worth while.\\nNo crime is worth while under five figures, my friend. A starving Jack,\\neh? Instead of robbing me of ten pounds, why not join me and take ten\\nthousand as your share of our first robbery? A sailor is the very man I\\nwant!'\\n\\n“I told him that what I wanted was his cob, and that it was no use his\\ntrying to hoodwink me by pretending he was one of my sort, because I\\nknew very well that he was not; at which he shrugged again, and slowly\\ndismounted, after offering me his money, of which I took half. He shook\\nhis head, telling me I was very foolish, and I was coolly mounting (for\\nhe had never offered me the least resistance), with my pistols in my\\nbelt, when suddenly I heard one cocked behind me.\\n\\n“'Stop!' said he. 'It's my turn! Stop, or I shoot you dead!' The tables\\nwere turned, and he had me at his mercy as completely as he had been at\\nmine. I made up my mind to being marched to the nearest police-station.\\nBut nothing of the kind. I had misjudged my man as utterly as you\\nmisjudged him a few months later aboard the Lady Jermyn. He took me\\nto his house on the outskirts of Melbourne, a weather-board bungalow,\\nscantily furnished, but comfortable enough. And there he seriously\\nrepeated the proposal he had made me off-hand in the road. Only he put\\nit a little differently. Would I go to the hulks for attempting to rob\\nhim of five pounds, or would I stay and help him commit a robbery, of\\nwhich my share alone would be ten or fifteen thousand? You know which\\nI chose. You know who this man was. I said I would join him. He made me\\nswear it. And then he told me what his enterprise was: there is no need\\nfor me to tell you; nor indeed had it taken definite shape at this time.\\nSuffice it that Santos had wind that big consignments of Austrailian\\ngold were shortly to be shipped home to England; that he, like myself,\\nhad done nothing on the diggings, where he had looked to make his\\nfortune, and out of which he meant to make it still.\\n\\n“It was an extraordinary life that we led in the bungalow, I the guest,\\nhe the host, and Eva the unsuspecting hostess and innocent daughter\\nof the house. Santos had failed on the fields, but he had succeeded in\\nmaking valuable friends in Melbourne. Men of position and of influence\\nspent their evenings on our veranda, among others the Melbourne agent\\nfor the Lady Jermyn, the likeliest vessel then lying in the harbor, and\\nthe one to which the first consignment of gold-dust would be entrusted\\nif only a skipper could be found to replace the deserter who took\\nyou out. Santos made up his mind to find one. It took him weeks, but\\neventually he found Captain Harris on Bendigo, and Captain Harris was\\nhis man. More than that he was the man for the agent; and the Lady\\nJermyn was once more made ready for sea.\\n\\n“Now began the complications. Quite openly, Santos had bought the\\nschooner Spindrift, freighted her with wool, given me the command, and\\nvowed that he would go home in her rather than wait any longer for the\\nLady Jermyn. At the last moment he appeared to change his mind, and I\\nsailed alone as many days as possible in advance of the ship, as had\\nbeen intended from the first; but it went sorely against the grain when\\nthe time came. I would have given anything to have backed out of the\\nenterprise. Honest I might be no longer; I was honestly in love with Eva\\nDenison. Yet to have backed out would have been one way of losing her\\nfor ever. Besides, it was not the first time I had run counter to the\\nlaw, I who came of a lawless stock; but it would be the first time I had\\ndeserted a comrade or broken faith with one. I would do neither. In for\\na penny, in for a pound.\\n\\n“But before my God I never meant it to turn out as it did; though I\\nadmit and have always admitted that my moral responsibility is but\\nlittle if any the less on that account. Yet I was never a consenting\\nparty to wholesale murder, whatever else I was. The night before I\\nsailed, Santos and the captain were aboard with me till the small hours.\\nThey promised me that every soul should have every chance; that nothing\\nbut unforeseen accident could prevent the boats from making Ascension\\nagain in a matter of hours; that as long as the gig was supposed to be\\nlost with all hands, nothing else mattered. So they promised, and that\\nHarris meant to keep his promise I fully believe. That was not a wanton\\nruffian; but the other would spill blood like water, as I told you at\\nthe hall, and as no man now knows better than yourself. He was notorious\\neven in Portuguese Africa on account of his atrocious treatment of the\\nblacks. It was a favorite boast of his that he once poisoned a whole\\nvillage; and that he himself tampered with the Lady Jermyn's boats you\\ncan take my word, for I have heard him describe how he left it to the\\nlast night, and struck the blows during the applause at the concert on\\nthe quarter-deck. He said it might have come out about the gold in the\\ngig, during the fire. It was safer to run no risks.\\n\\n“The same thing came into play aboard the schooner. Never shall I forget\\nthe horror of that voyage after Santos came aboard! I had a crew of\\neight hands all told, and two he brought with him in the gig. Of course\\nthey began talking about the gold; they would have their share or split\\nwhen they got ashore; and there was mutiny in the air, with the steward\\nand the quarter-master of the Lady Jermyn for ring-leaders. Santos\\nnipped it in the bud with a vengeance! He and Harris shot every man\\nof them dead, and two who were shot through the heart they washed and\\ndressed and set adrift to rot in the gig with false papers! God knows\\nhow we made Madeira; we painted the old name out and a new name in, on\\nthe way; and we shipped a Portuguese crew, not a man of whom could speak\\nEnglish. We shipped them aboard the Duque de Mondejo's yacht Braganza;\\nthe schooner Spindrift had disappeared from the face of the waters for\\never. And with the men we took in plenty of sour claret and cigarettes;\\nand we paid them well; and the Portuguese sailor is not inquisitive\\nunder such conditions.\\n\\n“And now, honestly, I wished I had put a bullet through my head before\\njoining in this murderous conspiracy; but retreat was impossible, even\\nif I had been the man to draw back after going so far; and I had a still\\nstronger reason for standing by the others to the bitter end. I could\\nnot leave our lady to these ruffians. On the other hand, neither could I\\ntake her from them, for (as you know) she justly regarded me as the most\\nflagrant ruffian of them all. It was in me and through me that she was\\ndeceived, insulted, humbled, and contaminated; that she should ever have\\nforgiven me for a moment is more than I can credit or fathom to this\\nhour... So there we were. She would not look at me. And I would not\\nleave her until death removed me. Santos had been kind enough to her\\nhitherto; he had been kind enough (I understand) to her mother before\\nher. It was only in the execution of his plans that he showed his\\nNapoleonic disregard for human life; and it was precisely herein that\\nI began to fear for the girl I still dared to love. She took up an\\nattitude as dangerous to her safety as to our own. She demanded to be\\nset free when we came to land. Her demand was refused. God forgive me,\\nit had no bitterer opponent than myself! And all we did was to harden\\nher resolution; that mere child threatened us to our faces, never shall\\nI forget the scene! You know her spirit: if we would not set her free,\\nshe would tell all when we landed. And you remember how Santos used to\\nshrug? That was all he did then. It was enough for me who knew him. For\\ndays I never left them alone together. Night after night I watched her\\ncabin door. And she hated me the more for never leaving her alone! I had\\nto resign myself to that.\\n\\n“The night we anchored in Falmouth Bay, thinking then of taking our gold\\nstraight to the Bank of England, as eccentric lucky diggers--that night\\nI thought would be the last for one or other of us. He locked her in\\nher cabin. He posted himself outside on the settee. I sat watching him\\nacross the table. Each had a hand in his pocket, each had a pistol in\\nthat hand, and there we sat, with our four eyes locked, while Harris\\nwent ashore for papers. He came back in great excitement. What with\\nstopping at Madeira, and calms, and the very few knots we could knock\\nout of the schooner at the best of times, we had made a seven or eight\\nweeks' voyage of it from Ascension--where, by the way, I had arrived\\nonly a couple of days before the Lady Jermyn, though I had nearly a\\nmonth's start of her. Well, Harris came back in the highest state of\\nexcitement: and well he might: the papers were full of you, and of the\\nburning of the Lady Jermyn!\\n\\n“Now mark what happened. You know, of course, as well as I do; but I\\nwonder if you can even yet realize what it was to us! Our prisoner\\nhears that you are alive, and she turns upon Santos and tells him he is\\nwelcome to silence her, but it will do us ne good now, as you know that\\nthe ship was wilfully burned, and with what object. It is the single\\nblow she can strike in self-defence; but a shrewder one could scarcely\\nbe imagined. She had talked to you, at the very last; and by that time\\nshe did know the truth. What more natural than that she should confide\\nit to you? She had had time to tell you enough to hang the lot of us;\\nand you may imagine our consternation on hearing that she had told you\\nall she knew! From the first we were never quite sure whether to believe\\nit or not. That the papers breathed no suspicion of foul play was\\nneither here nor there. Scotland Yard might have seen to that. Then\\nwe read of the morbid reserve which was said to characterize all your\\nutterances concerning the Lady Jermyn. What were we to do? What we no\\nlonger dared to do was to take our gold-dust straight to the Bank. What\\nwe did, you know.\\n\\n“We ran round to Morecambe Bay, and landed the gold as we Rattrays had\\nlanded lace and brandy from time immemorial. We left Eva in charge of\\nJane Braithwaite, God only knows how much against my will, but we were\\nin a corner, it was life or death with us, and to find out how much you\\nknew was a first plain necessity. And the means we took were the only\\nmeans in our power; nor shall I say more to you on that subject than I\\nsaid five years ago in my poor old house. That is still the one part of\\nthe whole conspiracy of which I myself am most ashamed.\\n\\n“And now it only remains for me to tell you why I have written all this\\nto you, at such great length, so long after the event. My wife wished\\nit. The fact is that she wants you to think better of me than I deserve;\\nand I--yes--I confess that I should like you not to think quite as ill\\nof me as you must have done all these years. I was villain enough, but\\ndo not think I am unpunished.\\n\\n“I am an outlaw from my country. I am morally a transported felon. Only\\nin this no-man's land am I a free man; let me but step across the border\\nand I am worth a little fortune to the man who takes me. And we have had\\na hard time here, though not so hard as I deserved; and the hardest part\\nof all...”\\n\\nBut you must guess the hardest part: for the letter ended as it began,\\nwith sudden talk of his inner life, and tentative inquiry after mine. In\\nits entirety, as I say, I have never shown it to a soul; there was just\\na little more that I read to my wife (who could not hear enough about\\nhis); then I folded up the letter, and even she has never seen the\\npassages to which I allude.\\n\\nAnd yet I am not one of those who hold that the previous romances\\nof married people should be taboo between them in after life. On the\\ncontrary, much mutual amusement, of an innocent character, may be\\nderived from a fair and free interchange upon the subject; and this is\\nwhy we, in our old age (or rather in mine), find a still unfailing topic\\nin the story of which Eva Denison was wayward heroine and Frank Rattray\\nthe nearest approach to a hero. Sometimes these reminiscences lead to\\nan argument; for it has been the fate of my life to become attached to\\nargumentative persons. I suppose because I myself hate arguing. On\\nthe day that I received Rattray's letter we had one of our warmest\\ndiscussions. I could repeat every word of it after forty years.\\n\\n“A good man does not necessarily make a good husband,” I innocently\\nremarked.\\n\\n“Why do you say that?” asked my wife, who never would let a\\ngeneralization pass unchallenged.\\n\\n“I was thinking of Rattray,” said I. “The most tolerant of judges could\\nscarcely have described him as a good man five years ago. Yet I can see\\nthat he has made an admirable husband. On the whole, and if you can't be\\nboth, it is better to be the good husband!”\\n\\nIt was this point that we debated with so much ardor. My wife would take\\nthe opposite side; that is her one grave fault. And I must introduce\\npersonalities; that, of course, is among the least of mine. I compared\\nmyself with Rattray, as a husband, and (with some sincerity) to my own\\ndisparagement. I pointed out that he was an infinitely more fascinating\\ncreature, which was no hard saying, for that epithet at least I have\\nnever earned. And yet it was the word to sting my wife.\\n\\n“Fascinating, perhaps!” said she. “Yes, that is the very word;\\nbut--fascination is not love!”\\n\\nAnd then I went to her, and stroked her hair (for she had hung her head\\nin deep distress), and kissed the tears from her eyes. And I swore that\\nher eyes were as lovely as Eva Denison's, that there seemed even more\\ngold in her glossy brown hair, that she was even younger to look at. And\\nat the last and craftiest compliment my own love looked at me through\\nher tears, as though some day or other she might forgive me.\\n\\n“Then why did you want to give me up to him?” said she.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeffCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n(_Kept in shorthand._)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at\\nVienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an\\nhour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I\\ngot of it from the train and the little I could walk through the\\nstreets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived\\nlate and would start as near the correct time as possible. The\\nimpression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the\\nEast; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is\\nhere of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish\\nrule.\\n\\n\\nWe left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.\\nHere I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or\\nrather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was\\nvery good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the\\nwaiter, and he said it was called \"paprika hendl,\" and that, as it was a\\nnational dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the\\nCarpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I\\ndon\\'t know how I should be able to get on without it.\\n\\n\\nHaving had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the\\nBritish Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library\\nregarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the\\ncountry could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a\\nnobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the\\nextreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,\\nTransylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian\\nmountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was\\nnot able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the\\nCastle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare\\nwith our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post\\ntown named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter\\nhere some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my\\ntravels with Mina.\\n\\n\\nIn the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:\\nSaxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the\\ndescendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the\\nEast and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended\\nfrom Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered\\nthe country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I\\nread that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the\\nhorseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of\\nimaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I\\nmust ask the Count all about them.)\\n\\n\\nI did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had\\nall sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my\\nwindow, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been\\nthe paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was\\nstill thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous\\nknocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.\\nI had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour\\nwhich they said was \"mamaliga,\" and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a\\nvery excellent dish, which they call \"impletata.\" (_Mem._, get recipe\\nfor this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little\\nbefore eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to\\nthe station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour\\nbefore we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the\\nmore unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?\\n\\n\\nAll day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of\\nbeauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the\\ntop of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by\\nrivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side\\nof them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and\\nrunning strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every\\nstation there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts\\nof attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I\\nsaw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats\\nand home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women\\nlooked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy\\nabout the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,\\nand most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something\\nfluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there\\nwere petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the\\nSlovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy\\nhats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous\\nheavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass\\nnails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and\\nhad long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very\\npicturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be\\nset down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,\\nhowever, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural\\nself-assertion.\\n\\n\\nIt was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a\\nvery interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the\\nBorgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy\\nexistence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series\\nof great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate\\noccasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent\\na siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war\\nproper being assisted by famine and disease.\\n\\n\\nCount Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I\\nfound, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of\\ncourse I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was\\nevidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a\\ncheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white\\nundergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff\\nfitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and\\nsaid, \"The Herr Englishman?\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"Jonathan Harker.\" She\\nsmiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,\\nwho had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with\\na letter:--\\n\\n\\n     \"My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting\\n     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will\\n     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo\\n     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust\\n     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you\\n     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.\\n\\n\\n\"Your friend,\\n\\n\\n\"DRACULA.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,\\ndirecting him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on\\nmaking inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and\\npretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be\\ntrue, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he\\nanswered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old\\nlady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of\\nway. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that\\nwas all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could\\ntell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,\\nand, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak\\nfurther. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask\\nany one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means\\ncomforting.\\n\\n\\nJust before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a\\nvery hysterical way:\\n\\n\\n\"Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?\" She was in such an excited\\nstate that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and\\nmixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I\\nwas just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her\\nthat I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,\\nshe asked again:\\n\\n\\n\"Do you know what day it is?\" I answered that it was the fourth of May.\\nShe shook her head as she said again:\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?\" On\\nmy saying that I did not understand, she went on:\\n\\n\\n\"It is the eve of St. George\\'s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when\\nthe clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have\\nfull sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?\"\\nShe was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but\\nwithout effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not\\nto go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very\\nridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business\\nto be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore\\ntried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked\\nher, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and\\ndried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I\\ndid not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been\\ntaught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it\\nseemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a\\nstate of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the\\nrosary round my neck, and said, \"For your mother\\'s sake,\" and went out\\nof the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting\\nfor the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still\\nround my neck. Whether it is the old lady\\'s fear, or the many ghostly\\ntraditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I\\nam not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should\\never reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the\\ncoach!\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is\\nhigh over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or\\nhills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are\\nmixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,\\nnaturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put\\ndown, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I\\nleft Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they\\ncalled \"robber steak\"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red\\npepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple\\nstyle of the London cat\\'s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which\\nproduces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not\\ndisagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.\\n\\n\\nWhen I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him\\ntalking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every\\nnow and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting\\non the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning\\n\"word-bearer\"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them\\npityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for\\nthere were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot\\ndictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not\\ncheering to me, for amongst them were \"Ordog\"--Satan, \"pokol\"--hell,\\n\"stregoica\"--witch, \"vrolok\" and \"vlkoslak\"--both of which mean the same\\nthing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is\\neither were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these\\nsuperstitions)\\n\\n\\nWhen we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time\\nswelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and\\npointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a\\nfellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at\\nfirst, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a\\ncharm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,\\njust starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one\\nseemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I\\ncould not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I\\nhad of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing\\nthemselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of\\nrich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the\\ncentre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered\\nthe whole front of the box-seat--\"gotza\" they call them--cracked his big\\nwhip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on\\nour journey.\\n\\n\\nI soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the\\nscene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather\\nlanguages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have\\nbeen able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping\\nland full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned\\nwith clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the\\nroad. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,\\nplum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under\\nthe trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these\\ngreen hills of what they call here the \"Mittel Land\" ran the road,\\nlosing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the\\nstraggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the\\nhillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we\\nseemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then\\nwhat the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no\\ntime in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime\\nexcellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter\\nsnows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in\\nthe Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept\\nin too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the\\nTurk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,\\nand so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.\\n\\n\\nBeyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes\\nof forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right\\nand left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon\\nthem and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,\\ndeep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where\\ngrass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and\\npointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where\\nthe snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the\\nmountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again\\nthe white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as\\nwe swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered\\npeak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to\\nbe right before us:--\\n\\n\\n\"Look! Isten szek!\"--\"God\\'s seat!\"--and he crossed himself reverently.\\n\\n\\nAs we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind\\nus, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was\\nemphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\\nsunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there\\nwe passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed\\nthat goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,\\nand as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there\\nwas a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even\\nturn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of\\ndevotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were\\nmany things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here\\nand there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems\\nshining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and\\nagain we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant\\'s cart--with its\\nlong, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the\\nroad. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming\\npeasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their\\ncoloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long\\nstaves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,\\nand the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the\\ngloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which\\nran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the\\nPass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of\\nlate-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods\\nthat seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of\\ngreyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a\\npeculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and\\ngrim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset\\nthrew into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the\\nCarpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the\\nhills were so steep that, despite our driver\\'s haste, the horses could\\nonly go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,\\nbut the driver would not hear of it. \"No, no,\" he said; \"you must not\\nwalk here; the dogs are too fierce\"; and then he added, with what he\\nevidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the\\napproving smile of the rest--\"and you may have enough of such matters\\nbefore you go to sleep.\" The only stop he would make was a moment\\'s\\npause to light his lamps.\\n\\n\\nWhen it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\\npassengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\\nthough urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully\\nwith his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\\nto further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\\npatch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\\nhills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach\\nrocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a\\nstormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared\\nto fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each\\nside and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One\\nby one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed\\nupon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were\\ncertainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good\\nfaith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of\\nfear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at\\nBistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.\\nThen, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the\\npassengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the\\ndarkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either\\nhappening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would\\ngive me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for\\nsome little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on\\nthe eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the\\nair the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the\\nmountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got\\ninto the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance\\nwhich was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the\\nglare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light\\nwas the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our\\nhard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy\\nroad lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.\\nThe passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\\nmy own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when\\nthe driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I\\ncould hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I\\nthought it was \"An hour less than the time.\" Then turning to me, he said\\nin German worse than my own:--\\n\\n\\n\"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will\\nnow come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better\\nthe next day.\" Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and\\nsnort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,\\namongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing\\nof themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook\\nus, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our\\nlamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and\\nsplendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown\\nbeard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I\\ncould only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red\\nin the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--\\n\\n\\n\"You are early to-night, my friend.\" The man stammered in reply:--\\n\\n\\n\"The English Herr was in a hurry,\" to which the stranger replied:--\\n\\n\\n\"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot\\ndeceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.\" As he\\nspoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with\\nvery red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my\\ncompanions whispered to another the line from Burger\\'s \"Lenore\":--\\n\\n\\n    \"Denn die Todten reiten schnell\"--\\n    (\"For the dead travel fast.\")\\n\\n\\nThe strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\\ngleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\\nputting out his two fingers and crossing himself. \"Give me the Herr\\'s\\nluggage,\" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\\nhanded out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the\\ncoach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a\\nhand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been\\nprodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we\\nswept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam\\nfrom the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected\\nagainst it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then\\nthe driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept\\non their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a\\nstrange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown\\nover my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in\\nexcellent German:--\\n\\n\\n\"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all\\ncare of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the\\ncountry) underneath the seat, if you should require it.\" I did not take\\nany, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a\\nlittle strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been\\nany alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that\\nunknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,\\nthen we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It\\nseemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground\\nagain; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was\\nso. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but\\nI really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any\\nprotest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to\\ndelay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was\\npassing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was\\nwithin a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I\\nsuppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my\\nrecent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\\n\\n\\nThen a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a\\nlong, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by\\nanother dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which\\nnow sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed\\nto come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp\\nit through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to\\nstrain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they\\nquieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from\\nsudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each\\nside of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which\\naffected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to\\njump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged\\nmadly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them\\nfrom bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to\\nthe sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able\\nto descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and\\nwhispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers\\ndoing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became\\nquite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again\\ntook his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This\\ntime, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a\\nnarrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.\\n\\n\\nSoon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the\\nroadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning\\nrocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we\\ncould hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the\\nrocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.\\nIt grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,\\nso that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The\\nkeen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew\\nfainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer\\nand nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I\\ngrew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,\\nhowever, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to\\nleft and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\\n\\n\\nSuddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The\\ndriver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,\\njumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know\\nwhat to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while\\nI wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took\\nhis seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep\\nand kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated\\nendlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.\\nOnce the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness\\naround us I could watch the driver\\'s motions. He went rapidly to where\\nthe blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem\\nto illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,\\nformed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical\\neffect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,\\nfor I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but\\nas the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me\\nstraining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue\\nflames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the\\nwolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.\\n\\n\\nAt last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\\nhad yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse\\nthan ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause\\nfor it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just\\nthen the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the\\njagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw\\naround us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,\\nwith long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more\\nterrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.\\nFor myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man\\nfeels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand\\ntheir true import.\\n\\n\\nAll at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\\nsome peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and\\nlooked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;\\nbut the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they\\nhad perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for\\nit seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the\\nring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the\\ncalèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as\\nto give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know\\nnot, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and\\nlooking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his\\nlong arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves\\nfell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across\\nthe face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.\\n\\n\\nWhen I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the\\nwolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a\\ndreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time\\nseemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete\\ndarkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on\\nascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main\\nalways ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the\\ndriver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a\\nvast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,\\nand whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit\\nsky.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL--_continued_\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully\\nawake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In\\nthe gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark\\nways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than\\nit really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.\\n\\n\\nWhen the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand\\nto assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious\\nstrength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have\\ncrushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed\\nthem on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and\\nstudded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of\\nmassive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was\\nmassively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and\\nweather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the\\nreins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one\\nof the dark openings.\\n\\n\\nI stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell\\nor knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark\\nwindow openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The\\ntime I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon\\nme. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?\\nWhat sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a\\ncustomary incident in the life of a solicitor\\'s clerk sent out to\\nexplain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor\\'s\\nclerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving\\nLondon I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a\\nfull-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if\\nI were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I\\nexpected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with\\nthe dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt\\nin the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the\\npinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake\\nand among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to\\nwait the coming of the morning.\\n\\n\\nJust as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching\\nbehind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming\\nlight. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of\\nmassive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise\\nof long disuse, and the great door swung back.\\n\\n\\nWithin, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white\\nmoustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck\\nof colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver\\nlamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,\\nthrowing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the\\nopen door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly\\ngesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--\\n\\n\\n\"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!\" He made no\\nmotion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his\\ngesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that\\nI had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and\\nholding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,\\nan effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as\\nice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the\\nhappiness you bring!\" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to\\nthat which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that\\nfor a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was\\nspeaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--\\n\\n\\n\"Count Dracula?\" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--\\n\\n\\n\"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;\\nthe night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.\" As he was\\nspeaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,\\ntook my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I\\nprotested but he insisted:--\\n\\n\\n\"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not\\navailable. Let me see to your comfort myself.\" He insisted on carrying\\nmy traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and\\nalong another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang\\nheavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced\\nto see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,\\nand on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,\\nflamed and flared.\\n\\n\\nThe Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing\\nthe room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit\\nby a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing\\nthrough this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a\\nwelcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with\\nanother log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were\\nfresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself\\nleft my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the\\ndoor:--\\n\\n\\n\"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your\\ntoilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come\\ninto the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.\"\\n\\n\\nThe light and warmth and the Count\\'s courteous welcome seemed to have\\ndissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,\\nI discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty\\ntoilet, I went into the other room.\\n\\n\\nI found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the\\ngreat fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of\\nhis hand to the table, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse\\nme that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.\"\\n\\n\\nI handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.\\nHe opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed\\nit to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of\\npleasure.\\n\\n\\n\"I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant\\nsufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to\\ncome; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in\\nwhom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy\\nand talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is\\ndiscreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall\\nbe ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take\\nyour instructions in all matters.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I\\nfell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese\\nand a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was\\nmy supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many\\nquestions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had\\nexperienced.\\n\\n\\nBy this time I had finished my supper, and by my host\\'s desire had drawn\\nup a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,\\nat the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an\\nopportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked\\nphysiognomy.\\n\\n\\nHis face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the\\nthin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and\\nhair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His\\neyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy\\nhair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I\\ncould see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather\\ncruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over\\nthe lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a\\nman of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops\\nextremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm\\nthough thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.\\n\\n\\nHitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees\\nin the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing\\nthem now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather\\ncoarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in\\nthe centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp\\npoint. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not\\nrepress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a\\nhorrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could\\nnot conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a\\ngrim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his\\nprotuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the\\nfireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the\\nwindow I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a\\nstrange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from\\ndown below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count\\'s eyes\\ngleamed, and he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!\"\\nSeeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he\\nadded:--\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the\\nhunter.\" Then he rose and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you\\nshall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;\\nso sleep well and dream well!\" With a courteous bow, he opened for me\\nhimself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....\\n\\n\\nI am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,\\nwhich I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the\\nsake of those dear to me!\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the\\nlast twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my\\nown accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had\\nsupped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the\\npot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which\\nwas written:--\\n\\n\\n\"I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.\" I set to and\\nenjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I\\nmight let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.\\nThere are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the\\nextraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service\\nis of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.\\nThe curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of\\nmy bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have\\nbeen of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,\\nthough in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,\\nbut there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of\\nthe rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my\\ntable, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I\\ncould either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant\\nanywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.\\nSome time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it\\nbreakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o\\'clock when I had\\nit--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about\\nthe castle until I had asked the Count\\'s permission. There was\\nabsolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing\\nmaterials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of\\nlibrary. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.\\n\\n\\nIn the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English\\nbooks, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and\\nnewspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines\\nand newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books\\nwere of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political\\neconomy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life\\nand customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the\\nLondon Directory, the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" books, Whitaker\\'s Almanac, the\\nArmy and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the\\nLaw List.\\n\\n\\nWhilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count\\nentered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good\\nnight\\'s rest. Then he went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that\\nwill interest you. These companions\"--and he laid his hand on some of\\nthe books--\"have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever\\nsince I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours\\nof pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to\\nknow her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of\\nyour mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of\\nhumanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes\\nit what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.\\nTo you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But, Count,\" I said, \"you know and speak English thoroughly!\" He bowed\\ngravely.\\n\\n\\n\"I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I\\nfear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know\\nthe grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" I said, \"you speak excellently.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Not so,\" he answered. \"Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your\\nLondon, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not\\nenough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,\\nand I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men\\nknow him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am\\nlike the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his\\nspeaking if he hear my words, \\'Ha, ha! a stranger!\\' I have been so long\\nmaster that I would be master still--or at least that none other should\\nbe master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter\\nHawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You\\nshall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may\\nlearn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make\\nerror, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be\\naway so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many\\nimportant affairs in hand.\"\\n\\n\\nOf course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might\\ncome into that room when I chose. He answered: \"Yes, certainly,\" and\\nadded:--\\n\\n\\n\"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are\\nlocked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that\\nall things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with\\nmy knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.\" I said I was sure of\\nthis, and then he went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are\\nnot your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from\\nwhat you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of\\nwhat strange things there may be.\"\\n\\n\\nThis led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to\\ntalk, if only for talking\\'s sake, I asked him many questions regarding\\nthings that had already happened to me or come within my notice.\\nSometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by\\npretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most\\nfrankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked\\nhim of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for\\ninstance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue\\nflames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a\\ncertain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits\\nare supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place\\nwhere treasure has been concealed. \"That treasure has been hidden,\" he\\nwent on, \"in the region through which you came last night, there can be\\nbut little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the\\nWallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil\\nin all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,\\npatriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the\\nAustrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out\\nto meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited\\ntheir coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep\\ndestruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader\\nwas triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been\\nsheltered in the friendly soil.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But how,\" said I, \"can it have remained so long undiscovered, when\\nthere is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?\"\\nThe Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,\\nsharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--\\n\\n\\n\"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only\\nappear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he\\ncan help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he\\nwould not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who\\nmarked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight\\neven for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to\\nfind these places again?\"\\n\\n\\n\"There you are right,\" I said. \"I know no more than the dead where even\\nto look for them.\" Then we drifted into other matters.\\n\\n\\n\"Come,\" he said at last, \"tell me of London and of the house which you\\nhave procured for me.\" With an apology for my remissness, I went into my\\nown room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in\\norder I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I\\npassed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp\\nlit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit\\nin the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,\\nreading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw\\'s Guide. When I\\ncame in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I\\nwent into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in\\neverything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its\\nsurroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the\\nsubject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much\\nmore than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--\\n\\n\\n\"Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there\\nI shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I\\nfall into my country\\'s habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend\\nJonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be\\nin Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my\\nother friend, Peter Hawkins. So!\"\\n\\n\\nWe went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at\\nPurfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the\\nnecessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to\\nMr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a\\nplace. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I\\ninscribe here:--\\n\\n\\n\"At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to\\nbe required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place\\nwas for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,\\nbuilt of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of\\nyears. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with\\nrust.\\n\\n\\n\"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre\\nFace_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of\\nthe compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by\\nthe solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which\\nmake it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or\\nsmall lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and\\nflows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all\\nperiods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone\\nimmensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with\\niron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or\\nchurch. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading\\nto it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from\\nvarious points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling\\nway, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must\\nbe very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very\\nlarge house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic\\nasylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen I had finished, he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to\\nlive in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a\\nday; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice\\nalso that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love\\nnot to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not\\ngaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and\\nsparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;\\nand my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not\\nattuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the\\nshadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken\\nbattlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would\\nbe alone with my thoughts when I may.\" Somehow his words and his look\\ndid not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his\\nsmile look malignant and saturnine.\\n\\n\\nPresently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers\\ntogether. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of\\nthe books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at\\nEngland, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in\\ncertain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed\\nthat one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new\\nestate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the\\nYorkshire coast.\\n\\n\\nIt was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. \"Aha!\" he\\nsaid; \"still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I\\nam informed that your supper is ready.\" He took my arm, and we went into\\nthe next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The\\nCount again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from\\nhome. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.\\nAfter supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with\\nme, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour\\nafter hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not\\nsay anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host\\'s wishes in\\nevery way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified\\nme; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at\\nthe coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.\\nThey say that people who are near death die generally at the change to\\nthe dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and\\ntied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere\\ncan well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up\\nwith preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count\\nDracula, jumping to his feet, said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so\\nlong. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of\\nEngland less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by\\nus,\" and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.\\n\\n\\nI went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to\\nnotice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the\\nwarm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have\\nwritten of this day.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too\\ndiffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for\\nthere is something so strange about this place and all in it that I\\ncannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had\\nnever come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on\\nme; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I\\ncould bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,\\nand he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let\\nme be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and\\nimagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say\\nat once how I stand--or seem to.\\n\\n\\nI only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could\\nnot sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,\\nand was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,\\nand heard the Count\\'s voice saying to me, \"Good-morning.\" I started, for\\nit amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass\\ncovered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,\\nbut did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count\\'s\\nsalutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.\\nThis time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I\\ncould see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in\\nthe mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no\\nsign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on\\nthe top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague\\nfeeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at\\nthe instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was\\ntrickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half\\nround to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his\\neyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at\\nmy throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which\\nheld the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed\\nso quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\\n\\n\\n\"Take care,\" he said, \"take care how you cut yourself. It is more\\ndangerous than you think in this country.\" Then seizing the shaving\\nglass, he went on: \"And this is the wretched thing that has done the\\nmischief. It is a foul bauble of man\\'s vanity. Away with it!\" and\\nopening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung\\nout the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones\\nof the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very\\nannoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or\\nthe bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.\\n\\n\\nWhen I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could\\nnot find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that\\nas yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very\\npeculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I\\nwent out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The\\nview was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity\\nof seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A\\nstone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without\\ntouching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree\\ntops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and\\nthere are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through\\nthe forests.\\n\\n\\nBut I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I\\nexplored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and\\nbolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there\\nan available exit.\\n\\n\\nThe castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL--_continued_\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.\\nI rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of\\nevery window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my\\nhelplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a\\nfew hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much\\nas a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me\\nthat I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done\\nanything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I\\nam thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of\\none thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to\\nthe Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it\\nhimself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive\\nme if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only\\nplan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes\\nopen. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,\\nor else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and\\nshall need, all my brains to get through.\\n\\n\\nI had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below\\nshut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into\\nthe library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making\\nthe bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along\\nthought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him\\nthrough the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the\\ndining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these\\nmenial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.\\nThis gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it\\nmust have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that\\nbrought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it\\nmean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his\\nhand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the\\ncoach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the\\ncrucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless\\nthat good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a\\ncomfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing\\nwhich I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous\\nshould in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there\\nis something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,\\na tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some\\ntime, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my\\nmind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count\\nDracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of\\nhimself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,\\nhowever, not to awake his suspicion.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few\\nquestions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject\\nwonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of\\nbattles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he\\nafterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house\\nand name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their\\nfate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said \"we,\"\\nand spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put\\ndown all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most\\nfascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He\\ngrew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great\\nwhite moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as\\nthough he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I\\nshall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of\\nhis race:--\\n\\n\\n\"We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood\\nof many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,\\nin the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from\\nIceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their\\nBerserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,\\nand of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the\\nwere-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found\\nthe Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,\\ntill the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those\\nold witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the\\ndesert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as\\nAttila, whose blood is in these veins?\" He held up his arms. \"Is it a\\nwonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the\\nMagyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his\\nthousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when\\nArpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us\\nhere when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed\\nthere? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were\\nclaimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries\\nwas trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more\\nthan that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,\\n\\'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.\\' Who more gladly than we\\nthroughout the Four Nations received the \\'bloody sword,\\' or at its\\nwarlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was\\nredeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the\\nflags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who\\nwas it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat\\nthe Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that\\nhis own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the\\nTurk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,\\nindeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and\\nagain brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,\\nwhen he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had\\nto come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being\\nslaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They\\nsaid that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants\\nwithout a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to\\nconduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the\\nHungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for\\nour spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the\\nSzekelys--and the Dracula as their heart\\'s blood, their brains, and\\ntheir swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the\\nHapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.\\nBlood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and\\nthe glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.\"\\n\\n\\nIt was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, this\\ndiary seems horribly like the beginning of the \"Arabian Nights,\" for\\neverything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet\\'s\\nfather.)\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by\\nbooks and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not\\nconfuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own\\nobservation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from\\nhis room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the\\ndoing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over\\nbooks, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the\\nmatters I had been examining at Lincoln\\'s Inn. There was a certain\\nmethod in the Count\\'s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in\\nsequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.\\n\\n\\nFirst, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I\\ntold him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be\\nwise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only\\none could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate\\nagainst his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to\\nask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to\\nattend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case\\nlocal help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking\\nsolicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any\\nchance mislead him, so he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under\\nthe shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from\\nLondon, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now\\nhere let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have\\nsought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one\\nresident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be\\nserved save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,\\nhave some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to\\nseek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose\\nI, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or\\nDurham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more\\nease be done by consigning to one in these ports?\" I answered that\\ncertainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of\\nagency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on\\ninstruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing\\nhimself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by\\nhim without further trouble.\\n\\n\\n\"But,\" said he, \"I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Of course,\" I replied; and \"such is often done by men of business, who\\ndo not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Good!\" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making\\nconsignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of\\ndifficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded\\nagainst. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,\\nand he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a\\nwonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or\\nforesee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not\\nevidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were\\nwonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had\\nspoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books\\navailable, he suddenly stood up and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter\\nHawkins, or to any other?\" It was with some bitterness in my heart that\\nI answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of\\nsending letters to anybody.\\n\\n\\n\"Then write now, my young friend,\" he said, laying a heavy hand on my\\nshoulder: \"write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will\\nplease you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Do you wish me to stay so long?\" I asked, for my heart grew cold at the\\nthought.\\n\\n\\n\"I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,\\nemployer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,\\nit was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not\\nstinted. Is it not so?\"\\n\\n\\nWhat could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins\\'s interest, not\\nmine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count\\nDracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing\\nwhich made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I\\ncould have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his\\nmastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but\\nin his own smooth, resistless way:--\\n\\n\\n\"I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things\\nother than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your\\nfriends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting\\nhome to them. Is it not so?\" As he spoke he handed me three sheets of\\nnote-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign\\npost, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,\\nwith the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood\\nas well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for\\nhe would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes\\nnow, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for\\nto her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he\\ndid see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a\\nbook whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to\\nsome books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his\\nown, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door\\nhad closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which\\nwere face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for\\nunder the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way\\nI could.\\n\\n\\nOne of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The\\nCrescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to\\nCoutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,\\nbankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just\\nabout to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my\\nseat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and\\nto resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his\\nhand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped\\nthem carefully, and then turning to me, said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this\\nevening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.\" At the door he\\nturned, and after a moment\\'s pause said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all\\nseriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any\\nchance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has\\nmany memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be\\nwarned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then\\nhaste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be\\nsafe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then\"--He finished his\\nspeech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were\\nwashing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any\\ndream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom\\nand mystery which seemed closing around me.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no\\ndoubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is\\nnot. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that\\nmy rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.\\n\\n\\nWhen he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any\\nsound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out\\ntowards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,\\ninaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness\\nof the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in\\nprison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of\\nthe night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.\\nIt is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all\\nsorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my\\nterrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful\\nexpanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as\\nday. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows\\nin the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed\\nto cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I\\nleaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey\\nbelow me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of\\nthe rooms, that the windows of the Count\\'s own room would look out. The\\nwindow at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though\\nweatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since\\nthe case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked\\ncarefully out.\\n\\n\\nWhat I saw was the Count\\'s head coming out from the window. I did not\\nsee the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his\\nback and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had\\nso many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and\\nsomewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest\\nand amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to\\nrepulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the\\nwindow and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,\\n_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At\\nfirst I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the\\nmoonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could\\nbe no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the\\nstones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus\\nusing every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable\\nspeed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.\\n\\n\\nWhat manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the\\nsemblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering\\nme; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am\\nencompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.\\nHe moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good\\ndeal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head\\nhad disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without\\navail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I\\nknew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to\\nexplore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and\\ntaking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had\\nexpected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the\\nstone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could\\npull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the\\ndoor was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count\\'s\\nroom; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and\\nescape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs\\nand passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two\\nsmall rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in\\nthem except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,\\nhowever, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it\\nseemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,\\nand found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came\\nfrom the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door\\nrested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have\\nagain, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that\\nI could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right\\nthan the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could\\nsee that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the\\nwindows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter\\nside, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle\\nwas built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was\\nquite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or\\nbow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,\\nimpossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the\\nwest was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged\\nmountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with\\nmountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and\\ncrannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle\\noccupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of\\ncomfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the\\nyellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to\\nsee even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over\\nall and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My\\nlamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was\\nglad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place\\nwhich chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better\\nthan living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the\\npresence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I\\nfound a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak\\ntable where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much\\nthought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my\\ndiary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is\\nnineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my\\nsenses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own\\nwhich mere \"modernity\" cannot kill.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I\\nam reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.\\nWhilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not\\ngo mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it\\nis maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this\\nhateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I\\ncan look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his\\npurpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way\\nlies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which\\nhave puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant\\nwhen he made Hamlet say:--\\n\\n\\n    \"My tablets! quick, my tablets!\\n    \\'Tis meet that I put it down,\" etc.,\\n\\n\\nfor now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock\\nhad come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.\\nThe habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.\\n\\n\\nThe Count\\'s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens\\nme more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon\\nme. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!\\n\\n\\nWhen I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and\\npen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count\\'s warning came into my mind,\\nbut I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,\\nand with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft\\nmoonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom\\nwhich refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the\\ngloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat\\nand sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for\\ntheir menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great\\ncouch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look\\nat the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for\\nthe dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen\\nasleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly\\nreal--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the\\nmorning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.\\n\\n\\nI was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I\\ncame into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,\\nmy own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of\\ndust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by\\ntheir dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming\\nwhen I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw\\nno shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some\\ntime, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline\\nnoses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be\\nalmost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was\\nfair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes\\nlike pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it\\nin connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the\\nmoment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like\\npearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something\\nabout them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some\\ndeadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would\\nkiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some\\nday it should meet Mina\\'s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.\\nThey whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a\\nsilvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have\\ncome through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,\\ntingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.\\nThe fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her\\non. One said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to\\nbegin.\" The other added:--\\n\\n\\n\"He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.\" I lay quiet,\\nlooking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.\\nThe fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement\\nof her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent\\nthe same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter\\nunderlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.\\n\\n\\nI was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under\\nthe lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply\\ngloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling\\nand repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips\\nlike an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining\\non the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp\\nteeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of\\nmy mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she\\npaused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked\\nher teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the\\nskin of my throat began to tingle as one\\'s flesh does when the hand that\\nis to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,\\nshivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,\\nand the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.\\nI closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating\\nheart.\\n\\n\\nBut at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as\\nlightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his\\nbeing as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I\\nsaw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with\\ngiant\\'s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the\\nwhite teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with\\npassion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to\\nthe demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light\\nin them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His\\nface was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;\\nthe thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar\\nof white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman\\nfrom him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating\\nthem back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the\\nwolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to\\ncut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when\\nI had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware\\nhow you meddle with him, or you\\'ll have to deal with me.\" The fair girl,\\nwith a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--\\n\\n\\n\"You yourself never loved; you never love!\" On this the other women\\njoined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the\\nroom that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure\\nof fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,\\nand said in a soft whisper:--\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it\\nnot so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall\\nkiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work\\nto be done.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Are we to have nothing to-night?\" said one of them, with a low laugh,\\nas she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which\\nmoved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he\\nnodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my\\nears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a\\nhalf-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with\\nhorror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful\\nbag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me\\nwithout my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the\\nmoonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the\\ndim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.\\n\\n\\nThen the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL--_continued_\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must\\nhave carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but\\ncould not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were\\ncertain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by\\nin a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am\\nrigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and\\nmany such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been\\nevidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or\\nanother, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one\\nthing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed\\nme, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I\\nam sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not\\nhave brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this\\nroom, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of\\nsanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who\\nwere--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for\\nI _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the\\nstairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the\\njamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt\\nof the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.\\nI fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in\\nthe suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here\\nwas nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,\\nanother that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the\\nletter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at\\nBistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state\\nof things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I\\nam so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his\\nsuspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and\\nthat I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to\\nprolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a\\nchance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath\\nwhich was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained\\nto me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would\\nensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much\\nimpressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would\\nbe held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my\\nprolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new\\nsuspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked\\nhim what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and\\nthen said:--\\n\\n\\n\"The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June\\n29.\"\\n\\n\\nI know now the span of my life. God help me!\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_28 May._--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to\\nsend word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are\\nencamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of\\nthem in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though\\nallied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands\\nof them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.\\nThey attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and\\ncall themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,\\nsave superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany\\ntongue.\\n\\n\\nI shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them\\nposted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin\\nacquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many\\nsigns, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could\\ntheir spoken language....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nI have written the letters. Mina\\'s is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr.\\nHawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation,\\nbut without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and\\nfrighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the\\nletters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the\\nextent of my knowledge....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nI have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window\\nwith a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The\\nman who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them\\nin his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to\\nread. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nThe Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest\\nvoice as he opened two letters:--\\n\\n\\n\"The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they\\ncome, I shall, of course, take care. See!\"--he must have looked at\\nit--\"one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other\"--here\\nhe caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and\\nthe dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--\"the\\nother is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is\\nnot signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.\" And he calmly held letter\\nand envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he\\nwent on:--\\n\\n\\n\"The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is\\nyours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that\\nunknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?\" He held\\nout the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean\\nenvelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When\\nhe went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later\\nI went over and tried it, and the door was locked.\\n\\n\\nWhen, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his\\ncoming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very\\ncourteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been\\nsleeping, he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I\\nmay not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours\\nto me; but you will sleep, I pray.\" I passed to my room and went to bed,\\nand, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_31 May._--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself\\nwith some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so\\nthat I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a\\nsurprise, again a shock!\\n\\n\\nEvery scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,\\nrelating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that\\nmight be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered\\nawhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my\\nportmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.\\n\\n\\nThe suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and\\nrug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new\\nscheme of villainy....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed\\ncudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding\\nand scraping of horses\\' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.\\nWith joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great\\nleiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of\\neach pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty\\nsheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I\\nran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the\\nmain hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a\\nshock: my door was fastened on the outside.\\n\\n\\nThen I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me\\nstupidly and pointed, but just then the \"hetman\" of the Szgany came out,\\nand seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they\\nlaughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised\\nentreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.\\nThe leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick\\nrope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks\\nhandled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When\\nthey were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the\\nyard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on\\nit for luck, lazily went each to his horse\\'s head. Shortly afterwards, I\\nheard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and\\nlocked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the\\nwinding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I\\nthought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.\\nThe Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of\\nsome kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound\\nas of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some\\nruthless villainy.\\n\\n\\nI had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw\\nsomething coming out of the Count\\'s window. I drew back and watched\\ncarefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to\\nfind that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst\\ntravelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I\\nhad seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,\\nand in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will\\nallow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave\\nevidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own\\nletters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local\\npeople be attributed to me.\\n\\n\\nIt makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up\\nhere, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which\\nis even a criminal\\'s right and consolation.\\n\\n\\nI thought I would watch for the Count\\'s return, and for a long time sat\\ndoggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some\\nquaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were\\nlike the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in\\nclusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of\\nsoothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the\\nembrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more\\nfully the aërial gambolling.\\n\\n\\nSomething made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far\\nbelow in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to\\nring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to\\nthe sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to\\nawake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,\\nand my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I\\nwas becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the\\nmoonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom\\nbeyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom\\nshapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my\\nsenses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were\\nbecoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the\\nthree ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat\\nsafer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp\\nwas burning brightly.\\n\\n\\nWhen a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the\\nCount\\'s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then\\nthere was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a\\nbeating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and\\ncould do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.\\n\\n\\nAs I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a\\nwoman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between\\nthe bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her\\nhands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning\\nagainst a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she\\nthrew herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--\\n\\n\\n\"Monster, give me my child!\"\\n\\n\\nShe threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same\\nwords in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her\\nbreast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant\\nemotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see\\nher, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.\\n\\n\\nSomewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the\\nCount calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be\\nanswered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes\\nhad passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,\\nthrough the wide entrance into the courtyard.\\n\\n\\nThere was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but\\nshort. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.\\n\\n\\nI could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and\\nshe was better dead.\\n\\n\\nWhat shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful\\nthing of night and gloom and fear?\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night\\nhow sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the\\nsun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great\\ngateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me\\nas if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as\\nif it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must\\ntake action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last\\nnight one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal\\nseries which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the\\nearth.\\n\\n\\nLet me not think of it. Action!\\n\\n\\nIt has always been at night-time that I have been molested or\\nthreatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the\\nCount in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that\\nhe may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!\\nBut there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.\\n\\n\\nYes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone\\nwhy may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his\\nwindow. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The\\nchances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk\\nit. At the worst it can only be death; and a man\\'s death is not a\\ncalf\\'s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me\\nin my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and\\nsecond father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have\\ncome safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I\\nwent whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south\\nside, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs\\naround the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,\\nand the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I\\ntook off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down\\nonce, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would\\nnot overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty\\nwell the direction and distance of the Count\\'s window, and made for it\\nas well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did\\nnot feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed\\nridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and\\ntrying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when\\nI bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked\\naround for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.\\nThe room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which\\nseemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same\\nstyle as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked\\nfor the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it\\nanywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one\\ncorner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and\\nHungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as\\nthough it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was\\nless than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,\\nsome jewelled, but all of them old and stained.\\n\\n\\nAt one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I\\ncould not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which\\nwas the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or\\nall my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone\\npassage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,\\nminding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit\\nby loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,\\ntunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the\\nodour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell\\ngrew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood\\najar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently\\nbeen used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were\\nsteps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and\\nthe earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been\\nbrought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for\\nany further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of\\nthe ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the\\nvaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to\\nmy very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments\\nof old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a\\ndiscovery.\\n\\n\\nThere, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a\\npile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I\\ncould not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the\\nglassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all\\ntheir pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of\\nmovement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,\\nand tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain\\nthere long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.\\nBy the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.\\nI thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw\\nthe dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,\\nthough unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and\\nleaving the Count\\'s room by the window, crawled again up the castle\\nwall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried\\nto think....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has\\ntaken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the\\ncastle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,\\nlizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might\\ndestroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man\\'s hand would\\nhave any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared\\nto see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there\\ntill I fell asleep.\\n\\n\\nI was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can\\nlook as he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful\\nEngland, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never\\nmeet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be\\nhere, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the\\nSzgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some\\nSlovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall\\nbear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to\\nBistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle\\nDracula.\" I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.\\nSincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in\\nconnection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--\\n\\n\\n\"Why may I not go to-night?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.\" He smiled,\\nsuch a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick\\nbehind his smoothness. He said:--\\n\\n\\n\"And your baggage?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my\\neyes, it seemed so real:--\\n\\n\\n\"You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is\\nthat which rules our _boyars_: \\'Welcome the coming; speed the parting\\nguest.\\' Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait\\nin my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that\\nyou so suddenly desire it. Come!\" With a stately gravity, he, with the\\nlamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he\\nstopped.\\n\\n\\n\"Hark!\"\\n\\n\\nClose at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the\\nsound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great\\norchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pause\\nof a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back\\nthe ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it\\nopen.\\n\\n\\nTo my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I\\nlooked all round, but could see no key of any kind.\\n\\n\\nAs the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder\\nand angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed\\nfeet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that\\nto struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such\\nallies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door\\ncontinued slowly to open, and only the Count\\'s body stood in the gap.\\nSuddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my\\ndoom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There\\nwas a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and\\nas a last chance I cried out:--\\n\\n\\n\"Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!\" and covered my face with my\\nhands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his\\npowerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged\\nand echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.\\n\\n\\nIn silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went\\nto my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand\\nto me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that\\nJudas in hell might be proud of.\\n\\n\\nWhen I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a\\nwhispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears\\ndeceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--\\n\\n\\n\"Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have\\npatience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!\" There was a low,\\nsweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw\\nwithout the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they\\nall joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.\\n\\n\\nI came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near\\nthe end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am\\ndear!\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this\\ndiary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself\\non my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me\\nready.\\n\\n\\nAt last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning\\nhad come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.\\nWith a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen\\nthat the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands\\nthat trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the\\nmassive bolts.\\n\\n\\nBut the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at\\nthe door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its\\ncasement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the\\nCount.\\n\\n\\nThen a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I\\ndetermined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count\\'s\\nroom. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of\\nevils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled\\ndown the wall, as before, into the Count\\'s room. It was empty, but that\\nwas as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold\\nremained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding\\nstair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well\\nenough where to find the monster I sought.\\n\\n\\nThe great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid\\nwas laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their\\nplaces to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so\\nI raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw\\nsomething which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,\\nbut looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair\\nand moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,\\nand the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than\\never, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the\\ncorners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,\\nburning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches\\nunderneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were\\nsimply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his\\nrepletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in\\nme revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The\\ncoming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those\\nhorrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the\\nkey. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile\\non the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I\\nwas helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come\\nhe might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and\\ncreate a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the\\nhelpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me\\nto rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,\\nbut I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the\\ncases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the\\nhateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full\\nupon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to\\nparalyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,\\nmerely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my\\nhand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade\\ncaught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid\\nthing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,\\nblood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its\\nown in the nethermost hell.\\n\\n\\nI thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed\\non fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I\\nwaited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming\\ncloser, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the\\ncracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had\\nspoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which\\ncontained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count\\'s\\nroom, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.\\nWith strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the\\nkey in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must\\nhave been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of\\nthe locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and\\ndying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to\\nrun down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;\\nbut at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the\\ndoor to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from\\nthe lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was\\nhopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing\\nround me more closely.\\n\\n\\nAs I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet\\nand the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,\\nwith their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the\\nbox being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again\\nalong the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.\\n\\n\\nThe door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key\\nin the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and\\nshuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.\\n\\n\\nHark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,\\nthe crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the\\ndistance.\\n\\n\\nI am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,\\nand there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!\\n\\n\\nI shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall\\nfarther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with\\nme, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.\\n\\n\\nAnd then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away\\nfrom this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his\\nchildren still walk with earthly feet!\\n\\n\\nAt least God\\'s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the\\nprecipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep--as a man.\\nGood-bye, all! Mina!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\n_Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"_9 May._\\n\\n\\n\"My dearest Lucy,--\\n\\n\\n\"Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed\\nwith work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.\\nI am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together\\nfreely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard\\nlately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan\\'s studies, and I have\\nbeen practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall\\nbe able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I\\ncan take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for\\nhim on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He\\nand I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a\\nstenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I\\nshall keep a diary in the same way. I don\\'t mean one of those\\ntwo-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a\\nsort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not\\nsuppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not\\nintended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it\\nanything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try\\nto do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing\\ndescriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with\\na little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears\\nsaid during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little\\nplans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan\\nfrom Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I\\nam longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange\\ncountries. I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see them\\ntogether. There is the ten o\\'clock bell ringing. Good-bye.\\n\\n\\n\"Your loving\\n\\n\\n\"MINA.\\n\\n\\n\"Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for\\na long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome,\\ncurly-haired man???\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.\\n\\n\\n\"_17, Chatham Street_,\\n\\n\\n\"_Wednesday_.\\n\\n\\n\"My dearest Mina,--\\n\\n\\n\"I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I\\nwrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your\\n_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing\\nto interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal\\nto picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the\\ntall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the\\nlast Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.\\nHolmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well\\ntogether; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some\\ntime ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already\\nengaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well\\noff, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He\\nis only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under\\nhis own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to\\nsee us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men\\nI ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I\\ncan fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has\\na curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to\\nread one\\'s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter\\nmyself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do\\nyou ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not\\na bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you\\nhave never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological\\nstudy, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient\\ninterest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a\\nbore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.\\nThere, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other\\nsince we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and\\nlaughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like\\nto speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn\\'t you guess? I love him. I am blushing\\nas I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so in\\nwords. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that\\ndoes me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire\\nundressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.\\nI do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,\\nor I should tear up the letter, and I don\\'t want to stop, for I _do_ so\\nwant to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me all\\nthat you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your\\nprayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.\\n\\n\\n\"LUCY.\\n\\n\\n\"P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.\\n\\n\\n\"L.\"\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.\\n\\n\\n\"_24 May_.\\n\\n\\n\"My dearest Mina,--\\n\\n\\n\"Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so\\nnice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.\\n\\n\\n\"My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.\\nHere am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a\\nproposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.\\nJust fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn\\'t it awful! I feel sorry,\\nreally and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so\\nhappy that I don\\'t know what to do with myself. And three proposals!\\nBut, for goodness\\' sake, don\\'t tell any of the girls, or they would be\\ngetting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured\\nand slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at\\nleast. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and\\nare going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can\\ndespise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep\\nit a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You\\nwill tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell\\nArthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don\\'t you think\\nso, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to\\nbe quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always\\nquite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just\\nbefore lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum\\nman, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool\\noutwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling\\nhimself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he\\nalmost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don\\'t generally do\\nwhen they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept\\nplaying with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to\\nme, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,\\nthough he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to\\nhelp and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I\\ndid not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute\\nand would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if\\nI could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,\\nand then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one\\nelse. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my\\nconfidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman\\'s heart was\\nfree a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to\\ntell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he\\nstood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my\\nhands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever\\nwanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can\\'t\\nhelp crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being\\nproposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn\\'t at\\nall a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know\\nloves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to\\nknow that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing\\nquite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so\\nmiserable, though I am so happy.\\n\\n\\n\"_Evening._\\n\\n\\n\"Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left\\noff, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two\\ncame after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and\\nhe looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he\\nhas been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise\\nwith poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her\\near, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that\\nwe think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now\\nwhat I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I\\ndon\\'t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never\\ntold any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.\\nMorris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl\\nalone. No, he doesn\\'t, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I\\nhelping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you\\nbeforehand that Mr. Morris doesn\\'t always speak slang--that is to say,\\nhe never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well\\neducated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me\\nto hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there\\nwas no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my\\ndear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he\\nhas to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall\\never speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never\\nheard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked\\nas happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was\\nvery nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Miss Lucy, I know I ain\\'t good enough to regulate the fixin\\'s of your\\nlittle shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you\\nwill go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won\\'t\\nyou just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road\\ntogether, driving in double harness?\\'\\n\\n\\n\"Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn\\'t seem\\nhalf so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as\\nlightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I\\nwasn\\'t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in\\na light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so\\non so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He\\nreally did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn\\'t help\\nfeeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid\\nflirt--though I couldn\\'t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was\\nnumber two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he\\nbegan pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very\\nheart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall\\nnever again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,\\nbecause he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face\\nwhich checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of\\nmanly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here\\nspeaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right\\nthrough to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow\\nto another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is\\nI\\'ll never trouble you a hair\\'s breadth again, but will be, if you will\\nlet me, a very faithful friend.\\'\\n\\n\\n\"My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy\\nof them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true\\ngentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think\\nthis a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very\\nbadly. Why can\\'t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want\\nher, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say\\nit. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into\\nMr. Morris\\'s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he\\neven loves me.\\' I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a\\nlight came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I\\nthink I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--\\n\\n\\n\"\\'That\\'s my brave girl. It\\'s better worth being late for a chance of\\nwinning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don\\'t\\ncry, my dear. If it\\'s for me, I\\'m a hard nut to crack; and I take it\\nstanding up. If that other fellow doesn\\'t know his happiness, well, he\\'d\\nbetter look for it soon, or he\\'ll have to deal with me. Little girl,\\nyour honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that\\'s rarer than a\\nlover; it\\'s more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I\\'m going to have a pretty\\nlonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won\\'t you give me one kiss?\\nIt\\'ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you\\nknow, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,\\nmy dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn\\'t spoken\\nyet.\\' That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and\\nnoble, too, to a rival--wasn\\'t it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and\\nkissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down\\ninto my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Little girl, I hold your hand, and you\\'ve kissed me, and if these\\nthings don\\'t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet\\nhonesty to me, and good-bye.\\' He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,\\nwent straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a\\nquiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like\\nthat be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would\\nworship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--only\\nI don\\'t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I\\ncannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I\\ndon\\'t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.\\n\\n\\n\"Ever your loving\\n\\n\\n\"LUCY.\\n\\n\\n\"P.S.--Oh, about number Three--I needn\\'t tell you of number Three, need\\nI? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his\\ncoming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was\\nkissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don\\'t know what I have done to\\ndeserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not\\nungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a\\nlover, such a husband, and such a friend.\\n\\n\\n\"Good-bye.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n(Kept in phonograph)\\n\\n\\n_25 May._--Ebb tide in appetite to-day.

Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and\\nlovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in\\nwhich they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the\\nEsk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the\\nharbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the\\nview seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is\\nbeautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land\\non either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to\\nsee down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all\\nred-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the\\npictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby\\nAbbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of\\n\"Marmion,\" where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble\\nruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is\\na legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and\\nthe town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big\\ngraveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in\\nWhitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the\\nharbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness\\nstretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that\\npart of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been\\ndestroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches\\nout over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside\\nthem, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long\\nlooking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and\\nsit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my\\nbook on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are\\nsitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and\\ntalk.\\n\\n\\nThe harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall\\nstretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in\\nthe middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside\\nof it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,\\nand its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a\\nnarrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.\\n\\n\\nIt is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to\\nnothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between\\nbanks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this\\nside there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of\\nwhich runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of\\nit is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a\\nmournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is\\nlost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he\\nis coming this way....\\n\\n\\nHe is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all\\ngnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is\\nnearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing\\nfleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical\\nperson, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady\\nat the abbey he said very brusquely:--\\n\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t fash masel\\' about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.\\nMind, I don\\'t say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn\\'t in\\nmy time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an\\' the like,\\nbut not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and\\nLeeds that be always eatin\\' cured herrin\\'s an\\' drinkin\\' tea an\\' lookin\\'\\nout to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel\\' who\\'d be\\nbothered tellin\\' lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of\\nfool-talk.\" I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting\\nthings from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about\\nthe whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin\\nwhen the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn\\'t like\\nto be kept waitin\\' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to\\ncrammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of \\'em; an\\', miss, I lack\\nbelly-timber sairly by the clock.\"\\n\\n\\nHe hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down\\nthe steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from\\nthe town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how\\nmany--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that\\na horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally\\nhave had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went\\nout visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did\\nnot go. They will be home by this.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_1 August._--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most\\ninteresting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come\\nand join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think\\nmust have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit\\nanything, and downfaces everybody. If he can\\'t out-argue them he bullies\\nthem, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy\\nwas looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a\\nbeautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did\\nnot lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.\\nShe is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her\\non the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but\\ngave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,\\nand he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it\\nand put it down:--\\n\\n\\n\"It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that\\'s what it be, an\\'\\nnowt else. These bans an\\' wafts an\\' boh-ghosts an\\' barguests an\\' bogles\\nan\\' all anent them is only fit to set bairns an\\' dizzy women\\na-belderin\\'. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an\\' all grims an\\' signs\\nan\\' warnin\\'s, be all invented by parsons an\\' illsome beuk-bodies an\\'\\nrailway touters to skeer an\\' scunner hafflin\\'s, an\\' to get folks to do\\nsomethin\\' that they don\\'t other incline to. It makes me ireful to think\\no\\' them. Why, it\\'s them that, not content with printin\\' lies on paper\\nan\\' preachin\\' them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin\\' them on the\\ntombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them\\nsteans, holdin\\' up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,\\nis acant--simply tumblin\\' down with the weight o\\' the lies wrote on\\nthem, \\'Here lies the body\\' or \\'Sacred to the memory\\' wrote on all of\\nthem, an\\' yet in nigh half of them there bean\\'t no bodies at all; an\\'\\nthe memories of them bean\\'t cared a pinch of snuff about, much less\\nsacred. Lies all of them, nothin\\' but lies of one kind or another! My\\ngog, but it\\'ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they\\ncome tumblin\\' up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an\\' tryin\\' to\\ndrag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them\\ntrimmlin\\' and ditherin\\', with their hands that dozzened an\\' slippy from\\nlyin\\' in the sea that they can\\'t even keep their grup o\\' them.\"\\n\\n\\nI could see from the old fellow\\'s self-satisfied air and the way in\\nwhich he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was\\n\"showing off,\" so I put in a word to keep him going:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Mr. Swales, you can\\'t be serious. Surely these tombstones are not\\nall wrong?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin\\' where they make\\nout the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be\\nlike the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now\\nlook you here; you come here a stranger, an\\' you see this kirk-garth.\" I\\nnodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite\\nunderstand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.\\nHe went on: \"And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be\\nhapped here, snod an\\' snog?\" I assented again. \"Then that be just where\\nthe lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as\\nold Dun\\'s \\'bacca-box on Friday night.\" He nudged one of his companions,\\nand they all laughed. \"And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at\\nthat one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!\" I went over and\\nread:--\\n\\n\\n\"Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of\\nAndres, April, 1854, æt. 30.\" When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast\\nof Andres! an\\' you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a\\ndozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above\"--he pointed\\nnorthwards--\"or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the\\nsteans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of\\nthe lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost in\\nthe _Lively_ off Greenland in \\'20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the\\nsame seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year\\nlater; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned\\nin the Gulf of Finland in \\'50. Do ye think that all these men will have\\nto make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums\\naboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they\\'d be jommlin\\' an\\'\\njostlin\\' one another that way that it \\'ud be like a fight up on the ice\\nin the old days, when we\\'d be at one another from daylight to dark, an\\'\\ntryin\\' to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.\" This was\\nevidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his\\ncronies joined in with gusto.\\n\\n\\n\"But,\" I said, \"surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the\\nassumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to\\ntake their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think\\nthat will be really necessary?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!\"\\n\\n\\n\"To please their relatives, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\\n\"To please their relatives, you suppose!\" This he said with intense\\nscorn. \"How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote\\nover them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?\" He\\npointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on\\nwhich the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. \"Read the\\nlies on that thruff-stean,\" he said. The letters were upside down to me\\nfrom where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over\\nand read:--\\n\\n\\n\"Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a\\nglorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at\\nKettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly\\nbeloved son. \\'He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.\\'\\nReally, Mr. Swales, I don\\'t see anything very funny in that!\" She spoke\\nher comment very gravely and somewhat severely.\\n\\n\\n\"Ye don\\'t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that\\'s because ye don\\'t gawm the\\nsorrowin\\' mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was\\nacrewk\\'d--a regular lamiter he was--an\\' he hated her so that he\\ncommitted suicide in order that she mightn\\'t get an insurance she put on\\nhis life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that\\nthey had for scarin\\' the crows with. \\'Twarn\\'t for crows then, for it\\nbrought the clegs and the dowps to him. That\\'s the way he fell off the\\nrocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I\\'ve often heard him\\nsay masel\\' that he hoped he\\'d go to hell, for his mother was so pious\\nthat she\\'d be sure to go to heaven, an\\' he didn\\'t want to addle where\\nshe was. Now isn\\'t that stean at any rate\"--he hammered it with his\\nstick as he spoke--\"a pack of lies? and won\\'t it make Gabriel keckle\\nwhen Geordie comes pantin\\' up the grees with the tombstean balanced on\\nhis hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!\"\\n\\n\\nI did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she\\nsaid, rising up:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot\\nleave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a\\nsuicide.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That won\\'t harm ye, my pretty; an\\' it may make poor Geordie gladsome to\\nhave so trim a lass sittin\\' on his lap. That won\\'t hurt ye. Why, I\\'ve\\nsat here off an\\' on for nigh twenty years past, an\\' it hasn\\'t done me\\nno harm. Don\\'t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn\\' lie\\nthere either! It\\'ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the\\ntombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field.\\nThere\\'s the clock, an\\' I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!\" And off\\nhe hobbled.\\n\\n\\nLucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we\\ntook hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and\\ntheir coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I\\nhaven\\'t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_The same day._ I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no\\nletter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.\\nThe clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the\\ntown, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;\\nthey run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my\\nleft the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next\\nthe abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind\\nme, and there is a clatter of a donkey\\'s hoofs up the paved road below.\\nThe band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further\\nalong the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.\\nNeither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them\\nboth. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he\\nwere here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_5 June._--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to\\nunderstand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed;\\nselfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the\\nobject of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,\\nbut what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of\\nanimals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I\\nsometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd\\nsorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a\\nquantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he\\ndid not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in\\nsimple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: \"May I have\\nthree days? I shall clear them away.\" Of course, I said that would do. I\\nmust watch him.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_18 June._--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several\\nvery big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and\\nthe number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he\\nhas used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his\\nroom.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_1 July._--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his\\nflies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked\\nvery sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all\\nevents. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time\\nas before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a\\nhorrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,\\nhe caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger\\nand thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his\\nmouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it\\nwas very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and\\ngave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must\\nwatch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem\\nin his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always\\njotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of\\nfigures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the\\ntotals added in batches again, as though he were \"focussing\" some\\naccount, as the auditors put it.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_8 July._--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in\\nmy mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,\\nunconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your\\nconscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I\\nmight notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except\\nthat he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has\\nmanaged to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means\\nof taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that\\ndo remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by\\ntempting them with his food.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_19 July._--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of\\nsparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came\\nin he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very,\\nvery great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked\\nhim what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and\\nbearing:--\\n\\n\\n\"A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,\\nand teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!\" I was not unprepared for this\\nrequest, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and\\nvivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows\\nshould be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so\\nI said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a\\ncat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should\\nrefuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?\" I shook\\nmy head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but\\nthat I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of\\ndanger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant\\nkilling. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him\\nwith his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know\\nmore.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_10 p. m._--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner\\nbrooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and\\nimplored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.\\nI was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon\\nhe went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner\\nwhere I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_20 July._--Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his\\nrounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar,\\nwhich he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his\\nfly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I\\nlooked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they\\nwere. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.\\nThere were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of\\nblood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if\\nthere were anything odd about him during the day.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_11 a. m._--The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has\\nbeen very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. \"My belief is,\\ndoctor,\" he said, \"that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took\\nand ate them raw!\"\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_11 p. m._--I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make\\neven him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought\\nthat has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory\\nproved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to\\ninvent a new classification for him, and call him a zoöphagous\\n(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he\\ncan, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He\\ngave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then\\nwanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later\\nsteps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It\\nmight be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at\\nvivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science\\nin its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? Had\\nI even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy of\\neven one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch\\ncompared with which Burdon-Sanderson\\'s physiology or Ferrier\\'s\\nbrain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient\\ncause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good\\ncause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an\\nexceptional brain, congenitally?\\n\\n\\nHow well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I\\nwonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has\\nclosed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How\\nmany of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?\\n\\n\\nTo me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,\\nand that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great\\nRecorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to\\nprofit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be\\nangry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on\\nhopeless and work. Work! work!\\n\\n\\nIf I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there--a\\ngood, unselfish cause to make me work--that would be indeed happiness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Murray\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_26 July._--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it\\nis like whispering to one\\'s self and listening at the same time. And\\nthere is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it\\ndifferent from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I\\nhad not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but\\nyesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from\\nhim. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed\\nhad just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,\\nand says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;\\nI do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,\\nalthough she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in\\nher sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided\\nthat I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has\\ngot an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and\\nalong the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over\\nwith a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is\\nnaturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy\\'s\\nfather, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress\\nhimself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the\\nautumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is\\nto be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan\\nand I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to\\nmake both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only\\nson of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he can\\nleave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is\\ncounting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat\\non the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it\\nis the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he\\narrives.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_27 July._--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,\\nthough why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if\\nit were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I\\nam awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so\\nhot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually\\nbeing wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and\\nwakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy\\'s health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been\\nsuddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously\\nill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch\\nher looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely\\nrose-pink. She has lost that anæmic look which she had. I pray it will\\nall last.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_3 August._--Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to\\nMr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He\\nsurely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but\\nsomehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is\\nhis writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in\\nher sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her\\nwhich I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching\\nme. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room\\nsearching for the key.\\n\\n\\n_6 August._--Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting\\ndreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should\\nfeel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last\\nletter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable\\nthan ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and\\nthe fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and\\nlearn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is\\nhidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except\\nthe green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;\\ngrey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the\\ngrey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea\\nis tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,\\nmuffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey\\nmist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and\\nthere is a \"brool\" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.\\nDark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in\\nthe mist, and seem \"men like trees walking.\" The fishing-boats are\\nracing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into\\nthe harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is\\nmaking straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that\\nhe wants to talk....\\n\\n\\nI have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat\\ndown beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--\\n\\n\\n\"I want to say something to you, miss.\" I could see he was not at ease,\\nso I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak\\nfully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked\\nthings I\\'ve been sayin\\' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;\\nbut I didn\\'t mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I\\'m gone. We\\naud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don\\'t\\naltogether like to think of it, and we don\\'t want to feel scart of it;\\nan\\' that\\'s why I\\'ve took to makin\\' light of it, so that I\\'d cheer up my\\nown heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain\\'t afraid of dyin\\', not a\\nbit; only I don\\'t want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at\\nhand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to\\nexpect; and I\\'m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin\\' his\\nscythe. Ye see, I can\\'t get out o\\' the habit of caffin\\' about it all at\\nonce; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of\\nDeath will sound his trumpet for me. But don\\'t ye dooal an\\' greet, my\\ndeary!\"--for he saw that I was crying--\"if he should come this very\\nnight I\\'d not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a\\nwaitin\\' for somethin\\' else than what we\\'re doin\\'; and death be all that\\nwe can rightly depend on. But I\\'m content, for it\\'s comin\\' to me, my\\ndeary, and comin\\' quick. It may be comin\\' while we be lookin\\' and\\nwonderin\\'. Maybe it\\'s in that wind out over the sea that\\'s bringin\\' with\\nit loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!\" he\\ncried suddenly. \"There\\'s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont\\nthat sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It\\'s in the\\nair; I feel it comin\\'. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call\\ncomes!\" He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth\\nmoved as though he were praying. After a few minutes\\' silence, he got\\nup, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled\\noff. It all touched me, and upset me very much.\\n\\n\\nI was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his\\narm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time\\nkept looking at a strange ship.\\n\\n\\n\"I can\\'t make her out,\" he said; \"she\\'s a Russian, by the look of her;\\nbut she\\'s knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn\\'t know her mind\\na bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can\\'t decide whether to\\nrun up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is\\nsteered mighty strangely, for she doesn\\'t mind the hand on the wheel;\\nchanges about with every puff of wind. We\\'ll hear more of her before\\nthis time to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nCUTTING FROM \"THE DAILYGRAPH,\" 8 AUGUST\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(_Pasted in Mina Murray\\'s Journal._)\\n\\n\\nFrom a Correspondent.\\n\\n\\n_Whitby_.\\n\\n\\nOne of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been\\nexperienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had\\nbeen somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of\\nAugust. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great\\nbody of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,\\nRobin Hood\\'s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in\\nthe neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made\\ntrips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of\\n\"tripping\" both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the\\nafternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff\\nchurchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of\\nsea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of\\n\"mares\\'-tails\" high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then\\nblowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical\\nlanguage is ranked \"No. 2: light breeze.\" The coastguard on duty at once\\nmade report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has\\nkept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic\\nmanner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very\\nbeautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that\\nthere was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old\\nchurchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black\\nmass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its\\ndownward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,\\npurple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and\\nthere masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all\\nsorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The\\nexperience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the\\nsketches of the \"Prelude to the Great Storm\" will grace the R. A. and R.\\nI. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and\\nthere that his \"cobble\" or his \"mule,\" as they term the different\\nclasses of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.\\nThe wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there\\nwas a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on\\nthe approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There\\nwere but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,\\nwhich usually \"hug\" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but\\nfew fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign\\nschooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The\\nfoolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for\\ncomment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal\\nher to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she\\nwas seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating\\nswell of the sea,\\n\\n\\n    \"As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.\"\\n\\n\\nShortly before ten o\\'clock the stillness of the air grew quite\\noppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep\\ninland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the\\nband on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the\\ngreat harmony of nature\\'s silence. A little after midnight came a\\nstrange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to\\ncarry a strange, faint, hollow booming.\\n\\n\\nThen without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the\\ntime, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,\\nthe whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in\\ngrowing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes\\nthe lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.\\nWhite-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the\\nshelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept\\nthe lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier\\nof Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such\\nforce that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,\\nor clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary\\nto clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the\\nfatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to\\nthe difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came\\ndrifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,\\nso dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of\\nimagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were\\ntouching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many\\na one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist\\ncleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the\\nlightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals\\nof thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock\\nof the footsteps of the storm.\\n\\n\\nSome of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of\\nabsorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with\\neach wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to\\nsnatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with\\na rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again\\nthe white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East\\nCliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been\\ntried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in\\nthe pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.\\nOnce or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,\\nwith gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance\\nof the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the\\npiers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of\\njoy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed\\nto cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.\\n\\n\\nBefore long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner\\nwith all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed\\nearlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,\\nand there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they\\nrealized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the\\nport lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time\\nto time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,\\nit would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the\\nharbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so\\ngreat that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost\\nvisible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such\\nspeed that, in the words of one old salt, \"she must fetch up somewhere,\\nif it was only in hell.\" Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than\\nany hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things\\nlike a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,\\nfor the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the\\nbooming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder\\nthan before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour\\nmouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited\\nbreathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant\\nof the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between\\nthe piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,\\nswept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and\\ngained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a\\nshudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a\\ncorpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each\\nmotion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great\\nawe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had\\nfound the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,\\nall took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The\\nschooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on\\nthat accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many\\nstorms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East\\nCliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.\\n\\n\\nThere was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on\\nthe sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the\\n\"top-hammer\" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant\\nthe shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as\\nif shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow\\non the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard\\nhangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat\\ntombstones--\"thruff-steans\" or \"through-stones,\" as they call them in\\nthe Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff\\nhas fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed\\nintensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.\\n\\n\\nIt so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as\\nall those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were\\nout on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern\\nside of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the\\nfirst to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring\\nthe entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the\\nlight on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and\\nwhen he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at\\nonce as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general\\ncuriosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way\\nround from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your\\ncorrespondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.\\nWhen I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,\\nwhom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the\\ncourtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted\\nto climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman\\nwhilst actually lashed to the wheel.\\n\\n\\nIt was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for\\nnot often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened\\nby his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between\\nthe inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it\\nwas fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by\\nthe binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but\\nthe flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of\\nthe wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he\\nwas tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the\\nstate of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot\\nPlace--who came immediately after me, declared, after making\\nexamination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his\\npocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of\\npaper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said\\nthe man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his\\nteeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some\\ncomplications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot\\nclaim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a\\nderelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young\\nlaw student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already\\ncompletely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the\\nstatutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of\\ndelegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say\\nthat the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where\\nhe held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as\\nnoble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to\\nawait inquest.\\n\\n\\nAlready the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;\\ncrowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over\\nthe Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further\\ndetails of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into\\nharbour in the storm.\\n\\n\\n_Whitby_\\n\\n\\n_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the\\nstorm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It\\nturns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the\\n_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a\\nsmall amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.\\nThis cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of\\n7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took\\npossession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,\\nacting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and\\npaid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except\\nthe strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been\\nmost exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with\\nexisting regulations. As the matter is to be a \"nine days\\' wonder,\" they\\nare evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after\\ncomplaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which\\nlanded when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the\\nS. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the\\nanimal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;\\nit seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it\\nwas frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still\\nhiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a\\npossibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it\\nis evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred\\nmastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found\\ndead in the roadway opposite to its master\\'s yard. It had been fighting,\\nand manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,\\nand its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been\\npermitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order\\nup to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest\\nexcept as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is\\nwith regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced\\nat the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them\\nunfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for\\nconcealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a\\nrescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and\\nsupercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with\\nsome kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that\\nthis had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my\\nstatement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the\\ndictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for\\nme, time being short.\\n\\n\\n                         LOG OF THE \"DEMETER.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Varna to Whitby._\\n\\n\\n_Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep\\naccurate note henceforth till we land._\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nOn 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.\\nAt noon set sail.

He said that in his watch he had been sheltering\\nbehind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall,\\nthin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,\\nand go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously,\\nbut when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.\\nHe was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may\\nspread.

First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such\\nfoolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep\\nthem out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the\\nrest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left\\nno corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there\\nwere no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when\\nsearch over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but\\nsaid nothing.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_22 July_.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with\\nsails--no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread.\\nMate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad\\nweather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_24 July_.--There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short,\\nand entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last\\nnight another man lost--disappeared. Like the first, he came off his\\nwatch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round\\nrobin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate\\nangry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do\\nsome violence.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_28 July_.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom,\\nand the wind a tempest.

Thorough search,\\nbut no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic.

Had hoped when in\\nthe English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.\\nNot having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower,\\nas could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible\\ndoom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature\\nseems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear,\\nworking stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are\\nRussian, he Roumanian.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_2 August, midnight_.--Woke up from few minutes\\' sleep by hearing a cry,\\nseemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and\\nran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on\\nwatch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits\\nof Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as\\nhe heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and\\nonly God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God\\nseems to have deserted us.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_3 August_.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and\\nwhen I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran\\nbefore it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the\\nmate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He\\nlooked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given\\nway. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my\\near, as though fearing the very air might hear: \"_It_ is here; I know\\nit, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,\\nand ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind\\nIt, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the\\nair.\" And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into\\nspace. Then he went on: \"But It is here, and I\\'ll find It. It is in the\\nhold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I\\'ll unscrew them one by one and\\nsee. You work the helm.\" And, with a warning look and his finger on his\\nlip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could\\nnot leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest\\nand a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,\\nraving mad, and it\\'s no use my trying to stop him. He can\\'t hurt those\\nbig boxes: they are invoiced as \"clay,\" and to pull them about is as\\nharmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and\\nwrite these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.\\nThen, if I can\\'t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut\\ndown sails and lie by, and signal for help....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nIt is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate\\nwould come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the\\nhold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden,\\nstartled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he\\ncame as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and\\nhis face convulsed with fear. \"Save me! save me!\" he cried, and then\\nlooked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in\\na steady voice he said: \"You had better come too, captain, before it is\\ntoo late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me\\nfrom Him, and it is all that is left!\" Before I could say a word, or\\nmove forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately\\nthrew himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was\\nthis madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has\\nfollowed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these\\nhorrors when I get to port? _When_ I get to port! Will that ever be?\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_4 August._--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is\\nsunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go\\nbelow, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in\\nthe dimness of the night I saw It--Him! God forgive me, but the mate was\\nright to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a\\nsailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not\\nleave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie\\nmy hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with\\nthem I shall tie that which He--It!--dare not touch; and then, come good\\nwind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am\\ngrowing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the\\nface again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap\\nthis bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,\\n... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. God\\nand the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying\\nto do his duty....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nOf course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce;\\nand whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now\\nnone to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is\\nsimply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is\\narranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk\\nfor a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey\\nsteps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners\\nof more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as\\nwishing to follow him to the grave.\\n\\n\\nNo trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much\\nmourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I\\nbelieve, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so\\nwill end this one more \"mystery of the sea.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Murray\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_8 August._--Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not\\nsleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the\\nchimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be\\nlike a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up\\ntwice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and\\nmanaged to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It\\nis a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is\\nthwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,\\ndisappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her\\nlife.\\n\\n\\nEarly in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see\\nif anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about,\\nand though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,\\ngrim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that\\ntopped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth\\nof the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I\\nfelt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But,\\noh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully\\nanxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most\\ntouching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin\\nwas carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the\\nchurchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst\\nthe cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down\\nagain. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.\\nThe poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on\\nit when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.\\nShe was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that\\nher dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:\\nshe will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if\\nthere be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional\\ncause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our\\nseat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,\\nfallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of\\nfear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor\\ndear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so\\nsweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other\\npeople do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did\\nnot much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men\\nwho came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.\\nThe dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw\\nthe man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would\\nnot come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few\\nyards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then\\nharshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a\\nnoise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs\\nbristling out like a cat\\'s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally\\nthe man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then\\ntook it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on\\nthe tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the\\nstone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did\\nnot try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was\\nin such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,\\nto comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to\\ntouch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly\\nfear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world\\nwithout trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The\\nwhole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead\\nman; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the\\ntouching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all\\nafford material for her dreams.\\n\\n\\nI think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I\\nshall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood\\'s Bay and\\nback. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nMINA MURRAY\\'S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Same day, 11 o\\'clock p. m._--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I\\nhad made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely\\nwalk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some\\ndear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,\\nand frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything\\nexcept, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean\\nand give us a fresh start. We had a capital \"severe tea\" at Robin Hood\\'s\\nBay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over\\nthe seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have\\nshocked the \"New Woman\" with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless\\nthem! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,\\nand with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was\\nreally tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.\\nThe young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay\\nfor supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I\\nknow it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that\\nsome day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new\\nclass of curates, who don\\'t take supper, no matter how they may be\\npressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and\\nbreathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and\\nlooks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her\\nonly in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.\\nSome of the \"New Women\" writers will some day start an idea that men and\\nwomen should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or\\naccepting. But I suppose the New Woman won\\'t condescend in future to\\naccept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make\\nof it, too! There\\'s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,\\nbecause dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the\\ncorner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be\\nquite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_11 August, 3 a. m._--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write.\\nI am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an\\nagonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....\\nSuddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear\\nupon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,\\nso I could not see Lucy\\'s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed\\nwas empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The\\ndoor was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her\\nmother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some\\nclothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it\\nstruck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her\\ndreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.\\nDressing-gown and dress were both in their places. \"Thank God,\" I said\\nto myself, \"she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.\" I ran\\ndownstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in\\nall the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear\\nchilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It\\nwas not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people\\nof the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that\\nLucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what\\nmight happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a\\nbig, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the\\nCrescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North\\nTerrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At\\nthe edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to\\nthe East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don\\'t know which--of seeing Lucy\\nin our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,\\ndriving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of\\nlight and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see\\nnothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary\\'s Church and all\\naround it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey\\ncoming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as\\na sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually\\nvisible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for\\nthere, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a\\nhalf-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too\\nquick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost\\nimmediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind\\nthe seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,\\nwhether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another\\nglance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the\\nfish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East\\nCliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced\\nthat it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy\\'s condition. The\\ntime and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath\\ncame laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have\\ngone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with\\nlead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost\\nto the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now\\nclose enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There\\nwas undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the\\nhalf-reclining white figure. I called in fright, \"Lucy! Lucy!\" and\\nsomething raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face\\nand red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the\\nentrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and\\nthe seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in\\nview again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly\\nthat I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back\\nof the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living\\nthing about.\\n\\n\\nWhen I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips\\nwere parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in\\nlong, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every\\nbreath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the\\ncollar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so\\nthere came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I\\nflung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,\\nfor I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,\\nunclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to\\nhave my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her\\nthroat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety\\nand pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing\\nbecame quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I\\nhad her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began\\nvery gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she\\nbecame more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing\\noccasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other\\nreasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,\\ntill finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised\\nto see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.\\nLucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must\\nhave been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking\\nunclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She\\ntrembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with\\nme home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we\\npassed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She\\nstopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.\\nHowever, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there\\nwas a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with\\nmud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no\\none, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.\\n\\n\\nFortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw\\na man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of\\nus; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as\\nthere are here, steep little closes, or \"wynds,\" as they call them in\\nScotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I\\nshould faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her\\nhealth, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation\\nin case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our\\nfeet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into\\nbed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a\\nword to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I\\nhesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her\\nmother\\'s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,\\nand thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,\\ninfallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do\\nso. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to\\nmy wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping\\nsoundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Same day, noon._--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed\\nnot to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not\\nseem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she\\nlooks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to\\nnotice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might\\nhave been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have\\npinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are\\ntwo little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress\\nwas a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she\\nlaughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it\\ncannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Same day, night._--We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the\\nsun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave\\nWoods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the\\ncliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for\\nI could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had\\nJonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening\\nwe strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr\\nand Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she\\nhas been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door\\nand secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any\\ntrouble to-night.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_12 August._--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I\\nwas wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to\\nbe a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed\\nunder a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds\\nchirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,\\nwas even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of\\nmanner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me\\nand told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about\\nJonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded\\nsomewhat, for, though sympathy can\\'t alter facts, it can help to make\\nthem more bearable.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_13 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as\\nbefore. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,\\nstill asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling\\naside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft\\neffect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,\\nsilent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight\\nflitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or\\ntwice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,\\nand flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back\\nfrom the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.\\nShe did not stir again all night.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems\\nto have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to\\nget her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or\\ndinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for\\ndinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and\\nstopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low\\ndown in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was\\nthrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe\\neverything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and\\nsuddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--\\n\\n\\n\"His red eyes again! They are just the same.\" It was such an odd\\nexpression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I\\nslewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare\\nat her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on\\nher face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but\\nfollowed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,\\nwhereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,\\nfor it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like\\nburning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red\\nsunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary\\'s Church behind our\\nseat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the\\nrefraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I\\ncalled Lucy\\'s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself\\nwith a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she\\nwas thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I\\nsaid nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went\\nearly to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;\\nI walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet\\nsadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was then\\nbright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the\\nCrescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance\\nup at our window, and saw Lucy\\'s head leaning out. I thought that\\nperhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and\\nwaved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,\\nthe moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell\\non the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against\\nthe side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and\\nby her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a\\ngood-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,\\nbut as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast\\nasleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,\\nas though to protect it from cold.\\n\\n\\nI did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the\\ndoor is locked and the window securely fastened.\\n\\n\\nShe looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and\\nthere is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I\\nfear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it\\nis.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_15 August._--Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and\\nslept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast.\\nArthur\\'s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy\\nis full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on\\nin the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her\\nvery own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to\\nprotect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got\\nher death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;\\nher doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for\\nher heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be\\nalmost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of\\nthe dreadful night of Lucy\\'s sleep-walking.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_17 August._--No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to\\nwrite. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.\\nNo news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her\\nmother\\'s hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy\\'s\\nfading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys\\nthe fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and\\nshe gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping\\nas if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at\\nnight, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open\\nwindow. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I\\ntried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to\\nrestore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,\\npainful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the\\nwindow she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may\\nnot be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat\\njust now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.\\nThey are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the\\nedges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with\\nred centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the\\ndoctor seeing about them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Samuel F.

Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all\\nnight, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already\\nto her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she\\nwere in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in\\ngay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence\\nseems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I\\nneeded any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this\\nvery seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with\\nthe heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"My poor little feet didn\\'t make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.\\nSwales would have told me that it was because I didn\\'t want to wake up\\nGeordie.\" As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she\\nhad dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered\\nlook came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her\\nhabit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don\\'t wonder that he does. Then she\\nwent on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to\\nherself:--\\n\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be\\nhere in this spot--I don\\'t know why, for I was afraid of something--I\\ndon\\'t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing\\nthrough the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and\\nI leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the\\nwhole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as\\nI went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and\\ndark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very\\nsweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking\\ninto deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have\\nheard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away\\nfrom me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.\\nI seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,\\nand then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an\\nearthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do\\nit before I felt you.\"\\n\\n\\nThen she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I\\nlistened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it\\nbetter not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other\\nsubjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the\\nfresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more\\nrosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very\\nhappy evening together.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_19 August._--Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of\\nJonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I\\nam not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent\\nme on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the\\nmorning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary,\\nand to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if\\nwe were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister\\'s\\nletter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is of\\nJonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is _in_ my heart. My journey\\nis all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one change of\\ndress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for\\nit, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to say\\nto Jonathan, my husband.

About\\neight o\\'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when\\nsetting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest\\nin him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the\\nattendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was\\nquite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he\\nwould say was:--\\n\\n\\n     \"I don\\'t want to talk to you: you don\\'t count now; the Master is at\\n     hand.\"\\n\\n\\nThe attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has\\nseized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with\\nhomicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The\\ncombination is a dreadful one. At nine o\\'clock I visited him myself. His\\nattitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime\\nself-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him\\nas nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that\\nhe himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man\\nare too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves\\naway! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created\\nfrom human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,\\nif men only knew!\\n\\n\\nFor half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and\\ngreater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict\\nobservation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his\\neyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it\\nthe shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to\\nknow so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his\\nbed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I\\nwould find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to\\nlead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite\\nhis attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--\\n\\n\\n\"Bother them all! I don\\'t care a pin about them.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What?\" I said. \"You don\\'t mean to tell me you don\\'t care about\\nspiders?\" (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling\\nup with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:--\\n\\n\\n\"The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;\\nbut when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes\\nthat are filled.\"\\n\\n\\nHe would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed\\nall the time I remained with him.\\n\\n\\nI am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and\\nhow different things might have been. If I don\\'t sleep at once, chloral,\\nthe modern Morpheus--C_{2}HCl_{3}O. H_{2}O! I must be careful not to let\\nit grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of\\nLucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be,\\nto-night shall be sleepless....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had\\nlain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the\\nnight-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield\\nhad escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is\\ntoo dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might\\nwork out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.\\nHe said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his\\nbed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His\\nattention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He\\nran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once\\nsent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.\\nThe attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should\\ngo than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out\\nof the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn\\'t get through\\nthe window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,\\nand, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The\\nattendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a\\nstraight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt\\nof trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our\\ngrounds from those of the deserted house.\\n\\n\\nI ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men\\nimmediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend\\nmight be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,\\ndropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield\\'s figure just\\ndisappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the\\nfar side of the house I found him pressed close against the old\\nironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some\\none, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest\\nI might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of\\nbees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping\\nis upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not\\ntake note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to\\nhim--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him\\nin. I heard him say:--\\n\\n\\n\"I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will\\nreward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar\\noff. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass\\nme by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?\"\\n\\n\\nHe _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes\\neven when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a\\nstartling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.\\nHe is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I\\nnever saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I\\nshall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and\\nhis danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he\\nmight have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any\\nrate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn\\'t get free from the strait-waistcoat\\nthat keeps him restrained, and he\\'s chained to the wall in the padded\\nroom. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are\\nmore deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.\\n\\n\\nJust now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--\\n\\n\\n\"I shall be patient, Master. It is coming--coming--coming!\"\\n\\n\\nSo I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this\\ndiary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._\\n\\n\\n\"_Buda-Pesth, 24 August._\\n\\n\\n\"My dearest Lucy,--\\n\\n\\n\"I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we\\nparted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull\\nall right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I\\nfeel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I\\nknew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some\\nnursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,\\noh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out\\nof his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his\\nface has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not\\nremember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At\\nleast, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some\\nterrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try\\nto recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,\\ntells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I\\nwanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,\\nand say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the\\nsecrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear\\nthem, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the\\nnext day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,\\nand after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved\\nabout, added: \\'I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about\\nanything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,\\nhave no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes\\nto you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can\\ntreat of.\\' I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my\\npoor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of\\n_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I\\nfelt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a\\ncause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his\\nface while he sleeps. He is waking!...\\n\\n\\n\"When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something\\nfrom the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.\\nI saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to\\nlet me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his\\ntrouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent\\nme over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.\\nThen he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the\\nnote-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Wilhelmina\\'--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has\\nnever called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--\\'you know,\\ndear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no\\nsecret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to\\nthink of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it\\nwas all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain\\nfever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to\\nknow it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.\\' For, my\\ndear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are\\ncomplete. \\'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is\\nthe book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me\\nknow; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to\\nthe bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.\\' He fell\\nback exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I\\nhave asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this\\nafternoon, and am waiting her reply....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n\"She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission\\nchurch has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon\\nafter as Jonathan awakes....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n\"Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very\\nhappy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he\\nsat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his \\'I will\\' firmly\\nand strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those\\nwords seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I\\nshall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities\\nI have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the\\nchaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it\\nis the first time I have written the words \\'my husband\\'--left me alone\\nwith my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it\\nup in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon\\nwhich was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,\\nand for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it\\nto my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would\\nbe an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each\\nother; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake\\nor for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,\\nLucy, it was the first time he took _his wife\\'s_ hand, and said that it\\nwas the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go\\nthrough all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to\\nhave said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I\\nshall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the\\nyear.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the\\nhappiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him\\nexcept myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love\\nand duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,\\nand drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn\\npledge between us....\\n\\n\\n\"Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because\\nit is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to\\nme. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from\\nthe schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,\\nand with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that\\nin your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,\\nplease Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of\\nsunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must\\nnot wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be\\n_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at\\nonce, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan\\nis waking--I must attend to my husband!\\n\\n\\n\"Your ever-loving\\n\\n\\n\"MINA HARKER.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker._\\n\\n\\n\"_Whitby, 30 August._\\n\\n\\n\"My dearest Mina,--\\n\\n\\n\"Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own\\nhome with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough to\\nstay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has\\nquite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of\\nlife, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given\\nup walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a\\nweek, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am getting\\nfat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have such\\nwalks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing\\ntogether; and I love him more than ever. He _tells_ me that he loves me\\nmore, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn\\'t love me\\nmore than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me.\\nSo no more just at present from your loving\\n\\n\\n\"LUCY.\\n\\n\\n\"P. S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear. \"P. P.\\nS.--We are to be married on 28 September.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_20 August._--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has\\nnow so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.\\nFor the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one\\nnight, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to\\nhimself: \"Now I can wait; now I can wait.\" The attendant came to tell\\nme, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the\\nstrait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone\\nfrom his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might\\nalmost say, \"cringing\"--softness. I was satisfied with his present\\ncondition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,\\nbut finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange\\nthing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,\\ncoming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking\\nfurtively at them:--\\n\\n\\n\"They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!\"\\n\\n\\nIt was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated\\neven in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I\\ndo not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in\\ncommon with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has\\nhe to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful\\nto him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the\\noffer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will\\nonly say: \"I don\\'t take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,\\nand I can wait; I can wait.\"\\n\\n\\nAfter a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet\\nuntil just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at\\nlength violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted\\nhim so that he swooned into a sort of coma.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n... Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quiet\\nfrom moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It\\nwould almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.\\nHappy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He\\nescaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We\\nshall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they\\nare required....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_23 August._--\"The unexpected always happens.\" How well Disraeli knew\\nlife. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our\\nsubtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one\\nthing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in\\nfuture be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given\\norders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,\\nwhen once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul\\'s\\nbody will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!\\nThe unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the\\nattendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him\\nand flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.\\nAgain he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him\\nin the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me\\nhe became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he\\nwould have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing\\nhappened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew\\ncalm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught\\nthe patient\\'s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked\\ninto the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and\\nghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one\\nseemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had\\nsome intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and\\npresently said:--\\n\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t tie me; I shall go quietly!\" Without trouble we came back\\nto the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall\\nnot forget this night....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Lucy Westenra\\'s Diary_\\n\\n\\n_Hillingham, 24 August._--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things\\ndown. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will\\nbe. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I\\nseemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the\\nchange of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me,\\nfor I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so\\nweak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved\\nwhen he saw me, and I hadn\\'t the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder\\nif I could sleep in mother\\'s room to-night.

She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to\\nworry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the\\nclock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling\\nasleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I\\ndid not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have\\nfallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This\\nmorning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains\\nme. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don\\'t seem ever to\\nget air enough.

At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with\\nher appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw\\nher last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full\\nopportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship\\nmakes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can\\nbridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to\\ndraw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have\\ndone and propose doing.\\n\\n\\n\"I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,\\nand in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew\\nto mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no\\ndoubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.\\nWe lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we\\ngot, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness\\namongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with\\nme. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,\\nfor the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,\\nhowever, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair\\nwith a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her\\nhigh spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to\\nmake a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--\\n\\n\\n\"\\'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.\\' I reminded her\\nthat a doctor\\'s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously\\nanxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that\\nmatter in a word. \\'Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for\\nmyself, but all for him!\\' So I am quite free.\\n\\n\\n\"I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see\\nthe usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the\\nquality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord\\ngave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a\\nslight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured\\na few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative\\nanalysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in\\nitself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite\\nsatisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a\\ncause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something\\nmental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at\\ntimes, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but\\nregarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she\\nused to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,\\nand that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where\\nMiss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not\\nreturned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I\\nhave written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of\\nAmsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the\\nworld. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things\\nwere to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your\\nrelations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to\\nyour wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for\\nher. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal\\nreason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his\\nwishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows\\nwhat he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher\\nand a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;\\nand he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron\\nnerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,\\nself-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the\\nkindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the\\nnoble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and\\npractice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I\\ntell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in\\nhim. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra\\nto-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not\\nalarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.\\n\\n\\n\"Yours always,\\n\\n\\n\"JOHN SEWARD.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Abraham Van Helsing, M.

Arthur Holmwood._\\n\\n\\n\"_3 September._\\n\\n\\n\"My dear Art,--\\n\\n\\n\"Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and\\nfound that, by Lucy\\'s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that\\nwe were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of\\nthe patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of\\ncourse I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,\\nbut says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you\\ntrust to me in the matter, he said: \\'You must tell him all you think.\\nTell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not\\njesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.\\' I asked\\nwhat he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had\\ncome back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his\\nreturn to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not\\nbe angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his\\nbrains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the\\ntime comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of\\nour visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for\\n_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the\\nsmuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a\\nstudent here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make\\nit. In any case I am to have a letter.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first\\nsaw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the\\nghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was\\nvery sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him\\nfeel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard\\nstruggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick\\nlook under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of\\nall things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite\\ngeniality that I could see poor Lucy\\'s pretense of animation merge into\\nreality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation\\ngently round to his visit, and suavely said:--\\n\\n\\n\"\\'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so\\nmuch beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not\\nsee. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a\\nghastly pale. To them I say: \"Pouf!\"\\' And he snapped his fingers at me\\nand went on: \\'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can\\nhe\\'--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with\\nwhich once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a\\nparticular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--\\'know anything\\nof a young ladies? He has his madams to play with, and to bring them\\nback to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,\\noh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the\\nyoung ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell\\nthemselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many\\nsorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to\\nsmoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all\\nto ourselves.\\' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the\\nprofessor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but\\nsaid: \\'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional\\ncause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has\\nbeen, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I have\\nasked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,\\nthat so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.\\nAnd yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go\\nback home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if\\nthere be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all well\\nis a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me\\ntoo. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.\\'\\n\\n\\n\"As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.\\nAnd so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust\\nyour poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my\\ndear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who\\nare both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and\\nyou are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to\\ncome at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from\\nme.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_4 September._--Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.\\nHe had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just\\nbefore the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew\\nthe symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a\\nrun, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so\\nviolent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five\\nminutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank\\ninto a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The\\nattendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really\\nappalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the\\nother patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite\\nunderstand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was\\nsome distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and\\nas yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,\\nwoe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show\\nsomething directly. I cannot quite understand it.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o\\'clock I looked in on\\nhim, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He\\nwas catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture\\nby making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of\\npadding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad\\nconduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to\\nhis own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to\\nhumour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the\\nsugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a\\nharvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a\\nbox, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find\\na spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any\\nclue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not\\nrise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of\\nfar-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do\\nit for myself!\" Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:\\n\"Doctor, won\\'t you be very good to me and let me have a little more\\nsugar? I think it would be good for me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And the flies?\" I said.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like\\nit.\" And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do\\nnot argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man\\nas, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,\\nwhom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our\\nown gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As\\nhis room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in\\nthe morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky\\nbeauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows\\nand all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul\\nwater, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone\\nbuilding, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart\\nto endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from\\nhis window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less\\nfrenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an\\ninert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual\\nrecuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up\\nquite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to\\nhold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight\\nover to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his\\nfly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut\\nthe window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised\\nme, so I asked him: \"Are you not going to keep flies any more?\"\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" said he; \"I am sick of all that rubbish!\" He certainly is a\\nwonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his\\nmind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue\\nafter all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon\\nand at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at\\nperiods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?\\nWe shall see.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._\\n\\n\\n\"_4 September._--Patient still better to-day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._\\n\\n\\n\"_5 September._--Patient greatly improved.

Come at once; do not\\nlose an hour. I hold over telegram to Holmwood till have seen you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._\\n\\n\\n\"_6 September._\\n\\n\\n\"My dear Art,--\\n\\n\\n\"My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.\\nThere is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.\\nWestenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me\\nprofessionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told\\nher that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to\\nstay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with\\nmyself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a\\nshock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy\\'s weak\\ncondition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with\\ndifficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall\\ncome through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you\\ndo not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for\\nnews. In haste\\n\\n\\nYours ever,\\n\\n\\n\"JOHN SEWARD.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at\\nLiverpool Street was:--\\n\\n\\n\"Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?\"\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" I said. \"I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I\\nwrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss\\nWestenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Right, my friend,\" he said, \"quite right! Better he not know as yet;\\nperhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he\\nshall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal\\nwith the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch\\nas you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God\\'s madmen,\\ntoo--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why\\nyou do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge\\nin its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it\\nand breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.\" He\\ntouched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself\\nthe same way. \"I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall\\nunfold to you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Why not now?\" I asked. \"It may do some good; we may arrive at some\\ndecision.\" He stopped and looked at me, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has\\nripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine\\nhas not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the\\near and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,\\nand say to you: \\'Look! he\\'s good corn; he will make good crop when the\\ntime comes.\\'\" I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply\\nhe reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as\\nhe used long ago to do at lectures, and said: \"The good husbandman tell\\nyou so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the\\ngood husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for\\nthe children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of\\nthe work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,\\nand Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,\\nthere\\'s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.\" He broke\\noff, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very\\ngravely:--\\n\\n\\n\"You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more\\nfull than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and\\nI trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that\\nknowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.\\nEven if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this\\ncase of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such\\ninterest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the\\nbeam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too\\nsmall. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.\\nHereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We\\nlearn from failure, not from success!\"\\n\\n\\nWhen I described Lucy\\'s symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely\\nmore marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a\\nbag in which were many instruments and drugs, \"the ghastly paraphernalia\\nof our beneficial trade,\" as he once called, in one of his lectures, the\\nequipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,\\nMrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I\\nexpected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained\\nthat even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case\\nwhere any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some\\ncause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her\\ndaughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is\\nsomething like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an\\nenvelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that\\nwhich it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered\\nselfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice\\nof egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have\\nknowledge of.\\n\\n\\nI used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down\\na rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness\\nmore than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that\\nI saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were\\nshown up to Lucy\\'s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I\\nwas horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the\\nred seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of\\nher face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or\\nhear. Van Helsing\\'s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged\\ntill they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not\\nseem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then\\nVan Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The\\ninstant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to\\nthe next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and\\nclosed the door. \"My God!\" he said; \"this is dreadful. There is no time\\nto be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart\\'s\\naction as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is\\nit you or me?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.\"\\n\\n\\nI went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at\\nthe hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the\\ndoor, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in\\nan eager whisper:--\\n\\n\\n\"Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and\\nhave been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for\\nmyself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,\\nsir, for coming.\" When first the Professor\\'s eye had lit upon him he had\\nbeen angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in\\nhis stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which\\nseemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to\\nhim gravely as he held out his hand:--\\n\\n\\n\"Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is\\nbad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.\" For he\\nsuddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. \"You are to\\nhelp her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your\\nbest help.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What can I do?\" asked Arthur hoarsely. \"Tell me, and I shall do it. My\\nlife is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for\\nher.\" The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old\\nknowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--\\n\\n\\n\"My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!\"\\n\\n\\n\"What shall I do?\" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril\\nquivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. \"Come!\"\\nhe said. \"You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than\\nme, better than my friend John.\" Arthur looked bewildered, and the\\nProfessor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--\\n\\n\\n\"Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have\\nor die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform\\nwhat we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to\\nthe empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is\\nthe more young and strong than me\"--here Arthur took my hand and wrung\\nit hard in silence--\"but, now you are here, you are more good than us,\\nold or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not\\nso calm and our blood not so bright than yours!\" Arthur turned to him\\nand said:--\\n\\n\\n\"If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would\\nunderstand----\"\\n\\n\\nHe stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.\\n\\n\\n\"Good boy!\" said Van Helsing. \"In the not-so-far-off you will be happy\\nthat you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You\\nshall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you\\nmust leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with\\nher! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!\"\\n\\n\\nWe all went up to Lucy\\'s room. Arthur by direction remained outside.\\nLucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not\\nasleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke\\nto us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid\\nthem on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and\\ncoming over to the bed, said cheerily:--\\n\\n\\n\"Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good\\nchild. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.\" She had made\\nthe effort with success.\\n\\n\\nIt astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked\\nthe extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to\\nflicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest\\nits potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was\\nsatisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his\\ncoat. Then he added: \"You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring\\nover the table. Friend John, help to me!\" So neither of us looked whilst\\nhe bent over her.\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing turning to me, said:\\n\\n\\n\"He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not\\ndefibrinate it.\"\\n\\n\\nThen with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the\\noperation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come\\nback to poor Lucy\\'s cheeks, and through Arthur\\'s growing pallor the joy\\nof his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow\\nanxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he\\nwas. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy\\'s system must\\nhave undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.\\nBut the Professor\\'s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with\\nhis eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own\\nheart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: \"Do not stir an instant.\\nIt is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.\" When all was over I\\ncould see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his\\narm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the\\nman seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--\\n\\n\\n\"The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have\\npresently.\" And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the\\npillow to the patient\\'s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band\\nwhich she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old\\ndiamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,\\nand showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I\\ncould hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing\\'s\\nways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to\\nme, saying: \"Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port\\nwine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep\\nmuch and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to\\nhis love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,\\nthat you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways\\nthe operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you\\ncan go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell\\nher all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you\\nhave done. Good-bye.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,\\nbut her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her\\nbreast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.\\nThe velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a\\nwhisper:--\\n\\n\\n\"What do you make of that mark on her throat?\"\\n\\n\\n\"What do you make of it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I have not examined it yet,\" I answered, and then and there proceeded\\nto loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two\\npunctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of\\ndisease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some\\ntrituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it\\nwas, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned\\nthe idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed\\nwould have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must\\nhave lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.\\n\\n\\n\"Well?\" said Van Helsing.\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I can make nothing of it.\" The Professor stood up. \"I\\nmust go back to Amsterdam to-night,\" he said. \"There are books and\\nthings there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you\\nmust not let your sight pass from her.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Shall I have a nurse?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n\"We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that\\nshe is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all\\nthe night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as\\npossible. And then we may begin.\"\\n\\n\\n\"May begin?\" I said. \"What on earth do you mean?\"\\n\\n\\n\"We shall see!\" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment\\nlater and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held\\nup:--\\n\\n\\n\"Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you\\nshall not sleep easy hereafter!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary--continued._\\n\\n\\n_8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself\\noff towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being\\nfrom what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,\\nand she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the\\nabsolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra\\nthat Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she\\nalmost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter\\'s renewed\\nstrength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made\\npreparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the\\nnight I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by\\nthe bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me\\ngratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed\\nsinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together\\nand shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort\\nand with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she\\ndid not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--\\n\\n\\n\"You do not want to go to sleep?\"\\n\\n\\n\"No; I am afraid.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!\"\\n\\n\\n\"A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know; oh, I don\\'t know. And that is what is so terrible. All\\nthis weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and\\nI can promise that nothing will happen.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, I can trust you!\" I seized the opportunity, and said: \"I promise\\nyou that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\"You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will\\nsleep!\" And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank\\nback, asleep.\\n\\n\\nAll night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on\\nin a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were\\nslightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a\\npendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad\\ndreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.\\n\\n\\nIn the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took\\nmyself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short\\nwire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result\\nof the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all\\nday to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my\\nzoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the\\npast day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst\\nI was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as\\nit might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the\\nnight mail and would join me early in the morning.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to\\nHillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my\\nbrain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral\\nexhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands\\nwith me she looked sharply in my face and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well\\nagain; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who\\nwill sit up with you.\" I would not argue the point, but went and had my\\nsupper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I\\nmade an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than\\nexcellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next\\nher own, where a cozy fire was burning. \"Now,\" she said, \"you must stay\\nhere. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the\\nsofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to\\nbed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I\\nshall call out, and you can come to me at once.\" I could not but\\nacquiesce, for I was \"dog-tired,\" and could not have sat up had I tried.\\nSo, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,\\nI lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Lucy Westenra\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,\\nthat to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after\\na long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,\\nvery close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose\\nit is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner\\neyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love\\nrein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know\\nwhere my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears\\nmust tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of\\nlast night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.\\nAnd to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and\\nwithin call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!\\nGood-night, Arthur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor\\'s hand on my head, and\\nstarted awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn\\nin an asylum, at any rate.\\n\\n\\n\"And how is our patient?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,\" I answered.\\n\\n\\n\"Come, let us see,\" he said. And together we went into the room.\\n\\n\\nThe blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van\\nHelsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.\\n\\n\\nAs I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I\\nheard the Professor\\'s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a\\ndeadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and\\nhis exclamation of horror, \"Gott in Himmel!\" needed no enforcement from\\nhis agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his\\niron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.\\n\\n\\nThere on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly\\nwhite and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums\\nseemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a\\ncorpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp\\nin anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit\\nstood to him, and he put it down again softly. \"Quick!\" he said. \"Bring\\nthe brandy.\" I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.\\nHe wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and\\nwrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising\\nsuspense said:--\\n\\n\\n\"It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is\\nundone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have\\nto call on you yourself this time, friend John.\" As he spoke, he was\\ndipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I\\nhad taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no\\npossibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,\\nwithout a moment\\'s delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did\\nnot seem a short time either, for the draining away of one\\'s blood, no\\nmatter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing\\nheld up a warning finger. \"Do not stir,\" he said, \"but I fear that with\\ngrowing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much\\ndanger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection\\nof morphia.\" He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his\\nintent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge\\nsubtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride\\nthat I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid\\ncheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to\\nfeel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.\\n\\n\\nThe Professor watched me critically. \"That will do,\" he said. \"Already?\"\\nI remonstrated. \"You took a great deal more from Art.\" To which he\\nsmiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--\\n\\n\\n\"He is her lover, her _fiancé_. You have work, much work, to do for her\\nand for others; and the present will suffice.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied\\ndigital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his\\nleisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by\\nhe bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for\\nmyself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half\\nwhispered:--\\n\\n\\n\"Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up\\nunexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and\\nenjealous him, too. There must be none. So!\"\\n\\n\\nWhen I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--\\n\\n\\n\"You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and\\nrest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.\"\\n\\n\\nI followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I\\nhad done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I\\nfelt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at\\nwhat had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over\\nand over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how\\nshe could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to\\nshow for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,\\nsleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little\\npunctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their\\nedges--tiny though they were.\\n\\n\\nLucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and\\nstrong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing\\nhad seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict\\ninjunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his\\nvoice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.\\n\\n\\nLucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything\\nhad happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother\\ncame up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but\\nsaid to me gratefully:--\\n\\n\\n\"We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really\\nmust now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale\\nyourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you\\ndo!\" As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,\\nfor her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted\\ndrain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned\\nimploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my\\nlips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:\\n\"Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I\\nstay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and\\nI must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave\\nreasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think\\neven the most not-probable. Good-night.\"\\n\\n\\nIn the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of\\nthem might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and\\nwhen I said it was Dr. Van Helsing\\'s wish that either he or I should sit\\nup, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the \"foreign\\ngentleman.\" I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because\\nI am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy\\'s account, that\\ntheir devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen\\nsimilar instances of woman\\'s kindness. I got back here in time for a\\nlate dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting\\nfor sleep. It is coming.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van\\nHelsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had\\narrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it\\nwith much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of\\nwhite flowers.\\n\\n\\n\"These are for you, Miss Lucy,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\"For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.\" Here\\nLucy made a wry face. \"Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or\\nin nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall\\npoint out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing\\nso much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,\\nthat bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but\\nyou do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and\\nhang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the\\nlotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters\\nof Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought\\nfor in the Floridas, and find him all too late.\"\\n\\n\\nWhilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling\\nthem. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and\\nhalf-disgust:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,\\nthese flowers are only common garlic.\"\\n\\n\\nTo my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his\\niron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--\\n\\n\\n\"No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;\\nand I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of\\nothers if not for your own.\" Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might\\nwell be, he went on more gently: \"Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear\\nme. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so\\ncommon flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the\\nwreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so\\ninquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;\\nand obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait\\nfor you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall\\nhelp me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,\\nwhere my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.\\nI had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.\"\\n\\n\\nWe went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor\\'s\\nactions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia\\nthat I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them\\nsecurely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over\\nthe sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get\\nin would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed\\nall over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round\\nthe fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and\\npresently I said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but\\nthis certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he\\nwould say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps I am!\" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which\\nLucy was to wear round her neck.\\n\\n\\nWe then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she\\nwas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her\\nneck. The last words he said to her were:--\\n\\n\\n\"Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do\\nnot to-night open the window or the door.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I promise,\" said Lucy, \"and thank you both a thousand times for all\\nyour kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such\\nfriends?\"\\n\\n\\nAs we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n\\n\"To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,\\nmuch reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,\\nand a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early\\nyou call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much\\nmore strong for my \\'spell\\' which I have work. Ho! ho!\"\\n\\n\\nHe seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights\\nbefore and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must\\nhave been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but\\nI felt it all the more, like unshed tears.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\n_Lucy Westenra\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.\\nVan Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He\\npositively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been\\nright, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread\\nbeing alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not\\nmind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I\\nhave had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,\\nor the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has\\nfor me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no\\ndreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings\\nnothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,\\nand lying like Ophelia in the play, with \"virgin crants and maiden\\nstrewments.\" I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!\\nThere is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,\\neverybody.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,\\nup to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The\\nProfessor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.\\n\\n\\nLet all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at\\neight o\\'clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the\\nfresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature\\'s\\nannual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,\\nbut had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met\\nMrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early\\nriser. She greeted us warmly and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still\\nasleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I\\nshould disturb her.\" The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He\\nrubbed his hands together, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,\" to\\nwhich she answered:--\\n\\n\\n\"You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy\\'s state this\\nmorning is due in part to me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"How you do mean, ma\\'am?\" asked the Professor.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into\\nher room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did\\nnot wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those\\nhorrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually\\na bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be\\ntoo much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away\\nand opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be\\npleased with her, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\\nShe moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As\\nshe had spoken, I watched the Professor\\'s face, and saw it turn ashen\\ngrey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady\\nwas present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;\\nhe actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into\\nher room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and\\nforcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.\\n\\n\\nThen, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He\\nraised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat\\nhis palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,\\nand putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs\\nthat seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised\\nhis arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. \"God! God!\\nGod!\" he said. \"What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that\\nwe are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the\\npagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor\\nmother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such\\nthing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we\\nmust not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are\\nbeset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!\" Suddenly he\\njumped to his feet. \"Come,\" he said, \"come, we must see and act. Devils\\nor no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him\\nall the same.\" He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we\\nwent up to Lucy\\'s room.\\n\\n\\nOnce again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.\\nThis time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same\\nawful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and\\ninfinite pity.\\n\\n\\n\"As I expected,\" he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which\\nmeant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then\\nbegan to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another\\noperation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the\\nnecessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a\\nwarning hand. \"No!\" he said. \"To-day you must operate. I shall provide.\\nYou are weakened already.\" As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled\\nup his shirt-sleeve.\\n\\n\\nAgain the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to\\nthe ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I\\nwatched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.\\n\\n\\nPresently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must\\nnot remove anything from Lucy\\'s room without consulting him; that the\\nflowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour\\nwas a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case\\nhimself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would\\nsend me word when to come.\\n\\n\\nAfter another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and\\nseemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.\\n\\n\\nWhat does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life\\namongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Lucy Westenra\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong\\nagain that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some\\nlong nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and\\nfeel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim\\nhalf-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness\\nin which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress\\nmore poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to\\nlife as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,\\nhowever, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems\\nto have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my\\nwits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed\\nso close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and\\ncommanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now\\nwithout any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown\\nquite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from\\nHaarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a\\nday in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left\\nalone. Thank God for mother\\'s sake, and dear Arthur\\'s, and for all our\\nfriends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for\\nlast night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found\\nhim asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,\\nalthough the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against\\nthe window-panes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_\"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" 18 September._\\n\\n\\n                           THE ESCAPED WOLF.\\n\\n\\n         PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.\\n\\n\\n         _Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens._\\n\\n\\nAfter many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using\\nthe words \"Pall Mall Gazette\" as a sort of talisman, I managed to find\\nthe keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolf\\ndepartment is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in\\nthe enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to\\nhis tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,\\nelderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their\\nhospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty\\ncomfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called \"business\"\\nuntil the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the\\ntable was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You\\'ll excoose me\\nrefoosin\\' to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the\\nwolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore\\nI begins to arsk them questions.\"\\n\\n\\n\"How do you mean, ask them questions?\" I queried, wishful to get him\\ninto a talkative humour.\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Ittin\\' of them over the \\'ead with a pole is one way; scratchin\\' of\\ntheir hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf\\nto their gals. I don\\'t so much mind the fust--the \\'ittin\\' with a pole\\nafore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they\\'ve \\'ad their\\nsherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the\\near-scratchin\\'. Mind you,\" he added philosophically, \"there\\'s a deal of\\nthe same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here\\'s you a-comin\\' and\\narskin\\' of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that\\nonly for your bloomin\\' \\'arf-quid I\\'d \\'a\\' seen you blowed fust \\'fore I\\'d\\nanswer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I\\'d like you to\\narsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence\\ndid I tell yer to go to \\'ell?\"\\n\\n\\n\"You did.\"\\n\\n\\n\"An\\' when you said you\\'d report me for usin\\' of obscene language that\\nwas \\'ittin\\' me over the \\'ead; but the \\'arf-quid made that all right. I\\nweren\\'t a-goin\\' to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my \\'owl\\nas the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor\\' love yer \\'art, now\\nthat the old \\'ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an\\' rinsed\\nme out with her bloomin\\' old teapot, and I\\'ve lit hup, you may scratch\\nmy ears for all you\\'re worth, and won\\'t git even a growl out of me.\\nDrive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin\\' at, that \\'ere\\nescaped wolf.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it\\nhappened; and when I know the facts I\\'ll get you to say what you\\nconsider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will\\nend.\"\\n\\n\\n\"All right, guv\\'nor. This \\'ere is about the \\'ole story. That \\'ere wolf\\nwhat we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from\\nNorway to Jamrach\\'s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a\\nnice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I\\'m more\\nsurprised at \\'im for wantin\\' to get out nor any other animile in the\\nplace. But, there, you can\\'t trust wolves no more nor women.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you mind him, sir!\" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. \"\\'E\\'s\\ngot mindin\\' the animiles so long that blest if he ain\\'t like a old wolf\\n\\'isself! But there ain\\'t no \\'arm in \\'im.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin\\' yesterday when I first\\nhear my disturbance. I was makin\\' up a litter in the monkey-house for a\\nyoung puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin\\' and \\'owlin\\' I kem\\naway straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin\\' like a mad thing at the\\nbars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn\\'t much people about that\\nday, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a \\'ook\\nnose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin\\' through it. He\\nhad a \\'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,\\nfor it seemed as if it was \\'im as they was hirritated at. He \\'ad white\\nkid gloves on \\'is \\'ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:\\n\\'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.\\'\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Maybe it\\'s you,\\' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give\\n\\'isself. He didn\\'t git angry, as I \\'oped he would, but he smiled a kind\\nof insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. \\'Oh no, they\\nwouldn\\'t like me,\\' \\'e says.\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Ow yes, they would,\\' says I, a-imitatin\\' of him. \\'They always likes a\\nbone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you \\'as a\\nbagful.\\'\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin\\' they\\nlay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears\\nsame as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn\\'t put\\nin his hand and stroke the old wolf\\'s ears too!\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Tyke care,\\' says I. \\'Bersicker is quick.\\'\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Never mind,\\' he says. \\'I\\'m used to \\'em!\\'\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Are you in the business yourself?\\' I says, tyking off my \\'at, for a\\nman what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.\\n\\n\\n\"\\'No\\' says he, \\'not exactly in the business, but I \\'ave made pets of\\nseveral.\\' And with that he lifts his \\'at as perlite as a lord, and walks\\naway. Old Bersicker kep\\' a-lookin\\' arter \\'im till \\'e was out of sight,\\nand then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn\\'t come hout the \\'ole\\nhevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves\\nhere all began a-\\'owling. There warn\\'t nothing for them to \\'owl at.\\nThere warn\\'t no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin\\' a\\ndog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice\\nI went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the \\'owling\\nstopped. Just before twelve o\\'clock I just took a look round afore\\nturnin\\' in, an\\', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker\\'s\\ncage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And\\nthat\\'s all I know for certing.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Did any one else see anything?\"\\n\\n\\n\"One of our gard\\'ners was a-comin\\' \\'ome about that time from a \\'armony,\\nwhen he sees a big grey dog comin\\' out through the garding \\'edges. At\\nleast, so he says, but I don\\'t give much for it myself, for if he did \\'e\\nnever said a word about it to his missis when \\'e got \\'ome, and it was\\nonly after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all\\nnight-a-huntin\\' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein\\'\\nanything. My own belief was that the \\'armony \\'ad got into his \\'ead.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the\\nwolf?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, \"I think I can;\\nbut I don\\'t know as \\'ow you\\'d be satisfied with the theory.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from\\nexperience, can\\'t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that \\'ere\\nwolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I\\ncould see that it had done service before, and that the whole\\nexplanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn\\'t cope in badinage\\nwith the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,\\nso I said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Now, Mr. Bilder, we\\'ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,\\nand this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you\\'ve told me\\nwhat you think will happen.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Right y\\'are, sir,\" he said briskly. \"Ye\\'ll excoose me, I know, for\\na-chaffin\\' of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much\\nas telling me to go on.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I never!\" said the old lady.\\n\\n\\n\"My opinion is this: that \\'ere wolf is a-\\'idin\\' of, somewheres. The\\ngard\\'ner wot didn\\'t remember said he was a-gallopin\\' northward faster\\nthan a horse could go; but I don\\'t believe him, for, yer see, sir,\\nwolves don\\'t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein\\' built that\\nway. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets\\nin packs and does be chivyin\\' somethin\\' that\\'s more afeared than they is\\nthey can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,\\nLor\\' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so\\nclever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in\\n\\'im. This one ain\\'t been used to fightin\\' or even to providin\\' for\\nhisself, and more like he\\'s somewhere round the Park a-\\'idin\\' an\\'\\na-shiverin\\' of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin\\' where he is to get\\nhis breakfast from; or maybe he\\'s got down some area and is in a\\ncoal-cellar. My eye, won\\'t some cook get a rum start when she sees his\\ngreen eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can\\'t get food he\\'s\\nbound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher\\'s\\nshop in time. If he doesn\\'t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin\\' orf with\\na soldier, leavin\\' of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then I\\nshouldn\\'t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That\\'s\\nall.\"\\n\\n\\nI was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up\\nagainst the window, and Mr. Bilder\\'s face doubled its natural length\\nwith surprise.\\n\\n\\n\"God bless me!\" he said. \"If there ain\\'t old Bersicker come back by\\n\\'isself!\"\\n\\n\\nHe went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it\\nseemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so\\nwell as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a\\npersonal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.\\n\\n\\nAfter all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor\\nhis wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal\\nitself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all\\npicture-wolves--Red Riding Hood\\'s quondam friend, whilst moving her\\nconfidence in masquerade.\\n\\n\\nThe whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The\\nwicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the\\nchildren in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of\\npenitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine\\nprodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender\\nsolicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--\\n\\n\\n\"There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;\\ndidn\\'t I say it all along? Here\\'s his head all cut and full of broken\\nglass. \\'E\\'s been a-gettin\\' over some bloomin\\' wall or other. It\\'s a\\nshyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.\\nThis \\'ere\\'s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.\"\\n\\n\\nHe took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that\\nsatisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the\\nfatted calf, and went off to report.\\n\\n\\nI came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given\\nto-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my\\nbooks, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,\\nhad fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in\\nrushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was\\nthunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord\\ninto the Superintendent\\'s study is almost unknown. Without an instant\\'s\\npause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,\\nas I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was\\ntoo quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my\\nbalance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.\\nBefore he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was\\nsprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a\\nlittle pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not\\nintent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,\\nkeeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the\\nattendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment\\npositively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking\\nup, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was\\neasily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite\\nplacidly, simply repeating over and over again: \"The blood is the life!\\nThe blood is the life!\"\\n\\n\\nI cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of\\nlate for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy\\'s\\nillness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and\\nweary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned\\nme, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax._\\n\\n\\n(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by\\ntwenty-two hours.)\\n\\n\\n\"_17 September._--Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If not\\nwatching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as\\nplaced; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as\\npossible after arrival.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_18 September._--Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van\\nHelsing\\'s telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know\\nby bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is\\npossible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surely\\nthere is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident\\nshould thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with\\nme, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy\\'s phonograph.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra._\\n\\n\\n_17 September. Night._--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no\\none may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact\\nrecord of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and\\nhave barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the\\ndoing.\\n\\n\\nI went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.\\nVan Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.\\n\\n\\nI was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that\\nsleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I\\nknow so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in\\nthe next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have\\ncalled him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me\\nthe old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep\\nwould try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be\\nalone, I opened my door and called out: \"Is there anybody there?\" There\\nwas no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.\\nThen outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog\\'s, but\\nmore fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could\\nsee nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its\\nwings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined\\nnot to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;\\nseeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She\\nsaid to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--\\n\\n\\n\"I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all\\nright.\"\\n\\n\\nI feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in\\nand sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did\\nnot take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while\\nand then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in\\nhers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was\\nstartled and a little frightened, and cried out: \"What is that?\" I tried\\nto pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could\\nhear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was\\nthe low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a\\ncrash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.\\nThe window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the\\naperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey\\nwolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting\\nposture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst\\nother things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing\\ninsisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a\\nsecond or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange\\nand horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck\\nwith lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a\\nmoment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my\\neyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole\\nmyriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken\\nwindow, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that\\ntravellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to\\nstir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother\\'s poor body,\\nwhich seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to\\nbeat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.\\n\\n\\nThe time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered\\nconsciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the\\ndogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,\\nseemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and\\nstupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the\\nnightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort\\nme. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear\\ntheir bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they\\ncame in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay\\nover me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the\\nbroken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my\\ndear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I\\nhad got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them\\nto go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew\\nopen for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went\\nin a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear\\nmother\\'s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing\\nhad told me, but I didn\\'t like to remove them, and, besides, I would\\nhave some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that\\nthe maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went\\nto the dining-room to look for them.\\n\\n\\nMy heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless\\non the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table\\nhalf full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,\\nand examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the\\nsideboard, I found that the bottle which mother\\'s doctor uses for\\nher--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back\\nin the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for\\nthe sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I\\ndare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the\\nbroken window.\\n\\n\\nThe air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from\\nthe window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God\\nshield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,\\nwhere they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother\\ngone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not\\nsurvive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.\\nKeeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently\\nand rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her\\nmother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,\\nfinding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed\\nthe laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an\\nhour--for it was now ten o\\'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but\\nmore impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only\\nthe servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this\\ndesolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing\\ntight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too\\nlate? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of\\ndanger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;\\nand I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry\\nanywhere.\\n\\n\\nI could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and\\nlocked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the\\nrapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse\\'s feet. They stopped at the\\ngate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.\\nWhen he saw me, he gasped out:--\\n\\n\\n\"Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you\\nnot get my telegram?\"\\n\\n\\nI answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his\\ntelegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,\\nand that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and\\nraised his hat as he said solemnly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Then I fear we are too late. God\\'s will be done!\" With his usual\\nrecuperative energy, he went on: \"Come. If there be no way open to get\\nin, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.\"\\n\\n\\nWe went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen\\nwindow. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and\\nhanding it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I\\nattacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then\\nwith a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and\\nopened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There\\nwas no one in the kitchen or in the servants\\' rooms, which were close at\\nhand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,\\ndimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four\\nservant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,\\nfor their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the\\nroom left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at\\neach other, and as we moved away he said: \"We can attend to them later.\"\\nThen we ascended to Lucy\\'s room. For an instant or two we paused at the\\ndoor to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white\\nfaces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the\\nroom.\\n\\n\\nHow shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her\\nmother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white\\nsheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the\\nbroken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror\\nfixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more\\ndrawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her\\nmother\\'s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds\\nwhich we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.\\nWithout a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching\\npoor Lucy\\'s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who\\nlistens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!\"\\n\\n\\nI flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste\\nit, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found\\non the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I\\nfancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,\\nbut returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another\\noccasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her\\nhands. He said to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.\\nFlick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them\\nget heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as\\nthat beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything\\nmore.\"\\n\\n\\nI went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the\\nwomen. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently\\naffected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her\\nsleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to\\nthem they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with\\nthem, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life\\nwas bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice\\nMiss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad\\nas they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and\\nboiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We\\ngot a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst\\nwe were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One\\nof the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then\\nshe returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come\\nwith a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he\\nmust wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,\\nand, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.\\n\\n\\nI never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly\\nearnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,\\nand in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not\\nunderstand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--\\n\\n\\n\"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade\\naway into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.\" He went\\non with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.\\n\\n\\nPresently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to\\nbe of some effect. Lucy\\'s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the\\nstethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing\\'s\\nface almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in\\na hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"The first gain is ours! Check to the King!\"\\n\\n\\nWe took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid\\nher in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed\\nthat Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was\\nstill unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had\\never seen her.\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her\\nand not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me\\nout of the room.\\n\\n\\n\"We must consult as to what is to be done,\" he said as we descended the\\nstairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he\\nclosing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but\\nthe blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of\\ndeath which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly\\nobserves. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light\\nenough for our purposes. Van Helsing\\'s sternness was somewhat relieved\\nby a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about\\nsomething, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have\\nanother transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl\\'s life\\nwon\\'t be worth an hour\\'s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am\\nexhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have\\ncourage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his\\nveins for her?\"\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter with me, anyhow?\"\\n\\n\\nThe voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought\\nrelief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van\\nHelsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a\\nglad look came into his eyes as I cried out: \"Quincey Morris!\" and\\nrushed towards him with outstretched hands.\\n\\n\\n\"What brought you here?\" I cried as our hands met.\\n\\n\\n\"I guess Art is the cause.\"\\n\\n\\nHe handed me a telegram:--\\n\\n\\n\"Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.\\nCannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.\\nDo not delay.--HOLMWOOD.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell\\nme what to do.\"\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in\\nthe eyes as he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"A brave man\\'s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in\\ntrouble. You\\'re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against\\nus for all he\\'s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.\"\\n\\n\\nOnce again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart\\nto go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it\\ntold on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her\\nveins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other\\noccasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see\\nand hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van\\nHelsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with\\ngood effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched\\nwhilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids\\nto pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down\\nafter having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good\\nbreakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where\\nLucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or\\ntwo of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was\\nthinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look\\nof grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.\\nHe handed me the paper saying only: \"It dropped from Lucy\\'s breast when\\nwe carried her to the bath.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause\\nasked him: \"In God\\'s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,\\nmad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?\" I was so bewildered that I\\ndid not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the\\npaper, saying:--\\n\\n\\n\"Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know\\nand understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what\\nis it that you came to me to say?\" This brought me back to fact, and I\\nwas all myself again.\\n\\n\\n\"I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act\\nproperly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have\\nto be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we\\nhad it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you\\nknow, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra\\nhad disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us\\nfill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the\\nregistrar and go on to the undertaker.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be\\nsad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that\\nlove her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old\\nman. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the\\nmore for it! Now go.\"\\n\\n\\nIn the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him\\nthat Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now\\ngoing on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him\\nwhere I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--\\n\\n\\n\"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to\\nourselves?\" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about\\nthe registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in\\nthe evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.\\n\\n\\nWhen I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him\\nas soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still\\nsleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her\\nside. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he\\nexpected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.\\nSo I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where\\nthe blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or\\nrather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said\\nto me:--\\n\\n\\n\"Jack Seward, I don\\'t want to shove myself in anywhere where I\\'ve no\\nright to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl\\nand wanted to marry her; but, although that\\'s all past and gone, I can\\'t\\nhelp feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that\\'s wrong\\nwith her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see\\nthat--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have\\n_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.\\nNow I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man\\nmust not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is\\nno common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that\\nso?\"\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s so,\" I said, and he went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did\\nto-day. Is not that so?\"\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s so.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his\\nown place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick\\nsince I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass\\nall in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at\\nher in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there\\nwasn\\'t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a\\nbullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without\\nbetraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?\" As he spoke\\nthe poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense\\nregarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible\\nmystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very\\nheart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a\\nroyal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before\\nanswering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the\\nProfessor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed\\nso much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered\\nin the same phrase: \"That\\'s so.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And how long has this been going on?\"\\n\\n\\n\"About ten days.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature\\nthat we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood\\nof four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn\\'t hold it.\" Then,\\ncoming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: \"What took it\\nout?\"\\n\\n\\nI shook my head. \"That,\" I said, \"is the crux. Van Helsing is simply\\nfrantic about it, and I am at my wits\\' end. I can\\'t even hazard a guess.\\nThere has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out\\nall our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall\\nnot occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill.\" Quincey held\\nout his hand. \"Count me in,\" he said. \"You and the Dutchman will tell me\\nwhat to do, and I\\'ll do it.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy\\'s first movement was to feel\\nin her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing\\nhad given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had\\ncome from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van\\nHelsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,\\nand seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her\\npoor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that\\nmeant--that she had realised to the full her mother\\'s death; so we tried\\nwhat we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but\\nshe was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for\\na long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with\\nher all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell\\ninto a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she\\ntook the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped\\nover and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on\\nwith the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her\\nhands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering\\nthe fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as\\nif in thought, but he said nothing.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid\\nto sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and\\nI took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment\\nunattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew\\nthat all night long he patrolled round and round the house.\\n\\n\\nWhen the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy\\'s\\nstrength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little\\nnourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she\\nslept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between\\nsleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more\\nhaggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale\\ngums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and\\nsharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently\\nchanged the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying\\none. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.\\nQuincey went off to meet him at the station.\\n\\n\\nWhen he arrived it was nearly six o\\'clock, and the sun was setting full\\nand warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more\\ncolour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking\\nwith emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,\\nthe fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had\\ngrown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible\\nwere shortened. Arthur\\'s presence, however, seemed to act as a\\nstimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she\\nhad done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as\\ncheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.\\n\\n\\nIt was now nearly one o\\'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with\\nher. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering\\nthis on Lucy\\'s phonograph. Until six o\\'clock they are to try to rest. I\\nfear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too\\ngreat; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._\\n\\n\\n(Unopened by her.)\\n\\n\\n\"_17 September._\\n\\n\\n\"My dearest Lucy,--\\n\\n\\n\"It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You\\nwill pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my\\nbudget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived\\nat Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had\\nan attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there\\nwere rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After\\ndinner Mr. Hawkins said:--\\n\\n\\n\"\\'My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every\\nblessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with\\nlove and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here\\nwith me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in\\nmy will I have left you everything.\\' I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and\\nthe old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.\\n\\n\\n\"So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my\\nbedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral\\nclose, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow\\nstone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and\\ncawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of\\nrooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and\\nhousekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that\\nJonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the\\nclients.\\n\\n\\n\"How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a\\nday or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my\\nshoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to\\nput some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the\\nlong illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden\\nway and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual\\nplacidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the\\ndays go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now\\nI have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,\\nand where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,\\nand is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,\\ndear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests\\nyou which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his\\n\\'respectful duty,\\' but I do not think that is good enough from the\\njunior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you\\nlove me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses\\nof the verb, I send you simply his \\'love\\' instead. Good-bye, my dearest\\nLucy, and all blessings on you.\\n\\n\\n\"Yours,\\n\\n\\n\"MINA HARKER.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Report from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I.,\\netc., etc., to John Seward, M. D._\\n\\n\\n\"_20 September._\\n\\n\\n\"My dear Sir,--\\n\\n\\n\"In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of\\neverything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there\\nis more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a\\ndreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended\\nwith any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier\\'s cart with two men\\nmade a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to\\nwhich, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at\\nour gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was\\nmyself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and\\nsaw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of\\nRenfield\\'s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called\\nhim all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a\\ndecent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to \"shut up for a\\nfoul-mouthed beggar,\" whereon our man accused him of robbing him and\\nwanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to\\nswing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,\\nso he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his\\nmind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: \\'Lor\\' bless\\nyer, sir, I wouldn\\'t mind what was said to me in a bloomin\\' madhouse. I\\npity ye and the guv\\'nor for havin\\' to live in the house with a wild\\nbeast like that.\\' Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him\\nwhere the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats\\nand curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could\\nmake out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a\\nwell-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had\\never occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most\\ngenial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he\\nblandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe\\nthat he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to\\nsay, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an\\nhour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the\\nwindow of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the\\nattendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent\\non some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which\\nhad passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden\\nboxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the\\nface, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the\\npatient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to\\nknock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the\\nmoment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other\\nfellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his\\nheavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but\\nseized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and\\nfro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others\\nwere both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we\\nbegan to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat\\non him, he began to shout: \\'I\\'ll frustrate them! They shan\\'t rob me!\\nthey shan\\'t murder me by inches! I\\'ll fight for my Lord and Master!\\' and\\nall sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable\\ndifficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded\\nroom. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set\\nit all right; and he is going on well.\\n\\n\\n\"The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for\\ndamages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their\\nthreats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for\\nthe defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it\\nhad not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and\\nraising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of\\nhim. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary\\nstate of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of\\ntheir occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their\\nlabours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their\\ndrift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and\\nwith each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore\\nthat they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of\\nmeeting so \\'bloomin\\' good a bloke\\' as your correspondent. I took their\\nnames and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as\\nfollows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding\\'s Rents, King George\\'s Road, Great\\nWalworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley\\'s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal\\nGreen. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and\\nShipment Company, Orange Master\\'s Yard, Soho.\\n\\n\\n\"I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall\\nwire you at once if there is anything of importance.\\n\\n\\n\"Believe me, dear Sir,\\n\\n\\n\"Yours faithfully,\\n\\n\\n\"PATRICK HENNESSEY.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra_.\\n\\n\\n(Unopened by her.)\\n\\n\\n\"_18 September._\\n\\n\\n\"My dearest Lucy,--\\n\\n\\n\"Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.\\nSome may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him\\nthat it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either\\nfather or mother, so that the dear old man\\'s death is a real blow to me.\\nJonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,\\ndeep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,\\nand now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a\\nfortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the\\ndream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the\\namount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He\\nbegins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_\\nhelps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave\\nshock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard\\nthat a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which\\nenabled him by our dear, good friend\\'s aid to rise from clerk to master\\nin a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its\\nstrength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in\\nthe midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,\\nfor the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan\\ntries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming\\nup to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.\\nHawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his\\nfather. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief\\nmourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few\\nminutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,\\n\\n\\n\"Your loving\\n\\n\\n\"MINA HARKER.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry\\nto-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world\\nand all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard\\nthis moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has\\nbeen flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy\\'s mother\\nand Arthur\\'s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.\\n\\n\\nI duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to\\ngo to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him\\nthat we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not\\nall break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed\\nto go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. \"Come, my child,\" he said;\\n\"come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much\\nmental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You\\nmust not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.\\nCome to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two\\nsofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will\\nbe comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we\\nsleep.\" Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy\\'s\\nface, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay\\nquite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it\\nshould be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,\\nas in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the\\nwindow-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy\\'s neck, over the silk\\nhandkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of\\nthe same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and\\nher face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her\\nteeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they\\nhad been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the\\ncanine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,\\nand presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort\\nof dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,\\nand peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,\\nand I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled\\nround--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now\\nand again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,\\nI found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic\\nflowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat\\nwatching her.\\n\\n\\nPresently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.\\nShe took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with\\nher now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto\\nso marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she\\nbecame conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was\\ncertainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the\\nstertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she\\nwaked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any\\nmistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many\\nspells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.\\n\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen\\ninto a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy\\'s face\\nI could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a\\nsharp whisper: \"Draw up the blind; I want light!\" Then he bent down,\\nand, with his face almost touching Lucy\\'s, examined her carefully. He\\nremoved the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As\\nhe did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, \"Mein\\nGott!\" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,\\nand as I noticed some queer chill came over me.\\n\\n\\nThe wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.\\n\\n\\nFor fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face\\nat its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--\\n\\n\\n\"She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark\\nme, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and\\nlet him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.\"\\n\\n\\nI went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but\\nwhen he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters\\nhe thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy\\nwas still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van\\nHelsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his\\nhands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,\\nperhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders\\nshook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. \"Come,\" I\\nsaid, \"my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best\\nand easiest for her.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen we came into Lucy\\'s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with\\nhis usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making\\neverything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy\\'s\\nhair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we\\ncame into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered\\nsoftly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!\" He was stooping to\\nkiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. \"No,\" he whispered, \"not\\nyet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.\"\\n\\n\\nSo Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,\\nwith all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then\\ngradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her\\nbreast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child\\'s.\\n\\n\\nAnd then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in\\nthe night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale\\ngums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a\\nsort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which\\nwere now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,\\nsuch as I had never heard from her lips:--\\n\\n\\n\"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!\" Arthur bent\\neagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,\\nhad been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by\\nthe neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which\\nI never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost\\nacross the room.\\n\\n\\n\"Not for your life!\" he said; \"not for your living soul and hers!\" And\\nhe stood between them like a lion at bay.\\n\\n\\nArthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do\\nor say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised\\nthe place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.\\n\\n\\nI kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as\\nof rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed\\ntogether. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.\\n\\n\\nVery shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and\\nputting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing\\'s great brown\\none; drawing it to her, she kissed it. \"My true friend,\" she said, in a\\nfaint voice, but with untellable pathos, \"My true friend, and his! Oh,\\nguard him, and give me peace!\"\\n\\n\\n\"I swear it!\" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his\\nhand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said\\nto him: \"Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the\\nforehead, and only once.\"\\n\\n\\nTheir eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.\\n\\n\\nLucy\\'s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took\\nArthur\\'s arm, and drew him away.\\n\\n\\nAnd then Lucy\\'s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it\\nceased.\\n\\n\\n\"It is all over,\" said Van Helsing. \"She is dead!\"\\n\\n\\nI took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he\\nsat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that\\nnearly broke me down to see.\\n\\n\\nI went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and\\nhis face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.\\nDeath had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had\\nrecovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their\\ndeadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working\\nof the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as\\nmight be.\\n\\n\\n    \"We thought her dying whilst she slept,\\n        And sleeping when she died.\"\\n\\n\\nI stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!\"\\n\\n\\nHe turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--\\n\\n\\n\"Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!\"\\n\\n\\nWhen I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--\\n\\n\\n\"We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--_continued_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and\\nher mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly\\nformalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were\\nafflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.\\nEven the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to\\nme, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out\\nfrom the death-chamber:--\\n\\n\\n\"She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It\\'s quite a privilege to\\nattend on her. It\\'s not too much to say that she will do credit to our\\nestablishment!\"\\n\\n\\nI noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from\\nthe disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives\\nat hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his\\nfather\\'s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been\\nbidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon\\nourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy\\'s\\npapers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a\\nforeigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and\\nso might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--\\n\\n\\n\"I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But\\nthis is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the\\ncoroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such\\nas this.\"\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been\\nin Lucy\\'s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.\\n\\n\\n\"When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.\\nWestenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch\\nhere in the room and in Miss Lucy\\'s old room all night, and I myself\\nsearch for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into\\nthe hands of strangers.\"\\n\\n\\nI went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found\\nthe name and address of Mrs. Westenra\\'s solicitor and had written to\\nhim. All the poor lady\\'s papers were in order; explicit directions\\nregarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the\\nletter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,\\nsaying:--\\n\\n\\n\"Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Have you got what you looked for?\" I asked, to which he replied:--\\n\\n\\n\"I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I\\nhave, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a\\ndiary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say\\nnothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with\\nhis sanction, I shall use some.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you\\nand I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but\\nfor the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!\"\\n\\n\\nBefore turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had\\ncertainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small\\n_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,\\nand death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the\\nwinding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and\\nturned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall\\nwax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy\\'s\\nloveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,\\ninstead of leaving traces of \"decay\\'s effacing fingers,\" had but\\nrestored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes\\nthat I was looking at a corpse.\\n\\n\\nThe Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and\\nthere was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: \"Remain till I\\nreturn,\" and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic\\nfrom the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and\\nplaced the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he\\ntook from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and\\nplaced it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we\\ncame away.\\n\\n\\nI was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the\\ndoor, he entered, and at once began to speak:--\\n\\n\\n\"To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem\\nknives.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Must we make an autopsy?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you\\nnow, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out\\nher heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with\\nno tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make\\nthe rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that\\nyou loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall\\noperate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for\\nArthur I must not; he will be free after his father\\'s funeral to-morrow,\\nand he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined\\nready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall\\nunscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace\\nall, so that none know, save we alone.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body\\nwithout need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing\\nto gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human\\nknowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous.\"\\n\\n\\nFor answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite\\ntenderness:--\\n\\n\\n\"Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more\\nbecause it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden\\nthat you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you\\nshall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant\\nthings. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet\\ndid you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but\\nman; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you\\nsend for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay\\nhorrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was\\ndying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw\\nhow she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so\\nweak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not\\nhear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many\\nyears trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so\\nstrange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend\\nJohn. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is\\nnot perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no\\ntrust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,\\noh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!\" He paused a\\nmoment and went on solemnly: \"Friend John, there are strange and\\nterrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to\\na good end. Will you not have faith in me?\"\\n\\n\\nI took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,\\nand watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without\\nmoving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had\\nher back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy\\nlay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful\\nto those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl\\nputting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch\\nalone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay\\nmight not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nI must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van\\nHelsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and\\nsaid:--\\n\\n\\n\"You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Why not?\" I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly\\nimpressed me.\\n\\n\\n\"Because,\" he said sternly, \"it is too late--or too early. See!\" Here he\\nheld up the little golden crucifix. \"This was stolen in the night.\"\\n\\n\\n\"How, stolen,\" I asked in wonder, \"since you have it now?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the\\nwoman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely\\ncome, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus\\nunknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.\"\\n\\n\\nHe went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a\\nnew puzzle to grapple with.\\n\\n\\nThe forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.\\nMarquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial\\nand very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all\\ncares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for\\nsome time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs\\nin absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain\\nentailed property of Lucy\\'s father\\'s which now, in default of direct\\nissue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,\\nreal and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had\\ntold us so much he went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and\\npointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either\\npenniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial\\nalliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into\\ncollision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out\\nher wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were\\nright in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should\\nhave proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.\\nFrankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of\\ndisposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her\\nwishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come\\ninto possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her\\nmother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no\\nwill--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been\\ntreated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,\\nthough so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the\\ninheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just\\nrights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure\\nyou, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.\"\\n\\n\\nHe was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which\\nhe was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an\\nobject-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.\\n\\n\\nHe did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and\\nsee Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to\\nus, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile\\ncriticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o\\'clock, so\\na little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in\\nvery truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,\\ntrue to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and\\nthere was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at\\nonce. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,\\nexplaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be\\nless harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_\\nquite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and\\nexerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them\\nthe night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings\\nas we could avoid were saved.\\n\\n\\nPoor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart\\nmanhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his\\nmuch-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly\\nattached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a\\nbitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he\\nwas sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some\\nconstraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to\\nbring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I\\nfelt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and\\nled me in, saying huskily:--\\n\\n\\n\"You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was\\nno friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don\\'t know how to\\nthank you for all you have done for her. I can\\'t think yet....\"\\n\\n\\nHere he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and\\nlaid his head on my breast, crying:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me\\nall at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.\"\\n\\n\\nI comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much\\nexpression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the\\nshoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man\\'s\\nheart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said\\nsoftly to him:--\\n\\n\\n\"Come and look at her.\"\\n\\n\\nTogether we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.\\nGod! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her\\nloveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he\\nfell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At\\nlast, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--\\n\\n\\n\"Jack, is she really dead?\"\\n\\n\\nI assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt\\nthat such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than\\nI could help--that it often happened that after death faces became\\nsoftened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was\\nespecially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged\\nsuffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after\\nkneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and\\nlong, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the\\ncoffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his\\nand kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,\\nfondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.\\n\\n\\nI left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said\\ngood-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker\\'s men\\nto proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he\\ncame out of the room again I told him of Arthur\\'s question, and he\\nreplied:--\\n\\n\\n\"I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!\"\\n\\n\\nWe all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make\\nthe best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but\\nwhen we had lit our cigars he said--\\n\\n\\n\"Lord----\"; but Arthur interrupted him:--\\n\\n\\n\"No, no, not that, for God\\'s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:\\nI did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so\\nrecent.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Professor answered very sweetly:--\\n\\n\\n\"I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you\\n\\'Mr.,\\' and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as\\nArthur.\"\\n\\n\\nArthur held out his hand, and took the old man\\'s warmly.\\n\\n\\n\"Call me what you will,\" he said. \"I hope I may always have the title of\\na friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for\\nyour goodness to my poor dear.\" He paused a moment, and went on: \"I know\\nthat she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was\\nrude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember\"--the\\nProfessor nodded--\"you must forgive me.\"\\n\\n\\nHe answered with a grave kindness:--\\n\\n\\n\"I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such\\nviolence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you\\ncannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be\\nmore times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may\\nnot--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust\\nshall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as\\nthough the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from\\nfirst to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her\\ndear sake to whom I swore to protect.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And, indeed, indeed, sir,\" said Arthur warmly, \"I shall in all ways\\ntrust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are\\nJack\\'s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to\\nspeak, and finally said:--\\n\\n\\n\"May I ask you something now?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\n\\n\"You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?\"\\n\\n\\n\"No, poor dear; I never thought of it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I\\nwant you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy\\'s papers and\\nletters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,\\nbe sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them\\nbefore we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch\\nthem--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep\\nthem, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them\\nsafe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back\\nto you. It\\'s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for\\nLucy\\'s sake?\"\\n\\n\\nArthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--\\n\\n\\n\"Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I\\nam doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you\\nwith questions till the time comes.\"\\n\\n\\nThe old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--\\n\\n\\n\"And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be\\nall pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most of\\nall, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we\\nreach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our\\nduty, and all will be well!\"\\n\\n\\nI slept on a sofa in Arthur\\'s room that night. Van Helsing did not go to\\nbed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was\\nnever out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with\\nthe wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,\\na heavy, overpowering smell into the night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_22 September._--In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.\\n\\n\\nIt seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much\\nbetween then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and\\nno news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a\\npartner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and\\nJonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me\\nabout it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see what\\nunexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up\\nagain with an exercise anyhow....\\n\\n\\nThe service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves\\nand the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his\\nLondon agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the\\nPresident of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in\\nhand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....\\n\\n\\nWe came back to town quietly, taking a \\'bus to Hyde Park Corner.\\nJonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so\\nwe sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was\\nsad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think\\nof the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.\\nJonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days\\nbefore I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can\\'t go on\\nfor some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the\\npedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he\\nwas my husband, and we didn\\'t know anybody who saw us--and we didn\\'t\\ncare if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful\\ngirl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano\\'s,\\nwhen I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said\\nunder his breath: \"My God!\" I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I\\nfear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him\\nquickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.\\n\\n\\nHe was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and\\nhalf in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and\\nblack moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty\\ngirl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,\\nand so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was\\nhard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all\\nthe whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal\\'s.\\nJonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I\\nfeared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked\\nJonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that\\nI knew as much about it as he did: \"Do you see who it is?\"\\n\\n\\n\"No, dear,\" I said; \"I don\\'t know him; who is it?\" His answer seemed to\\nshock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was\\nto me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--\\n\\n\\n\"It is the man himself!\"\\n\\n\\nThe poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly\\nterrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to\\nsupport him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of\\nthe shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove\\noff. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage\\nmoved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a\\nhansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--\\n\\n\\n\"I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be\\nso! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!\" He was\\ndistressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the\\nsubject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him\\naway quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little\\nfurther, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was\\na hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.\\nAfter a few minutes\\' staring at nothing, Jonathan\\'s eyes closed, and he\\nwent quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it\\nwas the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty\\nminutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--\\n\\n\\n\"Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.\\nCome, and we\\'ll have a cup of tea somewhere.\" He had evidently forgotten\\nall about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that\\nthis episode had reminded him of. I don\\'t like this lapsing into\\nforgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must\\nnot ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow\\nlearn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I\\nmust open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,\\nI know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--A sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dear\\nsoul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight\\nrelapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he\\nmay be:--\\n\\n\\n\"You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and\\nthat Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.\"\\n\\n\\nOh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor\\nLucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have\\nlost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our\\ntroubles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has\\ntaken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe\\nin my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy\\'s death as any\\nof us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America\\ncan go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world\\nindeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his\\njourney. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns\\nto-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can\\nonly be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says\\nhe has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old\\nfellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his\\niron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting\\nsome terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were\\nstanding beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in\\nthe operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy\\'s veins; I\\ncould see Van Helsing\\'s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was\\nsaying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married\\nand that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of\\nthe other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went\\naway together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The\\nmoment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of\\nhysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted\\nthat it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very\\nterrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down\\nthe blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,\\ntill he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman\\ndoes. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the\\ncircumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in\\nmanifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew\\ngrave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.\\nHis reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and\\nforceful and mysterious. He said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, you don\\'t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,\\nthough I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But\\nno more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come\\njust the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your\\ndoor and say, \\'May I come in?\\' is not the true laughter. No! he is a\\nking, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no\\ntime of suitability. He say, \\'I am here.\\' Behold, in example I grieve my\\nheart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though\\nI am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other\\nsufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very\\ngrave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her\\ncoffin and say \\'Thud! thud!\\' to my heart, till it send back the blood\\nfrom my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of\\nthe age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his\\nhair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet\\nwhen he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my\\nfather-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friend\\nJohn, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even\\nat such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,\\n\\'Here I am! here I am!\\' till the blood come dance back and bring some of\\nthe sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is\\na strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and\\ntroubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the\\ntune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and\\ntears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he\\nmake with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that\\nhe is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn\\ntight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,\\nlike the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain\\nbecome too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the\\nsunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with\\nour labour, what it may be.\"\\n\\n\\nI did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I\\ndid not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he\\nanswered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different\\ntone:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with\\nflowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she\\nwere truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely\\nchurchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother\\nwho loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going \\'Toll!\\ntoll! toll!\\' so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white\\ngarments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time\\ntheir eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all\\nfor what? She is dead; so! Is it not?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well, for the life of me, Professor,\" I said, \"I can\\'t see anything to\\nlaugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle\\nthan before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor\\nArt and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had\\nmade her truly his bride?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then\\nwhat about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,\\nand me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church\\'s law, though\\nno wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,\\nam bigamist.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see where the joke comes in there either!\" I said; and I did\\nnot feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid\\nhis hand on my arm, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others\\nwhen it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.\\nIf you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;\\nif you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so\\nnow, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for\\nhe go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you would\\nperhaps pity me the most of all.\"\\n\\n\\nI was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.\\n\\n\\n\"Because I know!\"\\n\\n\\nAnd now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will\\nsit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her\\nkin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming\\nLondon; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,\\nand where wild flowers grow of their own accord.\\n\\n\\nSo I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin\\nanother. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with\\ndifferent people and different themes; for here at the end, where the\\nromance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my\\nlife-work, I say sadly and without hope,\\n\\n\\n                        \"FINIS.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_\"The Westminster Gazette,\" 25 September._\\n\\n\\n                          A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a\\nseries of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what\\nwas known to the writers of headlines as \"The Kensington Horror,\" or\\n\"The Stabbing Woman,\" or \"The Woman in Black.\" During the past two or\\nthree days several cases have occurred of young children straying from\\nhome or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all\\nthese cases the children were too young to give any properly\\nintelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses\\nis that they had been with a \"bloofer lady.\" It has always been late in\\nthe evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the\\nchildren have not been found until early in the following morning. It is\\ngenerally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed\\ngave as his reason for being away that a \"bloofer lady\" had asked him to\\ncome for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as\\noccasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the\\nlittle ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A\\ncorrespondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to\\nbe the \"bloofer lady\" is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists\\nmight, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the\\nreality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general\\nprinciples of human nature that the \"bloofer lady\" should be the popular\\nrôle at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent naïvely says\\nthat even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of\\nthese grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine\\nthemselves--to be.\\n\\n\\nThere is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of\\nthe children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been\\nslightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be\\nmade by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance\\nindividually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has\\na system or method of its own. The police of the division have been\\ninstructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially\\nwhen very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog\\nwhich may be about.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               _\"The Westminster Gazette,\" 25 September._\\n\\n\\n                            _Extra Special._\\n\\n\\n                         THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR.\\n\\n\\n                         ANOTHER CHILD INJURED.\\n\\n\\n                         _The \"Bloofer Lady.\"_\\n\\n\\nWe have just received intelligence that another child, missed last\\nnight, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the\\nShooter\\'s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less\\nfrequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the\\nthroat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and\\nlooked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common\\nstory to tell of being lured away by the \"bloofer lady.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_23 September_.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that\\nhe has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible\\nthings; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the\\nresponsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,\\nand now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his\\nadvancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon\\nhim. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch\\nat home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal,\\nand lock myself up in my room and read it....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_24 September_.--I hadn\\'t the heart to write last night; that terrible\\nrecord of Jonathan\\'s upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered,\\nwhether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth\\nin it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those\\nterrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall\\nnever know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man\\nwe saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I\\nsuppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some\\ntrain of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our\\nwedding-day he said: \"Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to\\nthe bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.\" There seems to be\\nthrough it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was\\ncoming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his\\nteeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must\\nnot shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter\\nthis very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other\\neyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready,\\npoor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let\\nhim be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets\\nover the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him\\nquestions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._\\n\\n\\n\"_24 September._\\n\\n\\n(_Confidence_)\\n\\n\\n\"Dear Madam,--\\n\\n\\n\"I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that I\\nsent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra\\'s death. By the kindness of\\nLord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I am\\ndeeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I find\\nsome letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you\\nlove her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me. It is\\nfor others\\' good that I ask--to redress great wrong, and to lift much\\nand terrible troubles--that may be more great than you can know. May it\\nbe that I see you? You can trust me. I am friend of Dr. John Seward and\\nof Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep it private\\nfor the present from all. I should come to Exeter to see you at once if\\nyou tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when. I implore your\\npardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how good\\nyou are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if it may be,\\nenlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your pardon, and forgive me.\\n\\n\\n\"VAN HELSING.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Telegram, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._\\n\\n\\n\"_25 September._--Come to-day by quarter-past ten train if you can catch\\nit. Can see you any time you call.\\n\\n\\n\"WILHELMINA HARKER.\"\\n\\n\\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL.\\n\\n\\n_25 September._--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time\\ndraws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that\\nit will throw some light upon Jonathan\\'s sad experience; and as he\\nattended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about\\nher. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her\\nsleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real\\ntruth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my\\nimagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of\\ncourse it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that\\nawful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten\\nin my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him\\nof her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about\\nit; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may\\nunderstand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs.\\nWestenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even\\na negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van\\nHelsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of\\nlate that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.\\n\\n\\nI suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain\\ndoes. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and\\nthen Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day\\nand night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do\\nhope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will\\noccur to upset him. It is two o\\'clock, and the doctor will be here soon\\nnow. I shall say nothing of Jonathan\\'s journal unless he asks me. I am\\nso glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks\\nabout Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it\\nall makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all\\npossible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan\\'s journal\\nfirst, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear\\nJonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may\\nnot upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even\\na consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its\\nconsequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did\\nnot deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt\\nwhich haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter\\nwhich--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more\\nsatisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a\\ngood man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur\\'s friend and Dr.\\nSeward\\'s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after\\nLucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a\\nnoble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;\\nand then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good\\nend. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan\\'s\\nfriend on \"The Exeter News\" told him that memory was everything in such\\nwork--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word\\nspoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare\\ninterview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.\\n\\n\\nIt was half-past two o\\'clock when the knock came. I took my courage _à\\ndeux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and\\nannounced \"Dr. Van Helsing.\"\\n\\n\\nI rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,\\nstrongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and\\na neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise\\nof the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the\\nhead is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,\\nclean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile\\nmouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive\\nnostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the\\nmouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost\\nstraight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;\\nsuch a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,\\nbut falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set\\nwidely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man\\'s moods. He\\nsaid to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"Mrs. Harker, is it not?\" I bowed assent.\\n\\n\\n\"That was Miss Mina Murray?\" Again I assented.\\n\\n\\n\"It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear\\nchild Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Sir,\" I said, \"you could have no better claim on me than that you were\\na friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.\" And I held out my hand. He took\\nit and said tenderly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be\\ngood, but I had yet to learn----\" He finished his speech with a courtly\\nbow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at\\nonce began:--\\n\\n\\n\"I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin\\nto inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were\\nwith her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look\\nsurprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in\\nimitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain\\nthings to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In\\ngreat perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much\\nkindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always\\nso with young ladies.\"\\n\\n\\n\"No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you\\nif you like.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.\" I\\ncould not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is\\nsome of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our\\nmouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful\\nbow, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"May I read it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"If you wish,\" I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for\\nan instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, you so clever woman!\" he said. \"I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a\\nman of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.\\nAnd will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?\\nAlas! I know not the shorthand.\" By this time my little joke was over,\\nand I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my\\nworkbasket and handed it to him.\\n\\n\\n\"Forgive me,\" I said: \"I could not help it; but I had been thinking that\\nit was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not\\nhave time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must\\nbe precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you.\"\\n\\n\\nHe took it and his eyes glistened. \"You are so good,\" he said. \"And may\\nI read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.\"\\n\\n\\n\"By all means,\" I said, \"read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you\\ncan ask me questions whilst we eat.\" He bowed and settled himself in a\\nchair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,\\nwhilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be\\ndisturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down\\nthe room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and\\ntook me by both hands.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said, \"how can I say what I owe to you? This paper\\nis as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so\\nmuch light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that\\nyou do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so\\nclever woman. Madam\"--he said this very solemnly--\"if ever Abraham Van\\nHelsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.\\nIt will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a\\nfriend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you\\nand those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;\\nyou are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and\\nyour husband will be blessed in you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and\\nwomen; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to\\nhim and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you\\nhave so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every\\nline. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your\\nmarriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell\\nall their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that\\nangels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of\\nangels\\' eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for\\nyou trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your\\nhusband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and\\nis he strong and hearty?\" I saw here an opening to ask him about\\nJonathan, so I said:--\\n\\n\\n\"He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins\\'s\\ndeath.\" He interrupted:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.\" I went\\non:--\\n\\n\\n\"I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he\\nhad a sort of shock.\"\\n\\n\\n\"A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of\\na shock was it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something\\nwhich led to his brain fever.\" And here the whole thing seemed to\\noverwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he\\nexperienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that\\nhas been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I\\nwas hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to\\nhim, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands\\nand raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my\\nhand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--\\n\\n\\n\"My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not\\nhad much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by\\nmy friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such\\nnobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing\\nyears--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here\\nfull of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I\\nam seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life\\nhappy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for\\nthe children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some\\nuse to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my\\nstudy and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him\\nthat I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy\\none. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.\\nHusband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not\\nwhere he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat\\nand smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not\\nspeak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I\\nwant to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I\\nwill ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of\\nhusband Jonathan\\'s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat\\nnow; afterwards you shall tell me all.\"\\n\\n\\nAfter lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"And now tell me all about him.\" When it came to speaking to this great\\nlearned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and\\nJonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go\\non. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I\\ntrusted him, so I said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not\\nlaugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of\\nfever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I\\nhave even half believed some very strange things.\" He reassured me by\\nhis manner as well as his words when he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which\\nI am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little\\nof any one\\'s belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep\\nan open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close\\nit, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that\\nmake one doubt if they be mad or sane.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my\\nmind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,\\nbut I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and\\nJonathan\\'s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that\\nhappened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and\\njudge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell\\nme what you think.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I promise,\" he said as I gave him the papers; \"I shall in the morning,\\nso soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch\\nwith us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which\\nwill leave you at Paddington before eight.\" He was surprised at my\\nknowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made\\nup all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in\\ncase he is in a hurry.\\n\\n\\nSo he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here\\nthinking--thinking I don\\'t know what.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Letter (by hand), Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._\\n\\n\\n\"_25 September, 6 o\\'clock._\\n\\n\\n\"Dear Madam Mina,--\\n\\n\\n\"I have read your husband\\'s so wonderful diary. You may sleep without\\ndoubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is _true_! I will pledge my\\nlife on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no\\ndread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men,\\nthat one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that\\nroom--ay, and going a second time--is not one to be injured in\\npermanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right; this I\\nswear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much to\\nask him of other things.

And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in\\nthe world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really\\nin London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a\\nwire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from\\nLaunceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear\\nto-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come\\nto breakfast at eight o\\'clock, if this be not too early for you? You can\\nget away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring\\nyou to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that,\\nif I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.\\n\\n\\n\"Believe me,\\n\\n\\n\"Your faithful and grateful friend,\\n\\n\\n\"MINA HARKER.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_26 September._--I thought never to write in this diary again, but the\\ntime has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and\\nwhen we had supped she told me of Van Helsing\\'s visit, and of her having\\ngiven him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been\\nabout me. She showed me in the doctor\\'s letter that all I wrote down was\\ntrue. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the\\nreality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in\\nthe dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, even\\nof the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting\\nto London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing\\nis the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what\\nMina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I\\nshall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....\\n\\n\\nHe was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he\\nwas, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my\\nface round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--\\n\\n\\n\"But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.\" It was\\nso funny to hear my wife called \"Madam Mina\" by this kindly,\\nstrong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And how?\"\\n\\n\\n\"By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything\\ntook a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the\\nevidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know\\nwhat to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been\\nthe groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted\\nmyself. Doctor, you don\\'t know what it is to doubt everything, even\\nyourself. No, you don\\'t; you couldn\\'t with eyebrows like yours.\" He\\nseemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with\\nso much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will\\npardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.\" I\\nwould listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded\\nand stood silent.\\n\\n\\n\"She is one of God\\'s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and\\nother women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its\\nlight can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an\\negoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and\\nselfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,\\nand some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the\\nknowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You\\nwill give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our\\nlives.\"\\n\\n\\nWe shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite\\nchoky.\\n\\n\\n\"And now,\" he said, \"may I ask you for some more help? I have a great\\ntask to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.\\nCan you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I\\nmay ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Look here, sir,\" I said, \"does what you have to do concern the Count?\"\\n\\n\\n\"It does,\" he said solemnly.\\n\\n\\n\"Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you\\nwill not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.\\nYou can take them with you and read them in the train.\"\\n\\n\\nAfter breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he\\nsaid:--\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina\\ntoo.\"\\n\\n\\n\"We shall both come when you will,\" I said.\\n\\n\\nI had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous\\nnight, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the\\ntrain to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to\\ncatch something in one of them, \"The Westminster Gazette\"--I knew it by\\nthe colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently,\\ngroaning to himself: \"Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!\" I do not\\nthink he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and\\nthe train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of\\nthe window and waved his hand, calling out: \"Love to Madam Mina; I shall\\nwrite so soon as ever I can.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week\\nsince I said \"Finis,\" and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather\\ngoing on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to\\nthink of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as\\nhe ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had\\njust started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble\\nto me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I\\ngather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with\\nhim, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of\\ngood spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that\\nArthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to\\nthem all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my\\nwork with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might\\nfairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming\\ncicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the\\nend God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,\\ntoo, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He\\nwent to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came\\nback, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o\\'clock,\\nand thrust last night\\'s \"Westminster Gazette\" into my hand.\\n\\n\\n\"What do you think of that?\" he asked as he stood back and folded his\\narms.\\n\\n\\nI looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he\\ntook it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed\\naway at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a\\npassage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An\\nidea struck me, and I looked up. \"Well?\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\"It is like poor Lucy\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And what do you make of it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured\\nher has injured them.\" I did not quite understand his answer:--\\n\\n\\n\"That is true indirectly, but not directly.\"\\n\\n\\n\"How do you mean, Professor?\" I asked. I was a little inclined to take\\nhis seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom\\nfrom burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one\\'s spirits--but\\nwhen I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our\\ndespair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.\\n\\n\\n\"Tell me!\" I said. \"I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to\\nthink, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to\\nwhat poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by\\nevents, but by me?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And how the blood lost or waste?\" I shook my head. He stepped over and\\nsat down beside me, and went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;\\nbut you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears\\nhear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to\\nyou. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,\\nand yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But\\nthere are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men\\'s\\neyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men\\nhave told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to\\nexplain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to\\nexplain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,\\nwhich think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend\\nto be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not\\nbelieve in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor\\nin astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in\\nhypnotism----\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Charcot has proved that pretty well.\" He smiled as he\\nwent on: \"Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you\\nunderstand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great\\nCharcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patient\\nthat he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you\\nsimply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion\\nbe a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how you\\naccept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my\\nfriend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which\\nwould have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered\\nelectricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned\\nas wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that\\nMethuselah lived nine hundred years, and \\'Old Parr\\' one hundred and\\nsixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men\\'s blood in her poor\\nveins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we\\ncould have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do\\nyou know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the\\nqualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me\\nwhy, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived\\nfor centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,\\ntill, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can\\nyou tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that\\ncome at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their\\nveins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang\\non the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant\\nnuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that\\nit is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are\\nfound dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Good God, Professor!\" I said, starting up. \"Do you mean to tell me that\\nLucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London\\nin the nineteenth century?\" He waved his hand for silence, and went\\non:--\\n\\n\\n\"Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of\\nmen; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and\\nwhy the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?\\nCan you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are\\nsome few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and\\nwomen who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for the\\nfact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of\\nyears, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of\\nthe world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die\\nand have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the\\ncorn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men\\ncome and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian\\nfakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?\" Here\\nI interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind\\nhis list of nature\\'s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my\\nimagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me\\nsome lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but\\nhe used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of\\nthought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I\\nwanted to follow him, so I said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so\\nthat I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in\\nmy mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an\\nidea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping\\nfrom one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without\\nknowing where I am going.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That is good image,\" he said. \"Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is\\nthis: I want you to believe.\"\\n\\n\\n\"To believe what?\"\\n\\n\\n\"To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once\\nof an American who so defined faith: \\'that faculty which enables us to\\nbelieve things which we know to be untrue.\\' For one, I follow that man.\\nHe meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of\\ntruth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway\\ntruck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value\\nhim; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in\\nthe universe.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the\\nreceptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read\\nyour lesson aright?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now\\nthat you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to\\nunderstand. You think then that those so small holes in the children\\'s\\nthroats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I suppose so.\" He stood up and said solemnly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,\\nfar, far worse.\"\\n\\n\\n\"In God\\'s name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?\" I cried.\\n\\n\\nHe threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his\\nelbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"They were made by Miss Lucy!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--_continued_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life\\nstruck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to\\nhim:--\\n\\n\\n\"Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?\" He raised his head and looked at me, and\\nsomehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. \"Would I were!\" he\\nsaid. \"Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my\\nfriend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell\\nyou so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all\\nmy life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,\\nnow so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a\\nfearful death? Ah no!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Forgive me,\" said I. He went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,\\nfor I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not\\nexpect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract\\ntruth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always\\nbelieved the \\'no\\' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a\\nconcrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove\\nit. Dare you come with me?\"\\n\\n\\nThis staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron\\nexcepted from the category, jealousy.\\n\\n\\n    \"And prove the very truth he most abhorred.\"\\n\\n\\nHe saw my hesitation, and spoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"The logic is simple, no madman\\'s logic this time, jumping from tussock\\nto tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;\\nat worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet\\nvery dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,\\nI tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child\\nin the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers\\nsay the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were\\nin class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he\\nwill not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we\\nwish to learn. And then----\"\\n\\n\\n\"And then?\" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. \"And then we\\nspend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is\\nthe key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to\\nArthur.\" My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful\\nordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what\\nheart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was\\npassing....\\n\\n\\nWe found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and\\naltogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its\\nthroat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the\\nsimilarity to those which had been on Lucy\\'s throat. They were smaller,\\nand the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he\\nattributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some\\nanimal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think\\nthat it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern\\nheights of London. \"Out of so many harmless ones,\" he said, \"there may\\nbe some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some\\nsailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from\\nthe Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred\\nthere from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago\\na wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a\\nweek after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the\\nHeath and in every alley in the place until this \\'bloofer lady\\' scare\\ncame along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even\\nthis poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he\\nmight go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted\\nto play with the \\'bloofer lady.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\"I hope,\" said Van Helsing, \"that when you are sending the child home\\nyou will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies\\nto stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another\\nnight, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will\\nnot let it away for some days?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not\\nhealed.\"\\n\\n\\nOur visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and\\nthe sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it\\nwas, he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek\\nsomewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.\"\\n\\n\\nWe dined at \"Jack Straw\\'s Castle\" along with a little crowd of\\nbicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o\\'clock we\\nstarted from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps\\nmade the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual\\nradius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he\\nwent on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to\\nlocality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at\\nlast we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse\\npolice going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of\\nthe churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for\\nit was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found\\nthe Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,\\nand standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to\\nprecede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the\\ncourtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My\\ncompanion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after\\ncarefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,\\none. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he\\nfumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,\\nproceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed\\nwith fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some\\ndays afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites\\nturning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the\\nbeetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured\\nstone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished\\nbrass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a\\ncandle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been\\nimagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was\\nnot the only thing which could pass away.\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so\\nthat he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm\\ndropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he\\nmade assurance of Lucy\\'s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took\\nout a turnscrew.\\n\\n\\n\"What are you going to do?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n\"To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.\" Straightway he began\\ntaking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the\\ncasing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed\\nto be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have\\nstripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took\\nhold of his hand to stop him. He only said: \"You shall see,\" and again\\nfumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew\\nthrough the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he\\nmade a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of\\nthe saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We\\ndoctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to\\nsuch things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never\\nstopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of\\nthe lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the\\nedge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the\\ncoffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to\\nlook.\\n\\n\\nI drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.\\n\\n\\nIt was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but\\nVan Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,\\nand so emboldened to proceed in his task. \"Are you satisfied now, friend\\nJohn?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\nI felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as\\nI answered him:--\\n\\n\\n\"I am satisfied that Lucy\\'s body is not in that coffin; but that only\\nproves one thing.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And what is that, friend John?\"\\n\\n\\n\"That it is not there.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That is good logic,\" he said, \"so far as it goes. But how do you--how\\ncan you--account for it not being there?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps a body-snatcher,\" I suggested. \"Some of the undertaker\\'s people\\nmay have stolen it.\" I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was\\nthe only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. \"Ah\\nwell!\" he said, \"we must have more proof. Come with me.\"\\n\\n\\nHe put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed\\nthem in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the\\nbag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and\\nlocked it. He handed me the key, saying: \"Will you keep it? You had\\nbetter be assured.\" I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am\\nbound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. \"A key is nothing,\" I said;\\n\"there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock\\nof that kind.\" He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he\\ntold me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at\\nthe other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark\\nfigure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my\\nsight.\\n\\n\\nIt was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant\\nclock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and\\nunnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand\\nand with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly\\nobservant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had\\na dreary, miserable time.\\n\\n\\nSuddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white\\nstreak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard\\nfarthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the\\nProfessor\\'s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I\\ntoo moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I\\nstumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an\\nearly cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered\\njuniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim\\nfigure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden\\nby trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the\\nrustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and\\ncoming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When\\nhe saw me he held it out to me, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.\\n\\n\\n\"Do you not see the child?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?\" I\\nasked.\\n\\n\\n\"We shall see,\" said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way\\nout of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.\\n\\n\\nWhen we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of\\ntrees, and struck a match, and looked at the child\\'s throat. It was\\nwithout a scratch or scar of any kind.\\n\\n\\n\"Was I right?\" I asked triumphantly.\\n\\n\\n\"We were just in time,\" said the Professor thankfully.\\n\\n\\nWe had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted\\nabout it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to\\ngive some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should\\nhave had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.\\nSo finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we\\nheard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find\\nit; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out\\nwell. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman\\'s heavy\\ntramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until\\nhe saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation\\nof astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a\\ncab near the \"Spaniards,\" and drove to town.\\n\\n\\nI cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours\\'\\nsleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall\\ngo with him on another expedition.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_27 September._--It was two o\\'clock before we found a suitable\\nopportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,\\nand the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily\\naway, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw\\nthe sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till\\nmorning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not\\nwant more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the\\nreality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of\\nplace; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were\\nincurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.\\nOutrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead\\nnearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to\\nopen the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own\\neyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,\\nand rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,\\nno matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again\\ncourteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as\\nlast night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine\\nstreamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy\\'s coffin, and I followed.\\nHe bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock\\nof surprise and dismay shot through me.\\n\\n\\nThere lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her\\nfuneral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I\\ncould not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than\\nbefore; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.\\n\\n\\n\"Is this a juggle?\" I said to him.\\n\\n\\n\"Are you convinced now?\" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke\\nhe put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the\\ndead lips and showed the white teeth.\\n\\n\\n\"See,\" he went on, \"see, they are even sharper than before. With this\\nand this\"--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below\\nit--\"the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend\\nJohn?\" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not\\naccept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to\\nargue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--\\n\\n\\n\"She may have been placed here since last night.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed? That is so, and by whom?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I do not know. Some one has done it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not\\nlook so.\" I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not\\nseem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor\\ntriumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising\\nthe eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and\\nexamining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is\\nsome dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire\\nwhen she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know\\nthat, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could\\nhe best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she\\nis Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when\\nthe Un-Dead sleep at home\"--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of\\nhis arm to designate what to a vampire was \"home\"--\"their face show what\\nthey are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to\\nthe nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so\\nit make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.\" This turned my blood\\ncold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing\\'s\\ntheories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the\\nidea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in\\nmy face, for he said almost joyously:--\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, you believe now?\"\\n\\n\\nI answered: \"Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to\\naccept. How will you do this bloody work?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall\\ndrive a stake through her body.\" It made me shudder to think of so\\nmutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling\\nwas not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to\\nshudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing\\ncalled it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,\\nor all objective?\\n\\n\\nI waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as\\nif wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a\\nsnap, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I\\ndid simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is\\nto be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are\\nthousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is\\nsimple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act\\nnow would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to\\nwant Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the\\nwounds on Lucy\\'s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child\\'s at\\nthe hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full\\nto-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more\\nbeautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know\\nof the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,\\nand yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect\\nArthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I\\ntook him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me\\nbecause in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say\\ngood-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea\\nthis woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have\\nkilled her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that\\nhave killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet\\nhe never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will\\nsometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint\\nhis dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he\\nwill think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,\\nan Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since\\nI know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he\\nmust pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,\\nmust have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to\\nhim; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is\\nmade up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see\\nthat all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this\\nchurchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the\\nBerkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,\\nand also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we\\nshall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and\\nthere dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.\"\\n\\n\\nSo we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the\\nchurchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to\\nJohn Seward, M. D._\\n\\n\\n(Not delivered.)\\n\\n\\n\"_27 September._\\n\\n\\n\"Friend John,--\\n\\n\\n\"I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in\\nthat churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not\\nleave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.\\nTherefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a\\ncrucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,\\nand will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they\\nmay not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is\\ndesperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may\\nbe. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,\\nand if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss\\nLucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that\\nshe is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.\\nHe is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all\\nalong he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy\\'s life, and\\nwe lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the\\nstrength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength\\nto Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and\\nI know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall\\nfind me; but none other shall--until it be too late. But it may be that\\nhe will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his\\nhunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the\\nUn-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.\\n\\n\\n\"Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,\\nthe diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this\\ngreat Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake\\nthrough it, so that the world may rest from him.\\n\\n\\n\"If it be so, farewell.\\n\\n\\n\"VAN HELSING.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_28 September._--It is wonderful what a good night\\'s sleep will do for\\none. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing\\'s monstrous\\nideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on\\ncommon sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his\\nmind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_\\nrational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that\\nthe Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that\\nif he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to\\nsome fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed\\nit would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van\\nHelsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some\\nlight on the mystery.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o\\'clock,\\nArthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing\\'s room; he told us all that he\\nwanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all\\nour wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would\\nall come with him too, \"for,\" he said, \"there is a grave duty to be done\\nthere. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?\" This query was\\ndirectly addressed to Lord Godalming.\\n\\n\\n\"I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble\\naround my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been\\ncurious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the\\nmore we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself\\nthat I\\'m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Me too,\" said Quincey Morris laconically.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said the Professor, \"then you are nearer the beginning, both of\\nyou, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can\\neven get so far as to begin.\"\\n\\n\\nIt was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of\\nmind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said\\nwith intense gravity:--\\n\\n\\n\"I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I\\nknow, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will\\nknow, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me\\nin the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a\\ntime--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may\\nbe--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s frank anyhow,\" broke in Quincey. \"I\\'ll answer for the Professor.\\nI don\\'t quite see his drift, but I swear he\\'s honest; and that\\'s good\\nenough for me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I thank you, sir,\" said Van Helsing proudly. \"I have done myself the\\nhonour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear\\nto me.\" He held out a hand, which Quincey took.\\n\\n\\nThen Arthur spoke out:--\\n\\n\\n\"Dr. Van Helsing, I don\\'t quite like to \\'buy a pig in a poke,\\' as they\\nsay in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman\\nor my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.\\nIf you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of\\nthese two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I\\ncannot understand what you are driving at.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I accept your limitation,\" said Van Helsing, \"and all I ask of you is\\nthat if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first\\nconsider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your\\nreservations.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Agreed!\" said Arthur; \"that is only fair. And now that the\\n_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at\\nKingstead.\"\\n\\n\\nArthur\\'s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--\\n\\n\\n\"Where poor Lucy is buried?\" The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: \"And\\nwhen there?\"\\n\\n\\n\"To enter the tomb!\" Arthur stood up.\\n\\n\\n\"Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,\\nI see that you are in earnest.\" He sat down again, but I could see that\\nhe sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was\\nsilence until he asked again:--\\n\\n\\n\"And when in the tomb?\"\\n\\n\\n\"To open the coffin.\"\\n\\n\\n\"This is too much!\" he said, angrily rising again. \"I am willing to be\\npatient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration\\nof the grave--of one who----\" He fairly choked with indignation. The\\nProfessor looked pityingly at him.\\n\\n\\n\"If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,\" he said, \"God knows I\\nwould. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and\\nfor ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!\"\\n\\n\\nArthur looked up with set white face and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Take care, sir, take care!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?\" said Van Helsing.\\n\"And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go\\non?\"\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s fair enough,\" broke in Morris.\\n\\n\\nAfter a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--\\n\\n\\n\"Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to\\nher. But if she be not dead----\"\\n\\n\\nArthur jumped to his feet.\\n\\n\\n\"Good God!\" he cried. \"What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has\\nshe been buried alive?\" He groaned in anguish that not even hope could\\nsoften.\\n\\n\\n\"I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no\\nfurther than to say that she might be Un-Dead.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what\\nis it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they\\nmay solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But\\nI have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Heavens and earth, no!\" cried Arthur in a storm of passion. \"Not for\\nthe wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.\\nVan Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should\\ntorture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to\\ncast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or\\nam I mad to listen to them? Don\\'t dare to think more of such a\\ndesecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a\\nduty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do\\nit!\"\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and\\nsaid, gravely and sternly:--\\n\\n\\n\"My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty\\nto you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you\\nnow is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when\\nlater I make the same request you do not be more eager for its\\nfulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it\\nmay seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship\\'s wishes I shall\\nhold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where\\nyou will.\" His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of\\npity:--\\n\\n\\n\"But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of\\nacts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring\\nmy heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if\\nthe time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from\\nyou will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can\\nto save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so\\nmuch of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land\\nto do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and\\nthen to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I\\nam ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you\\ngave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her\\nlover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights\\nand days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good\\neven now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.\" He\\nsaid this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected\\nby it. He took the old man\\'s hand and said in a broken voice:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I\\nshall go with you and wait.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--_continued_\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was just a quarter before twelve o\\'clock when we got into the\\nchurchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams\\nof moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across\\nthe sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly\\nin front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked\\nwell at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so\\nsorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it\\nthat the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant\\nto his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural\\nhesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by\\nentering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.\\nHe then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped\\nforward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that\\ncoffin?\"\\n\\n\\n\"It was.\" The Professor turned to the rest saying:--\\n\\n\\n\"You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.\" He\\ntook his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur\\nlooked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped\\nforward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,\\nat any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,\\nthe blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away\\nagain, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.\\nVan Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and\\nrecoiled.\\n\\n\\nThe coffin was empty!\\n\\n\\nFor several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by\\nQuincey Morris:--\\n\\n\\n\"Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn\\'t ask\\nsuch a thing ordinarily--I wouldn\\'t so dishonour you as to imply a\\ndoubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.\\nIs this your doing?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor\\ntouched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and\\nI came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which\\nwas then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and\\nsaw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in\\nday-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,\\nand we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came\\nhere before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here\\nall the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable\\nthat it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,\\nwhich the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last\\nnight there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my\\ngarlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But\\nbear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me\\noutside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.\\nSo\"--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--\"now to the outside.\"\\nHe opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the\\ndoor behind him.\\n\\n\\nOh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of\\nthat vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing\\ngleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and\\npassing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man\\'s life; how sweet it was\\nto breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how\\nhumanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to\\nhear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each\\nin his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I\\ncould see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the\\nmystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to\\nthrow aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing\\'s conclusions. Quincey\\nMorris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and\\naccepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to\\nstake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of\\ntobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a\\ndefinite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like\\nthin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white\\nnapkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like\\ndough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the\\nmass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin\\nstrips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its\\nsetting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,\\nasked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near\\nalso, as they too were curious. He answered:--\\n\\n\\n\"I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?\" asked Quincey.\\n\"Great Scott! Is this a game?\"\\n\\n\\n\"It is.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What is that which you are using?\" This time the question was by\\nArthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--\\n\\n\\n\"The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.\" It was an\\nanswer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually\\nthat in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor\\'s, a\\npurpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was\\nimpossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places\\nassigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any\\none approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself\\nbeen apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,\\nwho had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink\\nwithin me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or\\nyew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree\\nor grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so\\nmysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a\\nwoeful presage through the night.\\n\\n\\nThere was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the\\nProfessor a keen \"S-s-s-s!\" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews\\nwe saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something\\ndark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of\\nmoonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling\\nprominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.\\nWe could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a\\nfair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a\\nchild gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We\\nwere starting forward, but the Professor\\'s warning hand, seen by us as\\nhe stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the\\nwhite figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see\\nclearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,\\nand I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of\\nLucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was\\nturned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous\\nwantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we\\nall advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the\\ntomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the\\nconcentrated light that fell on Lucy\\'s face we could see that the lips\\nwere crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her\\nchin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.\\n\\n\\nWe shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even\\nVan Helsing\\'s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had\\nnot seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.\\n\\n\\nWhen Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her\\nshape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives\\nwhen taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy\\'s eyes in form\\nand colour; but Lucy\\'s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of\\nthe pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love\\npassed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have\\ndone it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy\\nlight, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,\\nhow it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to\\nthe ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had\\nclutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls\\nover a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There\\nwas a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when\\nshe advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell\\nback and hid his face in his hands.\\n\\n\\nShe still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,\\nsaid:--\\n\\n\\n\"Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are\\nhungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!\"\\n\\n\\nThere was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the\\ntingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us\\nwho heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under\\na spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She\\nwas leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between\\nthem his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a\\nsuddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter\\nthe tomb.\\n\\n\\nWhen within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if\\narrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was\\nshown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no\\nquiver from Van Helsing\\'s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled\\nmalice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by\\nmortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw\\nout sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of\\nthe flesh were the coils of Medusa\\'s snakes, and the lovely,\\nblood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of\\nthe Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could\\nkill--we saw it at that moment.\\n\\n\\nAnd so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained\\nbetween the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of\\nentry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--\\n\\n\\n\"Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?\"\\n\\n\\nArthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he\\nanswered:--\\n\\n\\n\"Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like\\nthis ever any more;\" and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I\\nsimultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the\\nclick of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close\\nto the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred\\nemblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified\\namazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal\\nbody as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice\\nwhere scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of\\nrelief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty\\nto the edges of the door.\\n\\n\\nWhen this was done, he lifted the child and said:\\n\\n\\n\"Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a\\nfuneral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The\\nfriends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock\\nthe gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of\\nto-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow\\nnight he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find\\nhim, as on the other night; and then to home.\" Coming close to Arthur,\\nhe said:--\\n\\n\\n\"My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look\\nback, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter\\nwaters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have\\npassed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn\\novermuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.\"\\n\\n\\nArthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other\\non the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all\\nslept with more or less reality of sleep.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o\\'clock we three--Arthur,\\nQuincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to\\nnotice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of\\ncourse, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of\\nus wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and\\nstrolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the\\ngravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief\\nthat every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to\\nourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a\\nlong leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of\\nfair weight.\\n\\n\\nWhen we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up\\nthe road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the\\nProfessor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it\\nbehind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also\\ntwo wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own\\nends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work\\nby. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy\\'s coffin we all looked--Arthur\\ntrembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its\\ndeath-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but\\nloathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy\\'s shape without her\\nsoul. I could see even Arthur\\'s face grow hard as he looked. Presently\\nhe said to Van Helsing:--\\n\\n\\n\"Is this really Lucy\\'s body, or only a demon in her shape?\"\\n\\n\\n\"It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her\\nas she was, and is.\"\\n\\n\\nShe seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,\\nthe bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to\\nsee--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a\\ndevilish mockery of Lucy\\'s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual\\nmethodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and\\nplacing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some\\nplumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in\\na corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue\\nflame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a\\nround wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about\\nthree feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and\\nwas sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such\\nas in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To\\nme, a doctor\\'s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and\\nbracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was\\nto cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their\\ncourage, and remained silent and quiet.\\n\\n\\nWhen all was ready, Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and\\nexperience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers\\nof the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the\\ncurse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age\\nadding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that\\ndie from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey\\non their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the\\nripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met\\nthat kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night\\nwhen you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,\\nhave become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would\\nall time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.\\nThe career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those\\nchildren whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if\\nshe live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her\\npower over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that\\nso wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny\\nwounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays\\nunknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when\\nthis now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor\\nlady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by\\nnight and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she\\nshall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will\\nbe a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.\\nTo this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better\\nright? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the\\nnight when sleep is not: \\'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it\\nwas the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would\\nherself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?\\' Tell me if there be\\nsuch a one amongst us?\"\\n\\n\\nWe all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite\\nkindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore\\nLucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and\\nsaid bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as\\nsnow:--\\n\\n\\n\"My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me\\nwhat I am to do, and I shall not falter!\" Van Helsing laid a hand on his\\nshoulder, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Brave lad! A moment\\'s courage, and it is done. This stake must be\\ndriven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in\\nthat--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more\\nthan your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though\\nyou tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only\\nthink that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for\\nyou all the time.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Go on,\" said Arthur hoarsely. \"Tell me what I am to do.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the\\nheart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for\\nthe dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall\\nfollow--strike in God\\'s name, that so all may be well with the dead that\\nwe love and that the Un-Dead pass away.\"\\n\\n\\nArthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on\\naction his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened\\nhis missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we\\ncould. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could\\nsee its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.\\n\\n\\nThe Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech\\ncame from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted\\nin wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the\\nlips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur\\nnever faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm\\nrose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst\\nthe blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His\\nface was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it\\ngave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little\\nvault.\\n\\n\\nAnd then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the\\nteeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The\\nterrible task was over.\\n\\n\\nThe hammer fell from Arthur\\'s hand. He reeled and would have fallen had\\nwe not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,\\nand his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain\\non him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human\\nconsiderations he could never have gone through with it. For a few\\nminutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the\\ncoffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one\\nto the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had\\nbeen seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,\\nstrange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of\\nhorror that lay upon it.\\n\\n\\nThere, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded\\nand grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a\\nprivilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in\\nher life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that\\nthere were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and\\npain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth\\nto what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like\\nsunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and\\nsymbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur\\'s shoulder, and said to\\nhim:--\\n\\n\\n\"And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?\"\\n\\n\\nThe reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man\\'s hand\\nin his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,\\nand me peace.\" He put his hands on the Professor\\'s shoulder, and laying\\nhis head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood\\nunmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--\\n\\n\\n\"And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as\\nshe would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning\\ndevil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is\\nthe devil\\'s Un-Dead. She is God\\'s true dead, whose soul is with Him!\"\\n\\n\\nArthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the\\ntomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point\\nof it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with\\ngarlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,\\nand gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked\\nthe door he gave the key to Arthur.\\n\\n\\nOutside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it\\nseemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was\\ngladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves\\non one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.\\n\\n\\nBefore we moved away Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing\\nto ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author\\nof all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can\\nfollow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in\\nit, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all\\nof us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do\\nwe not promise to go on to the bitter end?\"\\n\\n\\nEach in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the\\nProfessor as we moved off:--\\n\\n\\n\"Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of\\nthe clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you\\nknow not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans\\nunfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult\\nabout, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall\\nreturn to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I\\nshall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.\\nThen our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a\\nterrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we\\nmust not draw back.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--_continued_\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram\\nwaiting for him:--\\n\\n\\n     \"Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINA\\n     HARKER.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Professor was delighted. \"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,\" he said,\\n\"pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your\\nhouse, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _en\\nroute_, so that she may be prepared.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of\\na diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten\\ncopy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker\\'s diary at Whitby. \"Take these,\" he\\nsaid, \"and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of\\nall the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep\\nthem safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your\\nfaith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What\\nis here told,\" he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of\\npapers as he spoke, \"may be the beginning of the end to you and me and\\nmany another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the\\nearth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in\\nany way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have\\nkept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we\\nshall go through all these together when we meet.\" He then made ready\\nfor his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I\\ntook my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before\\nthe train came in.\\n\\n\\nThe crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival\\nplatforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my\\nguest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,\\nafter a quick glance, said: \"Dr. Seward, is it not?\"\\n\\n\\n\"And you are Mrs. Harker!\" I answered at once; whereupon she held out\\nher hand.\\n\\n\\n\"I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----\" She stopped\\nsuddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.\\n\\n\\nThe blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it\\nwas a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a\\ntypewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had\\nsent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom\\nprepared at once for Mrs. Harker.\\n\\n\\nIn due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a\\nlunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder\\nwhen we entered.\\n\\n\\nShe told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as\\nshe had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph\\ndiary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at\\nthe papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before\\nme. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an\\nopportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or\\nwhat a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here\\nshe is!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward\\'s\\nstudy. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking\\nwith some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at\\nthe door, and on his calling out, \"Come in,\" I entered.\\n\\n\\nTo my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,\\nand on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the\\ndescription to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much\\ninterested.\\n\\n\\n\"I hope I did not keep you waiting,\" I said; \"but I stayed at the door\\nas I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh,\" he replied with a smile, \"I was only entering my diary.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Your diary?\" I asked him in surprise.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"I keep it in this.\" As he spoke he laid his hand on\\nthe phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--\\n\\n\\n\"Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train\\nfor speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.\\n\\n\\n\"The fact is,\" he began awkwardly, \"I only keep my diary in it; and as\\nit is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that\\nis, I mean----\" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his\\nembarrassment:--\\n\\n\\n\"You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;\\nfor all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very\\ndear to me.\"\\n\\n\\nTo my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--\\n\\n\\n\"Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Why not?\" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.\\nAgain he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.\\nAt length he stammered out:--\\n\\n\\n\"You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the\\ndiary.\" Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said\\nwith unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïveté\\nof a child: \"That\\'s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!\" I could\\nnot but smile, at which he grimaced. \"I gave myself away that time!\" he\\nsaid. \"But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months\\npast, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular\\npart of it in case I wanted to look it up?\" By this time my mind was\\nmade up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have\\nsomething to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and\\nI said boldly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my\\ntypewriter.\" He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn\\'t let you know that terrible\\nstory!\"\\n\\n\\nThen it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,\\nand as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or\\nsome opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on\\nthe table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,\\nfollowed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.\\n\\n\\n\"You do not know me,\" I said. \"When you have read those papers--my own\\ndiary and my husband\\'s also, which I have typed--you will know me\\nbetter. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in\\nthis cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not\\nexpect you to trust me so far.\"\\n\\n\\nHe is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about\\nhim. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in\\norder a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and\\nsaid:--\\n\\n\\n\"You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.\\nBut I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long\\nago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make\\nthe only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the\\nfirst half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify\\nyou; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the\\nmeantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better\\nable to understand certain things.\" He carried the phonograph himself up\\nto my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something\\npleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love\\nepisode of which I know one side already....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan\\nHarker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without\\nthinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce\\ndinner, so I said: \"She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,\" and\\nI went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker\\'s diary, when\\nshe came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were\\nflushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had\\ncause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and\\nnow the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went\\nstraight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--\\n\\n\\n\"I greatly fear I have distressed you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no, not distressed me,\" she replied, \"but I have been more touched\\nthan I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is\\ncruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.\\nIt was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them\\nspoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the\\nwords on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as\\nI did.\"\\n\\n\\n\"No one need ever know, shall ever know,\" I said in a low voice. She\\nlaid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, but they must!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Must! But why?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n\"Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy\\'s\\ndeath and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have\\nbefore us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all\\nthe knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the\\ncylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;\\nbut I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark\\nmystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain\\npoint; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September,\\nhow poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought\\nout. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van\\nHelsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he\\nwill be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;\\nworking together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than\\nif some of us were in the dark.\" She looked at me so appealingly, and at\\nthe same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,\\nthat I gave in at once to her wishes. \"You shall,\" I said, \"do as you\\nlike in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible\\nthings yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to\\npoor Lucy\\'s death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the\\ndark. Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace. Come,\\nthere is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;\\nwe have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn\\nthe rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything\\nwhich you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were\\npresent.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He\\nbrought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He\\nplaced me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I\\ncould touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case\\nI should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his\\nback to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I\\nput the forked metal to my ears and listened.\\n\\n\\nWhen the terrible story of Lucy\\'s death, and--and all that followed, was\\ndone, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a\\nfainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a\\nhorrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a\\ncupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored\\nme. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all\\nthe multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy\\nwas at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without\\nmaking a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I\\nhad not known Jonathan\\'s experience in Transylvania I could not have\\nbelieved. As it was, I didn\\'t know what to believe, and so got out of my\\ndifficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my\\ntypewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--\\n\\n\\n\"Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing\\nwhen he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when\\nhe arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,\\nand I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item\\nput in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that\\nLord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him\\nwhen they come.\" He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I\\nbegan to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used\\nmanifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with\\nall the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about\\nhis work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he\\ncame back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely\\nwhilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of\\ngood men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I\\nremembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor\\'s\\nperturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at\\nExeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the\\nfiles of \"The Westminster Gazette\" and \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" and took\\nthem to my room. I remember how much \"The Dailygraph\" and \"The Whitby\\nGazette,\" of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the\\nterrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look\\nthrough the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new\\nlight. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_30 September._--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o\\'clock. He had got his\\nwife\\'s wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can\\njudge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true--and\\njudging by one\\'s own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a man\\nof great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a\\nremarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was\\nprepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,\\nbusiness-like gentleman who came here to-day.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,\\nand as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They\\nare hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in\\nchronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got\\nthe letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the\\ncarriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife\\'s\\ntypescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it\\nis....\\n\\n\\n     Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be\\n     the Count\\'s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues\\n     from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters\\n     relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,\\n     if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!\\n     Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again\\n     collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be\\n     able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the\\n     meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of\\n     index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,\\n     but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing\\n     that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have\\n     found the dates otherwise....\\n\\n\\n     I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands\\n     folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any\\n     one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of\\n     subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own\\n     accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my\\n     knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite\\n     confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I\\n     not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of\\n     his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a\\n     brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All\\n     those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the\\n     Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that\\n     his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire\\'s ultimate triumph?\\n     Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the\\n     chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of \"master.\" This\\n     all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came\\n     away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it\\n     safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,\\n     and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so\\n     I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to\\n     have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_29 September, in train to London._--When I received Mr. Billington\\'s\\ncourteous message that he would give me any information in his power I\\nthought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such\\ninquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo\\nof the Count\\'s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal\\nwith it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and\\nbrought me to his father\\'s house, where they had decided that I must\\nstay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:\\ngive a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all\\nknew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had\\nready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.\\nIt gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had\\nseen on the Count\\'s table before I knew of his diabolical plans.\\nEverything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and\\nwith precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which\\nmight be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried\\nout. To use an Americanism, he had \"taken no chances,\" and the absolute\\naccuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the\\nlogical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:\\n\"Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.\"\\nAlso the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of\\nthese I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could\\ngive me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs\\nofficers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the\\nstrange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local\\ntradition; but no one could add to the simple description \"Fifty cases\\nof common earth.\" I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in\\ncommunication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their\\ntally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that\\nthe boxes were \"main and mortal heavy,\" and that shifting them was dry\\nwork. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn\\'t any\\ngentleman \"such-like as yourself, squire,\" to show some sort of\\nappreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider\\nthat the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had\\nelapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care\\nbefore leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of\\nreproach.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line to\\nhis old companion the station-master at King\\'s Cross, so that when I\\narrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of\\nthe boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper\\nofficials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original\\ninvoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here\\nlimited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was\\ncompelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.\\n\\n\\nFrom thence I went on to Carter Paterson\\'s central office, where I met\\nwith the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their\\nday-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King\\'s Cross\\noffice for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming\\nwere waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending\\nalso by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the\\ndelivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing\\nexactly; the carriers\\' men were able to supplement the paucity of the\\nwritten words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected\\nalmost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent\\nthirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,\\nthrough the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a\\nlater period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--\\n\\n\\n\"That \\'ere \\'ouse, guv\\'nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it\\nain\\'t been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in\\nthe place that you might have slep\\' on it without \\'urtin\\' of yer bones;\\nan\\' the place was that neglected that yer might \\'ave smelled ole\\nJerusalem in it. But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! Me\\nand my mate, we thort we wouldn\\'t never git out quick enough. Lor\\', I\\nwouldn\\'t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what\\nI know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.\\n\\n\\nOf one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at\\nWhitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the old\\nchapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have\\nsince been removed--as from Dr. Seward\\'s diary I fear.\\n\\n\\nI shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when\\nRenfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good\\ndeal.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers\\ninto order.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal_\\n\\n\\n_30 September._--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.\\nIt is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had:\\nthat this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act\\ndetrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a\\nface as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,\\nhowever, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never\\nso full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good\\nProfessor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under\\nstrain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and\\nhope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I\\nfeel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any\\nthing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not\\nhuman--not even beast. To read Dr. Seward\\'s account of poor Lucy\\'s\\ndeath, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in\\none\\'s heart.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we\\nexpected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with\\nhim, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it\\nbrought back all poor dear Lucy\\'s hopes of only a few months ago. Of\\ncourse they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van\\nHelsing, too, has been quite \"blowing my trumpet,\" as Mr. Morris\\nexpressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all\\nabout the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to\\nsay or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they\\nhad to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and\\ncame to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post\\nthem in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward\\'s diary that\\nthey had been at Lucy\\'s death--her real death--and that I need not fear\\nto betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I\\ncould, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband\\nand I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.\\nI gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got\\nhis and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?\"\\n\\n\\nI nodded, and he went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and\\nkind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all\\nI can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have\\nhad one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble\\nto the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--\"\\nHere he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear\\nthe tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid\\na hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the\\nroom. I suppose there is something in woman\\'s nature that makes a man\\nfree to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or\\nemotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when\\nLord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and\\ngave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I\\nhope he didn\\'t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it\\nafterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I\\n_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I\\ncould see that his heart was breaking:--\\n\\n\\n\"I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to\\nher. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let\\nme be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have\\nhad, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can\\nhelp in your affliction, won\\'t you let me be of some little service--for\\nLucy\\'s sake?\"\\n\\n\\nIn an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed\\nto me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a\\nvent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat\\nhis palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat\\ndown again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite\\npity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his\\nhead on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with\\nemotion.\\n\\n\\nWe women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above\\nsmaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big\\nsorrowing man\\'s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby\\nthat some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he\\nwere my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.\\n\\n\\nAfter a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an\\napology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for\\ndays and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been\\nunable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of\\nsorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with\\nwhom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was\\nsurrounded, he could speak freely. \"I know now how I suffered,\" he said,\\nas he dried his eyes, \"but I do not know even yet--and none other can\\never know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall\\nknow better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful\\nnow, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be\\nlike a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy\\'s sake?\"\\n\\n\\n\"For dear Lucy\\'s sake,\" I said as we clasped hands. \"Ay, and for your\\nown sake,\" he added, \"for if a man\\'s esteem and gratitude are ever worth\\nthe winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring\\nto you a time when you need a man\\'s help, believe me, you will not call\\nin vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the\\nsunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you\\nwill let me know.\" He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that\\nI felt it would comfort him, so I said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I promise.\"\\n\\n\\nAs I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.\\nHe turned as he heard my footsteps. \"How is Art?\" he said. Then noticing\\nmy red eyes, he went on: \"Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor\\nold fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in\\ntrouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.\"\\n\\n\\nHe bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the\\nmanuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise\\nhow much I knew; so I said to him:--\\n\\n\\n\"I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me\\nbe your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You\\nwill know, later on, why I speak.\" He saw that I was in earnest, and\\nstooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed\\nbut poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I\\nbent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a\\nmomentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long\\nas ever you live!\" Then he went into the study to his friend.\\n\\n\\n\"Little girl!\"--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he\\nproved himself a friend!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_30 September._--I got home at five o\\'clock, and found that Godalming\\nand Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript\\nof the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife\\nhad made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the\\ncarriers\\' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave\\nus a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I\\nhave lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had\\nfinished, Mrs. Harker said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.\\nRenfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary\\ninterests me so much!\" She looked so appealing and so pretty that I\\ncould not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so\\nI took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a\\nlady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n\"She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,\" I\\nanswered. \"Oh, very well,\" he said; \"let her come in, by all means; but\\njust wait a minute till I tidy up the place.\" His method of tidying was\\npeculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes\\nbefore I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was\\njealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting\\ntask, he said cheerfully: \"Let the lady come in,\" and sat down on the\\nedge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that\\nhe could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might\\nhave some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just\\nbefore he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I\\ncould seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She\\ncame into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command\\nthe respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad\\npeople most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and\\nheld out her hand.\\n\\n\\n\"Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,\" said she. \"You see, I know you, for Dr.\\nSeward has told me of you.\" He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all\\nover intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one\\nof wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he\\nsaid:--\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can\\'t be,\\nyou know, for she\\'s dead.\" Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever\\nsaw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Then what are you doing here?\"\\n\\n\\n\"My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Then don\\'t stay.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But why not?\" I thought that this style of conversation might not be\\npleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--\\n\\n\\n\"How did you know I wanted to marry any one?\" His reply was simply\\ncontemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.\\nHarker to me, instantly turning them back again:--\\n\\n\\n\"What an asinine question!\"\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,\" said Mrs. Harker, at once\\nchampioning me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as\\nhe had shown contempt to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so\\nloved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of\\ninterest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his\\nhousehold and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of\\nthem hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and\\neffects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I\\ncannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates\\nlean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.\" I\\npositively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet\\nlunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met\\nwith--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished\\ngentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker\\'s presence which had touched\\nsome chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any\\nway due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or\\npower.\\n\\n\\nWe continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly\\nquite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she\\nbegan, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for\\nhe addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the\\ncompletest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned\\ncertain things.\\n\\n\\n\"Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,\\nit was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being\\nput under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and\\nperpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no\\nmatter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong\\nlife. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to\\ntake human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I\\ntried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by\\nthe assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his\\nblood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, \\'For the blood is\\nthe life.\\' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has\\nvulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn\\'t that true,\\ndoctor?\" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to\\neither think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up\\nhis spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I\\nsaw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.\\nHarker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying\\npleasantly to Mr. Renfield: \"Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,\\nunder auspices pleasanter to yourself,\" to which, to my astonishment, he\\nreplied:--\\n\\n\\n\"Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.\\nMay He bless and keep you!\"\\n\\n\\nWhen I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind\\nme. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took\\nill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for\\nmany a long day.\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a\\nboy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come\\nhere to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have\\nmuch to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And\\nArthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!\"\\n\\n\\nAs I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own\\ndiary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker\\'s suggestion; at\\nwhich the Professor interrupted me:--\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man\\'s brain--a brain that a man\\nshould have were he much gifted--and a woman\\'s heart. The good God\\nfashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good\\ncombination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help\\nto us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible\\naffair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are\\ndetermined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is\\nno part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her\\nin so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in\\nwaking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,\\nshe is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to\\nthink of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she\\nmust consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and\\nwe go alone.\" I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we\\nhad found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was\\nthe very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed\\nto come on him. \"Oh that we had known it before!\" he said, \"for then we\\nmight have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, \\'the milk\\nthat is spilt cries not out afterwards,\\' as you say. We shall not think\\nof that, but go on our way to the end.\" Then he fell into a silence that\\nlasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for\\ndinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--\\n\\n\\n\"I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have\\nput up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Not up to this moment, Professor,\" she said impulsively, \"but up to\\nthis morning.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the\\nlittle things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who\\nhas told is the worse for it.\"\\n\\n\\nMrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she\\nsaid:--\\n\\n\\n\"Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It\\nis my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at\\npresent everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except\\nwhat is personal. Must it go in?\" The Professor read it over gravely,\\nand handed it back, saying:--\\n\\n\\n\"It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can\\nbut make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more\\nhonour you--as well as more esteem and love.\" She took it back with\\nanother blush and a bright smile.\\n\\n\\nAnd so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete\\nand in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,\\nand before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o\\'clock. The rest of us\\nhave already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all\\nbe informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this\\nterrible and mysterious enemy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward\\'s study two hours after\\ndinner, which had been at six o\\'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of\\nboard or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to\\nwhich Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit\\nnext to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat\\nnext to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.\\nMorris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the\\ncentre. The Professor said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts\\nthat are in these papers.\" We all expressed assent, and he went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of\\nenemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you\\nsomething of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.\\nSo we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure\\naccording.\\n\\n\\n\"There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they\\nexist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the\\nteachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane\\npeoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that\\nthrough long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not\\nhave believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. \\'See! see!\\nI prove; I prove.\\' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,\\nhad I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of\\nus who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other\\npoor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die\\nlike the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being\\nstronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is\\namongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of\\ncunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have\\nstill the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the\\ndivination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are\\nfor him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in\\ncallous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear\\nat will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he\\ncan, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the\\nthunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and\\nthe bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become\\nsmall; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to\\nbegin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having\\nfound it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible\\ntask that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave\\nshudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then\\nwhere end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not\\nmere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward\\nbecome foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,\\npreying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for\\never are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?\\nWe go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God\\'s\\nsunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face\\nto face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;\\nbut then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his\\nsong of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are\\nyoung. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What\\nsay you?\"\\n\\n\\nWhilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so\\nmuch, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I\\nsaw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so\\nstrong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man\\'s hand can speak for\\nitself; it does not even need a woman\\'s love to hear its music.\\n\\n\\nWhen the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I\\nin his; there was no need for speaking between us.\\n\\n\\n\"I answer for Mina and myself,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\"Count me in, Professor,\" said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.\\n\\n\\n\"I am with you,\" said Lord Godalming, \"for Lucy\\'s sake, if for no other\\nreason.\"\\n\\n\\nDr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his\\ngolden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took\\nhis right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with\\nhis left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our\\nsolemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even\\noccur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing\\nwent on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work\\nhad begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,\\nas any other transaction of life:--\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not\\nwithout strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power\\ndenied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to\\nact and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.\\nIn fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are\\nfree to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to\\nachieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.\\n\\n\\n\"Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are\\nrestrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the\\nlimitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.\\n\\n\\n\"All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not\\nat the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay\\nof more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the\\nfirst place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and\\nsecondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and\\nsuperstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for\\nothers--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would\\nhave received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,\\nsceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief\\nthat we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the\\nvampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the\\nmoment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere\\nthat men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany\\nall over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so\\nfar from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at\\nthis day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the\\ndevil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we\\nhave all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the\\nbeliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy\\nexperience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the\\ntime; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the\\nliving. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow\\nyounger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though\\nthey refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he\\ncannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend\\nJonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!\\nHe throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again\\nJonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again\\nJonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him\\nfrom the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather\\nfrom the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as\\nbat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John\\nsaw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at\\nthe window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble\\nship\\'s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance\\nhe can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He\\ncome on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those\\nsisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw\\nMiss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the\\ntomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or\\ninto anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with\\nfire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,\\nin a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me\\nthrough. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even\\nmore prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.\\nHe cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey\\nsome of nature\\'s laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the\\nfirst, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;\\nthough afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does\\nthat of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times\\ncan he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is\\nbound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.\\nThese things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by\\ninference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he\\nhave his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place\\nunhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at\\nWhitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is\\nsaid, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood\\nof the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no\\npower, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this\\nsymbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to\\nthem he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and\\nsilent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,\\nlest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his\\ncoffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the\\ncoffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through\\nhim, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.\\nWe have seen it with our eyes.\\n\\n\\n\"Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine\\nhim to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is\\nclever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to\\nmake his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he\\nhas been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his\\nname against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of\\nTurkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,\\nand for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most\\ncunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the \\'land beyond the\\nforest.\\' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his\\ngrave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says\\nArminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who\\nwere held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They\\nlearned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake\\nHermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the\\nrecords are such words as \\'stregoica\\'--witch, \\'ordog,\\' and\\n\\'pokol\\'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is\\nspoken of as \\'wampyr,\\' which we all understand too well. There have been\\nfrom the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their\\ngraves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it\\nis not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in\\nall good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.\"\\n\\n\\nWhilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,\\nand he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little\\npause, and then the Professor went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must\\nproceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan\\nthat from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which\\nwere delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes\\nhave been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to\\nascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall\\nwhere we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the\\nlatter, we must trace----\"\\n\\n\\nHere we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came\\nthe sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a\\nbullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the\\nfar wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked\\nout. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the\\nwindow and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris\\'s voice\\nwithout:--\\n\\n\\n\"Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about\\nit.\" A minute later he came in and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.\\nHarker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But\\nthe fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat\\nand sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned\\nbrutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to\\nhave a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have\\nseen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Did you hit it?\" asked Dr. Van Helsing.\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.\" Without\\nsaying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his\\nstatement:--\\n\\n\\n\"We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must\\neither capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to\\nspeak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.\\nThus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of\\nnoon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.\\n\\n\\n\"And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.\\nYou are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you\\nno more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men\\nand are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we\\nshall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we\\nare.\"\\n\\n\\nAll the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me\\ngood that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their\\nsafety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their\\nminds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,\\nI could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.\\n\\n\\nMr. Morris resumed the discussion:--\\n\\n\\n\"As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right\\nnow. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save\\nanother victim.\"\\n\\n\\nI own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so\\nclose, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I\\nappeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave\\nme out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,\\nwith means to get into the house.\\n\\n\\nManlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can\\nsleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend\\nto sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an\\nurgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see\\nhim at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.\\nI told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the\\nmorning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--\\n\\n\\n\"He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don\\'t\\nknow but what, if you don\\'t see him soon, he will have one of his\\nviolent fits.\" I knew the man would not have said this without some\\ncause, so I said: \"All right; I\\'ll go now\"; and I asked the others to\\nwait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my \"patient.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Take me with you, friend John,\" said the Professor. \"His case in your\\ndiary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_\\ncase. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is\\ndisturbed.\"\\n\\n\\n\"May I come also?\" asked Lord Godalming.\\n\\n\\n\"Me too?\" said Quincey Morris. \"May I come?\" said Harker. I nodded, and\\nwe all went down the passage together.\\n\\n\\nWe found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more\\nrational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an\\nunusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever\\nmet with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would\\nprevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but\\nnone of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would\\nat once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up\\nwith arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own\\nexisting sanity. \"I appeal to your friends,\" he said, \"they will,\\nperhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have\\nnot introduced me.\" I was so much astonished, that the oddness of\\nintroducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,\\nbesides, there was a certain dignity in the man\\'s manner, so much of\\nthe habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: \"Lord\\nGodalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.\\nRenfield.\" He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--\\n\\n\\n\"Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the\\nWindham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no\\nmore. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his\\nyouth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much\\npatronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great\\nstate. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have\\nfar-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold\\nalliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a\\nvast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true\\nplace as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at\\nmeeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of\\nconventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics\\nby his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,\\nconventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to\\none of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by\\nthe possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective\\nplaces in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at\\nleast the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.\\nAnd I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as\\nwell as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to\\nbe considered as under exceptional circumstances.\" He made this last\\nappeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own\\ncharm.\\n\\n\\nI think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the\\nconviction, despite my knowledge of the man\\'s character and history,\\nthat his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to\\ntell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the\\nnecessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it\\nbetter to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old\\nI knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.\\nSo I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared\\nto be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him\\nin the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of\\nmeeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said\\nquickly:--\\n\\n\\n\"But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to\\ngo at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time\\npresses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of\\nthe essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put\\nbefore so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so\\nmomentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.\" He looked at me keenly, and\\nseeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised\\nthem closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?\"\\n\\n\\n\"You have,\" I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.\\nThere was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for\\nthis concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore\\nin such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I\\nam not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I\\nassure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and\\nunselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,\\nsir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which\\nanimate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of\\nyour friends.\" Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing\\nconviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was\\nbut yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let\\nhim go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like\\nall lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at\\nhim with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting\\nwith the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone\\nwhich did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it\\nafterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--\\n\\n\\n\"Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free\\nto-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,\\nwithout prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.\\nSeward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the\\nprivilege you seek.\" He shook his head sadly, and with a look of\\npoignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the\\nhighest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete\\nreasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since\\nyou are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If\\nyou will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can\\nwe perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help\\nus; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.\" He still shook\\nhis head as he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and\\nif I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my\\nown master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am\\nrefused, the responsibility does not rest with me.\" I thought it was now\\ntime to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went\\ntowards the door, simply saying:--\\n\\n\\n\"Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.\"\\n\\n\\nAs, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He\\nmoved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was\\nabout to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were\\ngroundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his\\npetition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his\\nemotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old\\nrelations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,\\nand saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more\\nfixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his\\nefforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same\\nconstantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of\\nwhich at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he\\nwanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same\\nsullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,\\nfor, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into\\nquite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up\\nhis hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a\\ntorrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his\\nwhole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--\\n\\n\\n\"Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out\\nof this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;\\nsend keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a\\nstrait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go\\nout of this. You don\\'t know what you do by keeping me here. I am\\nspeaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don\\'t know\\nwhom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.\\nBy all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is\\nlost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out\\nof this and save my soul from guilt! Can\\'t you hear me, man? Can\\'t you\\nunderstand? Will you never learn? Don\\'t you know that I am sane and\\nearnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting\\nfor his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!\"\\n\\n\\nI thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so\\nwould bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.\\n\\n\\n\"Come,\" I said sternly, \"no more of this; we have had quite enough\\nalready. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.\"\\n\\n\\nHe suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,\\nwithout a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the\\nbed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had\\nexpected.\\n\\n\\nWhen I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a\\nquiet, well-bred voice:--\\n\\n\\n\"You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later\\non, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy\\nmind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am\\nso glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.\\nSomehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at\\nall; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and\\nbrains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way\\nthat every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and\\nthat she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a\\nlittle upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his\\nroom we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said\\nto Dr. Seward:--\\n\\n\\n\"Say, Jack, if that man wasn\\'t attempting a bluff, he is about the\\nsanest lunatic I ever saw. I\\'m not sure, but I believe that he had some\\nserious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a\\nchance.\" Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--\\n\\n\\n\"Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I\\'m glad of it,\\nfor I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last\\nhysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in\\nour present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.\\nAll is best as they are.\" Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a\\ndreamy kind of way:--\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an\\nordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he\\nseems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am\\nafraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can\\'t forget how\\nhe prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my\\nthroat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count \\'lord and\\nmaster,\\' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.\\nThat horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help\\nhim, so I suppose he isn\\'t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He\\ncertainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is\\nbest. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,\\nhelp to unnerve a man.\" The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand\\non his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--\\n\\n\\n\"Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad\\nand terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to\\nhope for, except the pity of the good God?\" Lord Godalming had slipped\\naway for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver\\nwhistle, as he remarked:--\\n\\n\\n\"That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I\\'ve got an antidote on\\ncall.\" Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care\\nto keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone\\nout. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out\\na lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four\\nlittle groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of\\nmany kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the\\nstrength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are\\nof the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not\\namenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong\\nin all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him\\nas we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his\\ntouch. Keep this near your heart\"--as he spoke he lifted a little silver\\ncrucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--\"put these\\nflowers round your neck\"--here he handed to me a wreath of withered\\ngarlic blossoms--\"for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this\\nknife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can\\nfasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,\\nwhich we must not desecrate needless.\" This was a portion of Sacred\\nWafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others\\nwas similarly equipped. \"Now,\" he said, \"friend John, where are the\\nskeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house\\nby the window, as before at Miss Lucy\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\nDr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a\\nsurgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after\\na little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty\\nclang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and\\nit slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in\\nDr. Seward\\'s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra\\'s tomb; I fancy that\\nthe same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they\\nshrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped\\ninto the open door.\\n\\n\\n\"_In manus tuas, Domine!_\" he said, crossing himself as he passed over\\nthe threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have\\nlit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The\\nProfessor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it\\nfrom within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our\\nlamps and proceeded on our search.\\n\\n\\nThe light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the\\nrays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great\\nshadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there\\nwas some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so\\npowerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible\\nexperience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,\\nfor I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every\\nsound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.\\n\\n\\nThe whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches\\ndeep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down\\nmy lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The\\nwalls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of\\nspider\\'s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old\\ntattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the\\nhall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They\\nhad been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents\\nin the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor\\nlifted them. He turned to me and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know\\nit at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?\" I had an\\nidea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to\\nget admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings\\nfound myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.\\n\"This is the spot,\" said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small\\nmap of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence\\nregarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the\\nbunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for\\nas we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale\\nthrough the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we\\nencountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close\\nquarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of\\nhis existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in\\na ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and\\nclose, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was\\nan earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler\\nair. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not\\nalone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the\\npungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had\\nbecome itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath\\nexhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and\\nintensified its loathsomeness.\\n\\n\\nUnder ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our\\nenterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and\\nterrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose\\nabove merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking\\nconsequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our\\nwork as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.\\n\\n\\nWe made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we\\nbegan:--\\n\\n\\n\"The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then\\nexamine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some\\nclue as to what has become of the rest.\" A glance was sufficient to show\\nhow many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was\\nno mistaking them.\\n\\n\\nThere were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,\\nfor, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted\\ndoor into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my\\nheart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to\\nsee the high lights of the Count\\'s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the\\nred eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,\\nas Lord Godalming said, \"I thought I saw a face, but it was only the\\nshadows,\" and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,\\nand stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there\\nwere no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid\\nwalls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I\\ntook it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.\\n\\n\\nA few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which\\nhe was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for\\nundoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass\\nof phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew\\nback. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.\\n\\n\\nFor a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was\\nseemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great\\niron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,\\nand which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the\\nhuge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver\\nwhistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered\\nfrom behind Dr. Seward\\'s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a\\nminute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.\\nUnconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I\\nnoticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been\\ntaken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had\\nelapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to\\nswarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their\\nmoving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look\\nlike a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the\\nthreshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting\\ntheir noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were\\nmultiplying in thousands, and we moved out.\\n\\n\\nLord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him\\non the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to\\nrecover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before\\nhim so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other\\ndogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey\\nere the whole mass had vanished.\\n\\n\\nWith their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for\\nthe dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at\\ntheir prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in\\nthe air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.\\nWhether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of\\nthe chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves\\nin the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to\\nslip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something\\nof its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our\\nresolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and\\nbringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found\\nnothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all\\nuntouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.\\nNever once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when\\nwe returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been\\nrabbit-hunting in a summer wood.\\n\\n\\nThe morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.\\nDr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and\\nlocked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket\\nwhen he had done.\\n\\n\\n\"So far,\" he said, \"our night has been eminently successful. No harm has\\ncome to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how\\nmany boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our\\nfirst--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been\\naccomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or\\ntroubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and\\nsmells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have\\nlearned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute\\nbeasts which are to the Count\\'s command are yet themselves not amenable\\nto his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his\\ncall, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and\\nto that poor mother\\'s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell\\nfrom the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters\\nbefore us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used\\nhis power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.\\nSo be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity\\nto cry \\'check\\' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the\\nstake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,\\nand we have reason to be content with our first night\\'s work. It may be\\nordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;\\nbut we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.\"\\n\\n\\nThe house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who\\nwas screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound\\nfrom Renfield\\'s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,\\nafter the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.\\n\\n\\nI came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so\\nsoftly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than\\nusual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly\\nthankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our\\ndeliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not\\nthink so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is\\nsettled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet\\nto conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she\\nsuspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a\\nsealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all\\nis finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I\\ndaresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such\\nconfidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep\\ndark over to-night\\'s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that\\nhas happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all\\noverslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no\\nrest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept\\ntill the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or\\nthree times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a\\nfew seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of\\nblank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She\\ncomplained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the\\nday. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be\\nthat several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace\\nthem all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the\\nsooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas\\nSnelling to-day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor\\nwalking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it\\nis quite evident that last night\\'s work has helped to take some of the\\nbrooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the\\nnight he suddenly said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him\\nthis morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may\\nbe. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,\\nand reason so sound.\" I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him\\nthat if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to\\nkeep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary\\ninstructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against\\ngetting any false impression from my patient. \"But,\" he answered, \"I\\nwant him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live\\nthings. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that\\nhe had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" I said, \"but the answer is here.\" I laid my hand on the\\ntype-written matter. \"When our sane and learned lunatic made that very\\nstatement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually\\nnauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.\\nHarker entered the room.\" Van Helsing smiled in turn. \"Good!\" he said.\\n\"Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it\\nis this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease\\nsuch a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the\\nfolly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.\\nWho knows?\" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in\\nhand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was\\nVan Helsing back in the study. \"Do I interrupt?\" he asked politely as he\\nstood at the door.\\n\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" I answered. \"Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.\\nI can go with you now, if you like.\\n\\n\\n\"It is needless; I have seen him!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.\\nWhen I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with\\nhis elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen\\ndiscontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a\\nmeasure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. \"Don\\'t\\nyou know me?\" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: \"I know you well\\nenough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself\\nand your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed\\nDutchmen!\" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable\\nsullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at\\nall. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so\\nclever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few\\nhappy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does\\nrejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be\\nworried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it\\nis better so.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I agree with you with all my heart,\" I answered earnestly, for I did\\nnot want him to weaken in this matter. \"Mrs. Harker is better out of it.\\nThings are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have\\nbeen in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,\\nand if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time\\ninfallibly have wrecked her.\"\\n\\n\\nSo Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey\\nand Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I\\nshall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;\\nafter Jonathan\\'s full confidence for so many years, to see him\\nmanifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This\\nmorning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though\\nJonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went\\nout, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of\\nwhat had happened in the visit to the Count\\'s house. And yet he must\\nhave known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it\\nmust have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that\\nit was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and\\nI acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am\\ncrying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband\\'s great\\nlove and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.\\n\\n\\nThat has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and\\nlest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept\\nanything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has\\nfeared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my\\nheart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and\\nlow-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible\\nexcitement.\\n\\n\\nLast night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told\\nme to. I didn\\'t feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I\\nkept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to\\nsee me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate\\npressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does\\nseems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which\\nis most to be deplored. If I hadn\\'t gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear\\nLucy would be with us now. She hadn\\'t taken to visiting the churchyard\\ntill I came, and if she hadn\\'t come there in the day-time with me she\\nwouldn\\'t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn\\'t gone there at\\nnight and asleep, that monster couldn\\'t have destroyed her as he did.\\nOh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what\\nhas come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew\\nthat I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my\\nown account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear\\nfellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do\\nfeel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons\\nthat we poor women have to learn....\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing\\nthe sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying\\non a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield\\'s room, which is somewhere\\nunder this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so\\nprofound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.\\nAll was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight\\nseeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be\\nstirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin\\nstreak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness\\nacross the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a\\nvitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must\\nhave done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy\\ncreeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out\\nand looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now\\nclose up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the\\nwall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was\\nmore loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,\\nI could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on\\nhis part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the\\nattendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into\\nbed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.\\nI was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have\\nfallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the\\nmorning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a\\nlittle time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was\\nbending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of\\nthe way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.\\n\\n\\nI thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I\\nwas very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my\\nhands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the\\nusual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn\\nupon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the\\nclothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim\\naround. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,\\ncame only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently\\ngrown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I\\nhad shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to\\nmake certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my\\nlimbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed\\nmy eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what\\ntricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The\\nmist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I\\ncould see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling\\nwater--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of\\nthe door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became\\nconcentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top\\nof which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things\\nbegan to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now\\nwhirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words \"a\\npillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.\" Was it indeed some such\\nspiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was\\ncomposed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the\\nred eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I\\nlooked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like\\ntwo red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering\\nwhen, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary\\'s\\nChurch. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan\\nhad seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist\\nin the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became\\nblack darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to\\nshow me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be\\ncareful of such dreams, for they would unseat one\\'s reason if there were\\ntoo much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe\\nsomething for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm\\nthem. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their\\nfears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do\\nnot, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that\\ncannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night\\'s sleep. Last\\nnight tired me more than if I had not slept at all.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have\\nslept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the\\nsleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and\\nspiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.\\nIn the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was\\nvery gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless\\nme. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This\\nis a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be\\nmiserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till\\ndinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten\\nthem up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how\\ntired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke\\ntogether, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other\\nof what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan\\'s\\nmanner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so\\nsleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to\\ngive me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night\\nbefore. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to\\nme, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I\\nhave taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope\\nI have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear\\ncomes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the\\npower of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal\\nGreen, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The\\nvery prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had\\nproved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I\\nlearned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he\\nwas only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the\\nresponsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph\\nSmollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a\\nsaucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable\\ntype of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all\\nabout the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog\\'s-eared\\nnotebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the\\nseat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,\\nhalf-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There\\nwere, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at\\n197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he\\ndeposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to\\nscatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were\\nchosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more\\nfully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that\\nhe could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now\\nfixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern\\nshore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to\\nbe left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the\\nvery heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back\\nto Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had\\nbeen taken from Carfax.\\n\\n\\nHe replied:--\\n\\n\\n\"Well, guv\\'nor, you\\'ve treated me wery \\'an\\'some\"--I had given him half a\\nsovereign--\"an\\' I\\'ll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of\\nBloxam say four nights ago in the \\'Are an\\' \\'Ounds, in Pincher\\'s Alley,\\nas \\'ow he an\\' his mate \\'ad \\'ad a rare dusty job in a old \\'ouse at\\nPurfect. There ain\\'t a-many such jobs as this \\'ere, an\\' I\\'m thinkin\\'\\nthat maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.\" I asked if he could tell me\\nwhere to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it\\nwould be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest\\nof his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search\\nthen and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Look \\'ere, guv\\'nor, there ain\\'t no sense in me a-keepin\\' you \\'ere. I\\nmay find Sam soon, or I mayn\\'t; but anyhow he ain\\'t like to be in a way\\nto tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.\\nIf you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on\\nit, I\\'ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But\\nye\\'d better be up arter \\'im soon in the mornin\\', or maybe ye won\\'t ketch\\n\\'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.\"\\n\\n\\nThis was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to\\nbuy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she\\ncame back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had\\nagain faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way\\nto home. We\\'re on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.\\nMina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as\\nthough she had been crying. Poor dear, I\\'ve no doubt it frets her to be\\nkept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the\\nothers. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and\\nworried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors\\nwere quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful\\nbusiness. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence\\nmust rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any\\ncircumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she\\nherself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the\\nCount or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first\\npost I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on\\nwhich was written with a carpenter\\'s pencil in a sprawling hand:--\\n\\n\\n\"Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for\\nthe depite.\"\\n\\n\\nI got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy\\nand sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,\\nbut that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for\\nher going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,\\nwith her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and\\nin ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I\\nwas off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should\\nhave found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some\\ndifficulty, Potter\\'s Court. Mr. Smollet\\'s spelling misled me, as I asked\\nfor Poter\\'s Court instead of Potter\\'s Court. However, when I had found\\nthe court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran\\'s lodging-house.\\nWhen I asked the man who came to the door for the \"depite,\" he shook his\\nhead, and said: \"I dunno \\'im. There ain\\'t no such a person \\'ere; I never\\n\\'eard of \\'im in all my bloomin\\' days. Don\\'t believe there ain\\'t nobody\\nof that kind livin\\' ere or anywheres.\" I took out Smollet\\'s letter, and\\nas I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name\\nof the court might guide me. \"What are you?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m the depity,\" he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right\\ntrack; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the\\ndeputy\\'s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who\\nhad slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at\\nCorcoran\\'s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o\\'clock that\\nmorning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but\\nhe had a vague idea that it was some kind of a \"new-fangled ware\\'us\";\\nand with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve\\no\\'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this\\nI got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One\\nof these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a\\nnew \"cold storage\" building; and as this suited the condition of a\\n\"new-fangled ware\\'us,\" I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly\\ngatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the\\ncoin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my\\nsuggesting that I was willing to pay his day\\'s wages to his foreman for\\nthe privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was\\na smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had\\npromised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me\\nthat he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,\\nand had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--\"main\\nheavy ones\"--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I\\nasked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to\\nwhich he replied:--\\n\\n\\n\"Well, guv\\'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a\\nbig white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a\\ndusty old \\'ouse, too, though nothin\\' to the dustiness of the \\'ouse we\\ntooked the bloomin\\' boxes from.\"\\n\\n\\n\"How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?\"\\n\\n\\n\"There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin\\' in the \\'ouse at\\nPurfleet. He \\'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse\\nme, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an\\' him a old feller,\\nwith a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn\\'t throw\\na shadder.\"\\n\\n\\nHow this phrase thrilled through me!\\n\\n\\n\"Why, \\'e took up \\'is end o\\' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and\\nme a-puffin\\' an\\' a-blowin\\' afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an\\' I\\'m no\\nchicken, neither.\"\\n\\n\\n\"How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n\"He was there too. He must \\'a\\' started off and got there afore me, for\\nwhen I rung of the bell he kem an\\' opened the door \\'isself an\\' \\'elped me\\nto carry the boxes into the \\'all.\"\\n\\n\\n\"The whole nine?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n\"Yus; there was five in the first load an\\' four in the second. It was\\nmain dry work, an\\' I don\\'t so well remember \\'ow I got \\'ome.\" I\\ninterrupted him:--\\n\\n\\n\"Were the boxes left in the hall?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yus; it was a big \\'all, an\\' there was nothin\\' else in it.\" I made one\\nmore attempt to further matters:--\\n\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t have any key?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door \\'isself\\nan\\' shut it again when I druv off. I don\\'t remember the last time--but\\nthat was the beer.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And you can\\'t remember the number of the house?\"\\n\\n\\n\"No, sir. But ye needn\\'t have no difficulty about that. It\\'s a \\'igh \\'un\\nwith a stone front with a bow on it, an\\' \\'igh steps up to the door. I\\nknow them steps, \\'avin\\' \\'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers\\nwhat come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin\\'s, an\\'\\nthey seein\\' they got so much, they wanted more; but \\'e took one of them\\nby the shoulder and was like to throw \\'im down the steps, till the lot\\nof them went away cussin\\'.\" I thought that with this description I could\\nfind the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started\\noff for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count\\ncould, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was\\nprecious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of\\ndistribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task\\nunobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked\\nwestward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house\\ndescribed, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs\\narranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long\\nuntenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were\\nup. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint\\nhad mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been\\na large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been\\nroughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.\\nBehind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,\\nwhose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have\\nbeen able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have\\ngiven some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my\\nexperience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not\\nbut feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means\\ndiscovered of gaining access to the house.\\n\\n\\nThere was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and\\nnothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything\\ncould be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the\\nPiccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the\\ngrooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything\\nabout the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been\\ntaken, but he couldn\\'t say from whom. He told me, however, that up to\\nvery lately there had been a notice-board of \"For Sale\" up, and that\\nperhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me\\nsomething, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on\\nthe board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know\\nor guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled\\naway. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I\\ndid not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &\\nCandy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in\\nSackville Street.\\n\\n\\nThe gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but\\nuncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the\\nPiccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a\\n\"mansion\"--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I\\nasked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and\\npaused a few seconds before replying:--\\n\\n\\n\"It is sold, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Pardon me,\" I said, with equal politeness, \"but I have a special reason\\nfor wishing to know who purchased it.\"\\n\\n\\nAgain he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. \"It is sold,\\nsir,\" was again his laconic reply.\\n\\n\\n\"Surely,\" I said, \"you do not mind letting me know so much.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But I do mind,\" he answered. \"The affairs of their clients are\\nabsolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.\" This was\\nmanifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with\\nhim. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their\\nconfidence. I am myself a professional man.\" Here I handed him my card.\\n\"In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of\\nLord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,\\nhe understood, lately for sale.\" These words put a different complexion\\non affairs. He said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would\\nI like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of\\nrenting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur\\nHolmwood. If you will let me have his lordship\\'s address I will consult\\nthe House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his\\nlordship by to-night\\'s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far\\ndeviate from our rules as to give the required information to his\\nlordship.\"\\n\\n\\nI wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,\\ngave the address at Dr. Seward\\'s and came away. It was now dark, and I\\nwas tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company\\nand came down to Purfleet by the next train.\\n\\n\\nI found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she\\nmade a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to\\nthink that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her\\ninquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at\\nour conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our\\nconfidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of\\nkeeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or\\nelse the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when\\nany accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we\\nmade our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing\\nknowledge would be torture to her.\\n\\n\\nI could not tell the others of the day\\'s discovery till we were alone;\\nso after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even\\namongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.\\nThe dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me\\nas though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I\\ncame away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no\\ndifference between us.\\n\\n\\nWhen I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in\\nthe study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read\\nit off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own\\ninformation; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n\\n\"This has been a great day\\'s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on\\nthe track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then\\nour work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search\\nuntil we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the\\nwretch to his real death.\" We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.\\nMorris spoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"Say! how are we going to get into that house?\"\\n\\n\\n\"We got into the other,\" answered Lord Godalming quickly.\\n\\n\\n\"But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night\\nand a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to\\ncommit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don\\'t\\nsee how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key\\nof some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the\\nmorning.\" Lord Godalming\\'s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked\\nabout the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to\\nanother of us:--\\n\\n\\n\"Quincey\\'s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we\\ngot off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we\\ncan find the Count\\'s key basket.\"\\n\\n\\nAs nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at\\nleast advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell\\'s,\\nwe decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good\\nwhile we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and\\nbearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the\\nmoment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....\\n\\n\\nJust a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her\\nforehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even\\nin her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she\\ndid this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be\\nherself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so\\nrapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they\\nalways mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more\\nthan interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his\\nrepulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.\\nHe was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really\\ncare for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and\\nlooked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I\\nthought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked\\nhim:--\\n\\n\\n\"What about the flies these times?\" He smiled on me in quite a superior\\nsort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as\\nhe answered me:--\\n\\n\\n\"The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical\\nof the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well\\nwhen they typified the soul as a butterfly!\"\\n\\n\\nI thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said\\nquickly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?\" His madness foiled his\\nreason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head\\nwith a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.\" Here he brightened\\nup; \"I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I\\nhave all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to\\nstudy zoöphagy!\"\\n\\n\\nThis puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--\\n\\n\\n\"Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?\" He smiled with an\\nineffably benign superiority.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the\\nDeity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I\\nmay state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things\\npurely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied\\nspiritually!\" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall\\nEnoch\\'s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt\\nthat by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--\\n\\n\\n\"And why with Enoch?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Because he walked with God.\" I could not see the analogy, but did not\\nlike to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--\\n\\n\\n\"So you don\\'t care about life and you don\\'t want souls. Why not?\" I put\\nmy question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.\\nThe effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his\\nold servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as\\nhe replied:--\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don\\'t. I couldn\\'t use them if\\nI had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn\\'t eat them\\nor----\" He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his\\nface, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. \"And doctor, as to\\nlife, what is it after all? When you\\'ve got all you require, and you\\nknow that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good\\nfriends--like you, Dr. Seward\"; this was said with a leer of\\ninexpressible cunning. \"I know that I shall never lack the means of\\nlife!\"\\n\\n\\nI think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some\\nantagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as\\nhe--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it\\nwas useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.\\n\\n\\nLater in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come\\nwithout special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him\\nthat I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything\\nto help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are\\nLord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the\\nrecord prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate\\nknowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish\\nto be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with\\nme to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he\\nmight not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield\\nmight not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were\\nalone.\\n\\n\\nI found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose\\nwhich is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I\\ncame in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his\\nlips:--\\n\\n\\n\"What about souls?\" It was evident then that my surmise had been\\ncorrect. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the\\nlunatic. I determined to have the matter out. \"What about them\\nyourself?\" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round\\nhim, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for\\nan answer.\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want any souls!\" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The\\nmatter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to \"be\\ncruel only to be kind.\" So I said:--\\n\\n\\n\"You like life, and you want life?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn\\'t worry about that!\"\\n\\n\\n\"But,\" I asked, \"how are we to get the life without getting the soul\\nalso?\" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--\\n\\n\\n\"A nice time you\\'ll have some time when you\\'re flying out there, with\\nthe souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing\\nand twittering and miauing all round you. You\\'ve got their lives, you\\nknow, and you must put up with their souls!\" Something seemed to affect\\nhis imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,\\nscrewing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being\\nsoaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave\\nme a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,\\nthough the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It\\nwas evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,\\nand, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign\\nto himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and\\ngo with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,\\nspeaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--\\n\\n\\n\"Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?\" He seemed to\\nwake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--\\n\\n\\n\"Not much! flies are poor things, after all!\" After a pause he added,\\n\"But I don\\'t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Or spiders?\" I went on.\\n\\n\\n\"Blow spiders! What\\'s the use of spiders? There isn\\'t anything in them\\nto eat or\"--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden\\ntopic.\\n\\n\\n\"So, so!\" I thought to myself, \"this is the second time he has suddenly\\nstopped at the word \\'drink\\'; what does it mean?\" Renfield seemed himself\\naware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract\\nmy attention from it:--\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t take any stock at all in such matters. \\'Rats and mice and such\\nsmall deer,\\' as Shakespeare has it, \\'chicken-feed of the larder\\' they\\nmight be called. I\\'m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well\\nask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to\\ninterest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before\\nme.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I see,\" I said. \"You want big things that you can make your teeth meet\\nin? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?\"\\n\\n\\n\"What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!\" He was getting too wide\\nawake, so I thought I would press him hard. \"I wonder,\" I said\\nreflectively, \"what an elephant\\'s soul is like!\"\\n\\n\\nThe effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his\\nhigh-horse and became a child again.\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want an elephant\\'s soul, or any soul at all!\" he said. For a\\nfew moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with\\nhis eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. \"To\\nhell with you and your souls!\" he shouted. \"Why do you plague me about\\nsouls? Haven\\'t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,\\nwithout thinking of souls!\" He looked so hostile that I thought he was\\nin for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,\\nhowever, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--\\n\\n\\n\"Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so\\nworried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the\\nproblem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and\\ntolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I\\nwant to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am\\nsure you will understand!\" He had evidently self-control; so when the\\nattendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield\\nwatched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable\\ndignity and sweetness:--\\n\\n\\n\"Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that\\nI am very, very grateful to you!\" I thought it well to leave him in this\\nmood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in\\nthis man\\'s state. Several points seem to make what the American\\ninterviewer calls \"a story,\" if one could only get them in proper order.\\nHere they are:--\\n\\n\\nWill not mention \"drinking.\"\\n\\n\\nFears the thought of being burdened with the \"soul\" of anything.\\n\\n\\nHas no dread of wanting \"life\" in the future.\\n\\n\\nDespises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being\\nhaunted by their souls.\\n\\n\\nLogically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind\\nthat he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--the\\nburden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!\\n\\n\\nAnd the assurance--?\\n\\n\\nMerciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of\\nterror afoot!\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my\\nsuspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a\\nwhile asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door\\nwe heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time\\nwhich now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that\\nhe had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the\\nautumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk\\nof the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He\\nwent on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had\\ngot a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come\\naway as ignorant as we went in.\\n\\n\\nHis is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming._\\n\\n\\n_\"1 October._\\n\\n\\n\"My Lord,\\n\\n\\n\"We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with\\nregard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your\\nbehalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and\\npurchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors\\nof the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign\\nnobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the\\npurchase money in notes \\'over the counter,\\' if your Lordship will pardon\\nus using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever\\nof him.\\n\\n\\n\"We are, my Lord,\\n\\n\\n\"Your Lordship\\'s humble servants,\\n\\n\\n\"MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_2 October._--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to\\nmake an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield\\'s room,\\nand gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he\\nwas to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire\\nin the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts\\nand discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,\\nand we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.\\n\\n\\nBefore going to bed I went round to the patient\\'s room and looked in\\nthrough the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart\\nrose and fell with regular respiration.\\n\\n\\nThis morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight\\nhe was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him\\nif that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was\\nsomething about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if\\nhe had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having \"dozed\" for\\na while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are\\nwatched.\\n\\n\\nTo-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are\\nlooking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have\\nhorses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we\\nseek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported\\nearth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his\\nweakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the\\nBritish Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old\\nphysicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,\\nand the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be\\nuseful to us later.\\n\\n\\nI sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in\\nstrait-waistcoats.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our\\nwork of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder if\\nRenfield\\'s quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so\\nfollowed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the\\nmonster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only get\\nsome hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument\\nwith him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a\\nvaluable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?---- That\\nwild yell seemed to come from his room....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nThe attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had\\nsomehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he went\\nto him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.\\nI must go at once....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\n\\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well\\nas I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I\\ncan recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.\\n\\n\\nWhen I came to Renfield\\'s room I found him lying on the floor on his\\nleft side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it\\nbecame at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;\\nthere seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body\\nwhich marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see\\nthat it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the\\nfloor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood\\noriginated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as\\nwe turned him over:--\\n\\n\\n\"I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and\\nthe whole side of his face are paralysed.\" How such a thing could have\\nhappened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite\\nbewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I can\\'t understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by\\nbeating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the\\nEversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he\\nmight have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward\\nkink. But for the life of me I can\\'t imagine how the two things\\noccurred. If his back was broke, he couldn\\'t beat his head; and if his\\nface was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of\\nit.\" I said to him:--\\n\\n\\n\"Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want\\nhim without an instant\\'s delay.\" The man ran off, and within a few\\nminutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When\\nhe saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and\\nthen turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he\\nsaid very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much\\nattention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.\\nIf you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.\"\\n\\n\\nThe patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that\\nhe had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with\\nextraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had\\nevidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he\\nlooked at the patient, he whispered to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes\\nconscious, after the operation.\" So I said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at\\npresent. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.\\nLet me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.\"\\n\\n\\nThe man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.\\nThe wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed\\nfracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The\\nProfessor thought a moment and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far\\nas can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of\\nhis injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the\\nbrain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be\\ntoo late.\" As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I\\nwent over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and\\nQuincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.\\nSo I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things\\nare moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us\\nthese times. I\\'ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things\\nas they have been. We\\'ll have to look back--and forward a little more\\nthan we have done. May we come in?\" I nodded, and held the door open\\ntill they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the\\nattitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the\\nfloor, he said softly:--\\n\\n\\n\"My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!\" I told him\\nbriefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after\\nthe operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat\\ndown on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched\\nin patience.\\n\\n\\n\"We shall wait,\" said Van Helsing, \"just long enough to fix the best\\nspot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove\\nthe blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing.\"\\n\\n\\nThe minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a\\nhorrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing\\'s face I gathered\\nthat he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded\\nthe words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;\\nbut the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men\\nwho have heard the death-watch. The poor man\\'s breathing came in\\nuncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes\\nand speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he\\nwould relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick\\nbeds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost\\nhear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my\\ntemples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became\\nagonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from\\ntheir flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal\\ntorture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead\\nsome dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect\\nit.\\n\\n\\nAt last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was\\nsinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor\\nand caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he\\nspoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have\\nbeen thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!\\nWe shall operate just above the ear.\"\\n\\n\\nWithout another word he made the operation. For a few moments the\\nbreathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so\\nprolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.\\nSuddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.\\nThis was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad\\nsurprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved\\nconvulsively, and as he did so, said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I\\nhave had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot\\nmove. What\\'s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts\\ndreadfully.\" He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his\\neyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van\\nHelsing said in a quiet grave tone:--\\n\\n\\n\"Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.\" As he heard the voice his face\\nbrightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some\\nwater, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed\"--he\\nstopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--\"The\\nbrandy--it is in my study--quick!\" He flew and returned with a glass,\\nthe decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched\\nlips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor\\ninjured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite\\nconscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I\\nshall never forget, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.\"\\nThen his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two\\nfigures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"If I were not sure already, I would know from them.\" For an instant his\\neyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were\\nbringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,\\nhurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--\\n\\n\\n\"Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;\\nand then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy\\nagain. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor\\ncrushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left\\nme, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn\\'t speak then, for I\\nfelt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as\\nI am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left\\nme; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain\\nseemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the\\ndogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!\" As he spoke, Van\\nHelsing\\'s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and\\ngripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly\\nand said: \"Go on,\" in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--\\n\\n\\n\"He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;\\nbut he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a\\nman\\'s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white\\nteeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt\\nof trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn\\'t ask him to come in\\nat first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.\\nThen he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.\" He\\nwas interrupted by a word from the Professor:--\\n\\n\\n\"How?\"\\n\\n\\n\"By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the\\nsun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their\\nwings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their\\nbacks.\" Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--\\n\\n\\n\"The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the\\n\\'Death\\'s-head Moth\\'?\" The patient went on without stopping.\\n\\n\\n\"Then he began to whisper: \\'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,\\nmillions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats\\ntoo. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely\\nbuzzing flies!\\' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.\\nThen the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He\\nbeckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his\\nhands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass\\nspread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and\\nthen He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there\\nwere thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only\\nsmaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he\\nseemed to be saying: \\'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more\\nand greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship\\nme!\\' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close\\nover my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening\\nthe sash and saying to Him: \\'Come in, Lord and Master!\\' The rats were\\nall gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only\\nopen an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through\\nthe tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and\\nsplendour.\"\\n\\n\\nHis voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and\\nhe continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in\\nthe interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him\\nback to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: \"Let him go on. Do\\nnot interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all\\nif once he lost the thread of his thought.\" He proceeded:--\\n\\n\\n\"All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not\\neven a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.\\nWhen he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even\\nknock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked\\nout of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he\\nowned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn\\'t even smell the same\\nas he went by me. I couldn\\'t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.\\nHarker had come into the room.\"\\n\\n\\nThe two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind\\nhim so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.\\nThey were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,\\nhowever, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without\\nnoticing:--\\n\\n\\n\"When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn\\'t the same;\\nit was like tea after the teapot had been watered.\" Here we all moved,\\nbut no one said a word; he went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn\\'t look the\\nsame. I don\\'t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood\\nin them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn\\'t think of it\\nat the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad\\nto know that He had been taking the life out of her.\" I could feel that\\nthe rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. \"So when\\nHe came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I\\ngrabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and\\nas I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.\\nAy, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle\\nwith me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn\\'t\\nmean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned\\ninto me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and\\nwhen I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There\\nwas a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed\\nto steal away under the door.\" His voice was becoming fainter and his\\nbreath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.\\n\\n\\n\"We know the worst now,\" he said. \"He is here, and we know his purpose.\\nIt may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other\\nnight, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.\" There was no\\nneed to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in\\ncommon. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we\\nhad when we entered the Count\\'s house. The Professor had his ready, and\\nas we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is\\nover. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.\\nAlas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!\" He stopped; his\\nvoice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in\\nmy own heart.\\n\\n\\nOutside the Harkers\\' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the\\nlatter said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Should we disturb her?\"\\n\\n\\n\"We must,\" said Van Helsing grimly. \"If the door be locked, I shall\\nbreak it in.\"\\n\\n\\n\"May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady\\'s\\nroom!\"\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing said solemnly, \"You are always right; but this is life and\\ndeath. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they\\nare all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if\\nthe door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you\\ntoo, my friends. Now!\"\\n\\n\\nHe turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw\\nourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell\\nheadlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw\\nacross him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw\\nappalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,\\nand my heart seemed to stand still.\\n\\n\\nThe moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room\\nwas light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan\\nHarker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.\\nKneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad\\nfigure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.\\nHis face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised\\nthe Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left\\nhand he held both Mrs. Harker\\'s hands, keeping them away with her arms\\nat full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,\\nforcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared\\nwith blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man\\'s bare breast which\\nwas shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible\\nresemblance to a child forcing a kitten\\'s nose into a saucer of milk to\\ncompel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his\\nface, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap\\ninto it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils\\nof the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the\\nwhite sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,\\nchamped together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw\\nhis victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned\\nand sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,\\nand was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred\\nWafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside\\nthe tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,\\nlifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a\\ngreat black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up\\nunder Quincey\\'s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we\\nlooked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting\\nopen, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved\\nforward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with\\nit had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it\\nseems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a\\nfew seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was\\nghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared\\nher lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of\\nblood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her\\npoor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the\\nCount\\'s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail\\nwhich made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an\\nendless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently\\nover her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant\\ndespairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can\\ndo nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers\\nherself; I must wake him!\" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water\\nand with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while\\nholding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was\\nheart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the\\nwindow. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey\\nMorris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great\\nyew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the\\ninstant I heard Harker\\'s quick exclamation as he woke to partial\\nconsciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well\\nbe, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and\\nthen full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he\\nstarted up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to\\nhim with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,\\nhowever, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held\\nher hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.\\n\\n\\n\"In God\\'s name what does this mean?\" Harker cried out. \"Dr. Seward, Dr.\\nVan Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,\\nwhat is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to\\nthis!\" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly\\ntogether. \"Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!\" With a quick\\nmovement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the\\nman in him awake at the need for instant exertion. \"What has happened?\\nTell me all about it!\" he cried without pausing. \"Dr. Van Helsing, you\\nlove Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too\\nfar yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!\" His wife, through her terror\\nand horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly\\nforgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--\\n\\n\\n\"No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough\\nto-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay\\nwith me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!\" Her\\nexpression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she\\npulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his\\nlittle golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--\\n\\n\\n\"Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no\\nfoul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm\\nand take counsel together.\" She shuddered and was silent, holding down\\nher head on her husband\\'s breast. When she raised it, his white\\nnight-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where\\nthe thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she\\nsaw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking\\nsobs:--\\n\\n\\n\"Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it\\nshould be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have\\nmost cause to fear.\" To this he spoke out resolutely:--\\n\\n\\n\"Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not\\nhear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my\\ndeserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,\\nif by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!\" He put out\\nhis arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there\\nsobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked\\ndamply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a\\nwhile her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to\\nme, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous\\npower to the utmost:--\\n\\n\\n\"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad\\nfact; tell me all that has been.\" I told him exactly what had happened,\\nand he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched\\nand his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had\\nheld his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to\\nthe open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to\\nsee, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over\\nthe bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled\\nhair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.\\nThey entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me\\nquestioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of\\ntheir coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband\\nand wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence\\nto him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming\\nanswered:--\\n\\n\\n\"I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I\\nlooked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,\\nhowever----\" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on\\nthe bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--\\n\\n\\n\"Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now\\nis in knowing all. Tell freely!\" So Art went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few\\nseconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been\\nburned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the\\ncylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax\\nhad helped the flames.\" Here I interrupted. \"Thank God there is the\\nother copy in the safe!\" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he\\nwent on: \"I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked\\ninto Renfield\\'s room; but there was no trace there except----!\" Again he\\npaused. \"Go on,\" said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and\\nmoistening his lips with his tongue, added: \"except that the poor fellow\\nis dead.\" Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of\\nus she said solemnly:--\\n\\n\\n\"God\\'s will be done!\" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back\\nsomething; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.\\nVan Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--\\n\\n\\n\"And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?\"\\n\\n\\n\"A little,\" he answered. \"It may be much eventually, but at present I\\ncan\\'t say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would\\ngo when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from\\nRenfield\\'s window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some\\nshape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He\\nwill not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the\\ndawn is close. We must work to-morrow!\"\\n\\n\\nHe said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps\\na couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could\\nhear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his\\nhand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker\\'s head:--\\n\\n\\n\"And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what\\nhappened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is\\nneed that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done\\nquick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must\\nend all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and\\nlearn.\"\\n\\n\\nThe poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves\\nas she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and\\nlower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held\\nout one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and\\nkissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that\\nof her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.\\nAfter a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she\\nbegan:--\\n\\n\\n\"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a\\nlong time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads\\nof horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them\\nconnected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.\"\\nHer husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said\\nlovingly: \"Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me\\nthrough the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me\\nto tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I\\nneed your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work\\nwith my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to\\nsleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no\\nmore. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when\\nnext I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I\\nhad before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find\\nit in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague\\nterror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.\\nI turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it\\nseemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I\\ntried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I\\nlooked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside\\nthe bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist\\nhad turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a\\ntall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of\\nthe others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light\\nfell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white\\nteeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the\\nsunset on the windows of St. Mary\\'s Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the\\nred scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant\\nmy heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was\\nparalysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,\\npointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out\\nbefore your very eyes.\\' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or\\nsay anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder\\nand, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did\\nso, \\'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well\\nbe quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have\\nappeased my thirst!\\' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not\\nwant to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that\\nsuch is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity\\nme! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!\" Her husband groaned\\nagain. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if\\nhe were the injured one, and went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long\\nthis horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time\\nmust have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I\\nsaw it drip with the fresh blood!\" The remembrance seemed for a while to\\noverpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her\\nhusband\\'s sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and\\nwent on:--\\n\\n\\n\"Then he spoke to me mockingly, \\'And so you, like the others, would play\\nyour brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and\\nfrustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,\\nand will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They\\nshould have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they\\nplayed wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued\\nfor them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were\\nborn--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now\\nto me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful\\nwine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my\\nhelper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall\\nminister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you\\nhave done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my\\ncall. When my brain says \"Come!\" to you, you shall cross land or sea to\\ndo my bidding; and to that end this!\\' With that he pulled open his\\nshirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When\\nthe blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding\\nthem tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to\\nthe wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh\\nmy God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a\\nfate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my\\ndays. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;\\nand in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!\" Then she began to rub her\\nlips as though to cleanse them from pollution.\\n\\n\\nAs she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,\\nand everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;\\nbut over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look\\nwhich deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first\\nred streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out\\nagainst the whitening hair.\\n\\n\\nWe have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy\\npair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.\\n\\n\\nOf this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in\\nall the great round of its daily course.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\n\\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It\\nis now six o\\'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and\\ntake something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed\\nthat if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God\\nknows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare\\nnot stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end\\nthe little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could\\nnot have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,\\nwe must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears\\nrunning down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our\\nfaith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us\\nup to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!\\n\\n\\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor\\nRenfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward\\ntold us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below\\nthey had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was\\nall bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.\\n\\n\\nDr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had\\nheard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to\\nhalf dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield\\nhad called out loudly several times, \"God! God! God!\" after that there\\nwas a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying\\non the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing\\nasked if he had heard \"voices\" or \"a voice,\" and he said he could not\\nsay; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as\\nthere was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear\\nto it, if required, that the word \"God\" was spoken by the patient. Dr.\\nSeward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into\\nthe matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it\\nwould never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As\\nit was, he thought that on the attendant\\'s evidence he could give a\\ncertificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the\\ncoroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily\\nto the same result.\\n\\n\\nWhen the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next\\nstep, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full\\nconfidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be\\nkept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful\\nto see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of\\ndespair. \"There must be no concealment,\" she said, \"Alas! we have had\\ntoo much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can\\ngive me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!\\nWhatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!\"\\nVan Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly\\nbut quietly:--\\n\\n\\n\"But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for\\nothers from yourself, after what has happened?\" Her face grew set in its\\nlines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she\\nanswered:--\\n\\n\\n\"Ah no! for my mind is made up!\"\\n\\n\\n\"To what?\" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in\\nour own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer\\ncame with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--\\n\\n\\n\"Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of\\nharm to any that I love, I shall die!\"\\n\\n\\n\"You would not kill yourself?\" he asked, hoarsely.\\n\\n\\n\"I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a\\npain, and so desperate an effort!\" She looked at him meaningly as she\\nspoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and\\nput his hand on her head as he said solemnly:\\n\\n\\n\"My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I\\ncould hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,\\neven at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my\\nchild----\" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his\\nthroat; he gulped it down and went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not\\ndie. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until\\nthe other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not\\ndie; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make\\nyou even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to\\nlive, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death\\nhimself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the\\nnight; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you\\ndo not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.\" The\\npoor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a\\nquicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all\\nsilent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to\\nhim said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--\\n\\n\\n\"I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall\\nstrive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may\\nhave passed away from me.\" She was so good and brave that we all felt\\nthat our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we\\nbegan to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all\\nthe papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we\\nmight hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.\\nShe was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if \"pleased\" could\\nbe used in connection with so grim an interest.\\n\\n\\nAs usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was\\nprepared with an exact ordering of our work.\\n\\n\\n\"It is perhaps well,\" he said, \"that at our meeting after our visit to\\nCarfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay\\nthere. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and\\nwould doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an\\neffort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our\\nintentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a\\npower exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use\\nthem as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as\\nto their disposition that, when we have examined the house in\\nPiccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;\\nand in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning\\nguards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must\\nretain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations\\nof his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear\\nthrough cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he\\nmust open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out\\nall his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch\\nhim and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching\\nand the destroying shall be, in time, sure.\" Here I started up for I\\ncould not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so\\npreciously laden with Mina\\'s life and happiness were flying from us,\\nsince whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up\\nhis hand warningly. \"Nay, friend Jonathan,\" he said, \"in this, the\\nquickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all\\nact and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in\\nall probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.\\nThe Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have\\ndeeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he\\nwrite on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings\\nthat he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,\\nwhere he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the\\nvery vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and\\nsearch that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our\\nfriend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt \\'stop the earths\\' and so we\\nrun down our old fox--so? is it not?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Then let us come at once,\" I cried, \"we are wasting the precious,\\nprecious time!\" The Professor did not move, but simply said:--\\n\\n\\n\"And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Any way!\" I cried. \"We shall break in if need be.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?\"\\n\\n\\nI was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good\\nreason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am\\nin.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to\\nyour anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at\\nmovement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it\\nseems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get\\ninto the house, but we have no key; is it not so?\" I nodded.\\n\\n\\n\"Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could\\nnot still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the\\nhousebreaker, what would you do?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the\\nlock for me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And your police, they would interfere, would they not?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Then,\" he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, \"all that is in doubt is\\nthe conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to\\nwhether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your\\npolice must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading\\nthe heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my\\nfriend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this\\nyour London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such\\nthings are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,\\nno one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine\\nhouse in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland\\nand lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and\\ngot in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out\\nand in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he\\nhave an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;\\nand when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of\\nthat other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him\\nthat house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away\\nwithin a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all\\nthey can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland\\nhe find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done\\n_en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. We shall not go\\nso early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem\\nit strange; but we shall go after ten o\\'clock, when there are many\\nabout, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the\\nhouse.\"\\n\\n\\nI could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina\\'s\\nface became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van\\nHelsing went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of\\nus can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be\\nmore earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End.\"\\n\\n\\nLord Godalming stood up. \"I can be of some use here,\" he said. \"I shall\\nwire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most\\nconvenient.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Look here, old fellow,\" said Morris, \"it is a capital idea to have all\\nready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don\\'t you think that one\\nof your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of\\nWalworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?\\nIt seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and\\neven leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Friend Quincey is right!\" said the Professor. \"His head is what you\\ncall in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to\\ndo, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.\"\\n\\n\\nMina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see\\nthat the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the\\nterrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost\\nghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in\\nsomewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give\\nher needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of\\nwhat had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As\\nyet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet\\nwas short, and there was time for fear.\\n\\n\\nWhen we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the\\ndisposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was\\nfinally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the\\nCount\\'s lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we\\nshould thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his\\npresence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us\\nsome new clue.\\n\\n\\nAs to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,\\nafter our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;\\nthat the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming\\nand Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.\\nIt was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count\\nmight appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be\\nable to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to\\nfollow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as\\nmy going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect\\nMina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would\\nnot listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter\\nin which I could be useful; that amongst the Count\\'s papers might be\\nsome clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;\\nand that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to\\ncope with the Count\\'s extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina\\'s\\nresolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that\\nwe should all work together. \"As for me,\" she said, \"I have no fear.\\nThings have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must\\nhave in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if\\nHe wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.\" So I\\nstarted up crying out: \"Then in God\\'s name let us come at once, for we\\nare losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we\\nthink.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Not so!\" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.\\n\\n\\n\"But why?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n\"Do you forget,\" he said, with actually a smile, \"that last night he\\nbanqueted heavily, and will sleep late?\"\\n\\n\\nDid I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that\\nterrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but\\nthe pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and\\nshuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her\\nfrightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in\\nthe affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,\\nhe was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. \"Oh,\\nMadam Mina,\" he said, \"dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so\\nreverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old\\nlips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will\\nforget it, will you not?\" He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took\\nhis hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--\\n\\n\\n\"No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I\\nhave so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all\\ntogether. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we\\nmust all eat that we may be strong.\"\\n\\n\\nBreakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and\\nencourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of\\nus. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we\\nall armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy\\'s\\nlair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?\" We all assured\\nhim. \"Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe\\nhere until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall\\nreturn! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I\\nhave myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing\\nof things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard\\nyourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the\\nname of the Father, the Son, and----\"\\n\\n\\nThere was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he\\nhad placed the Wafer on Mina\\'s forehead, it had seared it--had burned\\ninto the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor\\ndarling\\'s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as\\nher nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that\\nher overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the\\nwords to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased\\nto ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her\\nknees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair\\nover her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--\\n\\n\\n\"Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must\\nbear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.\" They\\nall paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless\\ngrief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our\\nsorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away\\ntheir eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said\\ngravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some\\nway inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--\\n\\n\\n\"It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,\\nas He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of\\nthe earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam\\nMina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that\\nred scar, the sign of God\\'s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,\\nand leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as\\nwe live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the\\nburden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did\\nin obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of\\nHis good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other\\nthrough stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and\\nfears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.\"\\n\\n\\nThere was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.\\nMina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old\\nman\\'s hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all\\nknelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each\\nother. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the\\nhead of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help\\nand guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.\\n\\n\\nIt was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which\\nneither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.\\n\\n\\nTo one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a\\nvampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible\\nland alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant\\nmany; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so\\nthe holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.\\n\\n\\nWe entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on\\nthe first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic\\nsurroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such\\nfear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there\\nnot been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded\\nwith our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and\\nin the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.\\nDr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--\\n\\n\\n\"And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this\\nearth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far\\ndistant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has\\nbeen holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more\\nholy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to\\nGod.\" As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and\\nvery soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled\\nmusty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention\\nwas concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the\\nSacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down\\nthe lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.\\n\\n\\nOne by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left\\nthem as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion\\nof the Host.\\n\\n\\nWhen we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--\\n\\n\\n\"So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can\\nbe so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam\\nMina\\'s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!\"\\n\\n\\nAs we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our\\ntrain we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the\\nwindow of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to\\ntell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in\\nreply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her\\nhand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station\\nand just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the\\nplatform.\\n\\n\\nI have written this in the train.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Piccadilly, 12:30 o\\'clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street\\nLord Godalming said to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in\\ncase there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it\\nwouldn\\'t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a\\nsolicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you\\nshould have known better.\" I demurred as to my not sharing any danger\\neven of odium, but he went on: \"Besides, it will attract less attention\\nif there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with\\nthe locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had\\nbetter go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,\\nsomewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and\\nthe smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the\\nlookout for you, and shall let you in.\"\\n\\n\\n\"The advice is good!\" said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming\\nand Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner\\nof Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green\\nPark. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was\\ncentred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst\\nits more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench\\nwithin good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little\\nattention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we\\nwaited for the coming of the others.\\n\\n\\nAt length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely\\nfashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended\\na thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid\\nthe cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two\\nascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.\\nThe workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes\\nof the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered\\nalong. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down\\nplaced his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a\\nselection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly\\nfashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and\\nturning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and\\nthe man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he\\nbegan to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling\\nabout for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the\\ndoor opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others\\nentered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van\\nHelsing\\'s went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the\\nworkman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly\\nopen, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.\\nThis he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and\\ngave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his\\ncoat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole\\ntransaction.\\n\\n\\nWhen the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at\\nthe door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood\\nLord Godalming lighting a cigar.\\n\\n\\n\"The place smells so vilely,\" said the latter as we came in. It did\\nindeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our\\nprevious experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the\\nplace pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together\\nin case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal\\nwith, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the\\nhouse. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found\\neight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!\\nOur work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the\\nmissing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out\\nacross a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,\\npointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no\\nwindows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not\\nlose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had\\nbrought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had\\ntreated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the\\nCount was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for\\nany of his effects.\\n\\n\\nAfter a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,\\nwe came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects\\nwhich might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine\\nthem. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room\\ntable. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;\\ndeeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;\\nnote-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin\\nwrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes\\nbrush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing\\ndirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a\\nlittle heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to\\nthe other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming\\nand Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the\\nhouses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great\\nbunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us\\nare, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of\\nthe Count.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\n\\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_3 October._--The time seemed terrible long whilst we were waiting for\\nthe coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep\\nour minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent\\npurpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.\\nThe poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.\\nLast night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful\\nface, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,\\nhaggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning\\neyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in\\nfact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if\\nall go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,\\nin a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I\\nthought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows\\nthis well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he\\nhas been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So\\nwell as I can remember, here it is:--\\n\\n\\n\"I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all\\nthe papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the\\ngreater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there\\nare signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of\\nit. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,\\nhe was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and\\nalchemist--which latter was the highest development of the\\nscience-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond\\ncompare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to\\nattend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time\\nthat he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the\\nphysical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.\\nIn some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is\\ngrowing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of\\nman\\'s stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not\\nbeen that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we\\nfail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must\\nlead through Death, not Life.\"\\n\\n\\nHarker groaned and said, \"And this is all arrayed against my darling!\\nBut how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!\"\\n\\n\\n\"He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but\\nsurely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as\\nyet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain\\nthings he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means\\nto succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait\\nand to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I fail to understand,\" said Harker wearily. \"Oh, do be more plain to\\nme! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this\\nmonster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been\\nmaking use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend\\nJohn\\'s home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when\\nand how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by\\nan inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not\\nsee how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He\\nknew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great\\nchild-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he\\nmight not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he\\nfound that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he\\nprogress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where\\nthey are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So\\nthat he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his\\nform, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his\\nhiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him\\njust too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;\\nand before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he\\ncan move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is\\nthere not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even\\nmore careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be\\nwell, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our\\nday, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are\\nfive of us when those absent ones return.\"\\n\\n\\nWhilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the\\ndouble postman\\'s knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the\\nhall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to\\nkeep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a\\ndespatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the\\ndirection, opened it and read aloud.\\n\\n\\n\"Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and\\nhastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want\\nto see you: Mina.\"\\n\\n\\nThere was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker\\'s voice:--\\n\\n\\n\"Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!\" Van Helsing turned to him\\nquickly and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice\\nas yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I care for nothing now,\" he answered hotly, \"except to wipe out this\\nbrute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, hush, hush, my child!\" said Van Helsing. \"God does not purchase\\nsouls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep\\nfaith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your\\ndevotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be\\ndoubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are\\nall devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is\\ncoming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,\\nand till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive\\nhere--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times\\nbefore he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for\\nis that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.\"\\n\\n\\nAbout half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker\\'s telegram, there\\ncame a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary\\nknock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made\\nthe Professor\\'s heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and\\ntogether moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various\\narmaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van\\nHelsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood\\nback, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts\\nmust have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we\\nsaw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed\\nthe door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the\\nhall:--\\n\\n\\n\"It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we\\ndestroyed them all!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Destroyed?\" asked the Professor.\\n\\n\\n\"For him!\" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn\\'t turn up\\nby five o\\'clock, we must start off; for it won\\'t do to leave Mrs. Harker\\nalone after sunset.\"\\n\\n\\n\"He will be here before long now,\" said Van Helsing, who had been\\nconsulting his pocket-book. \"_Nota bene_, in Madam\\'s telegram he went\\nsouth from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could\\nonly do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one\\no\\'clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only\\nsuspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would\\nsuspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a\\nshort time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to\\nMile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be\\ncarried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not\\nhave long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that\\nwe may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your\\narms! Be ready!\" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could\\nhear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.\\n\\n\\nI could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a\\ndominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and\\nadventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always\\nbeen the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been\\naccustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be\\nrenewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once\\nlaid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a\\ngesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were\\njust behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could\\nguard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.\\nGodalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to\\nmove in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the\\nseconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along\\nthe hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least\\nhe feared it.\\n\\n\\nSuddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past\\nus before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something\\nso panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed\\nto sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was\\nHarker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door\\nleading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a\\nhorrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long\\nand pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of\\nlion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single\\nimpulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some\\nbetter organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what\\nwe were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would\\navail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had\\nready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The\\nblow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count\\'s\\nleap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne\\nthrough his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,\\nmaking a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold\\nfell out. The expression of the Count\\'s face was so hellish, that for a\\nmoment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife\\naloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a\\nprotective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I\\nfelt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I\\nsaw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously\\nby each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of\\nhate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over\\nthe Count\\'s face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast\\nof his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the\\npallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous\\ndive he swept under Harker\\'s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping\\na handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw\\nhimself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,\\nhe tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the\\nshivering glass I could hear the \"ting\" of the gold, as some of the\\nsovereigns fell on the flagging.\\n\\n\\nWe ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up\\nthe steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.\\nThere he turned and spoke to us:--\\n\\n\\n\"You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like\\nsheep in a butcher\\'s. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think\\nyou have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is\\njust begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your\\ngirls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and\\nothers shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my\\njackals when I want to feed. Bah!\" With a contemptuous sneer, he passed\\nquickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he\\nfastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us\\nto speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following\\nhim through the stable, we moved toward the hall.\\n\\n\\n\"We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he\\nfears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His\\nvery tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You\\nfollow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For\\nme, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he\\nreturn.\" As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took\\nthe title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the\\nremaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with\\na match.\\n\\n\\nGodalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had\\nlowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,\\nbolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there\\nwas no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back\\nof the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.\\n\\n\\nIt was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to\\nrecognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the\\nProfessor when he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do\\njust now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need\\nnot despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find\\nit; when that is done all may yet be well.\" I could see that he spoke as\\nbravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken\\ndown; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he\\nwas thinking of his wife.\\n\\n\\nWith sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker\\nwaiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her\\nbravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as\\npale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were\\nin secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--\\n\\n\\n\"I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!\" As she spoke,\\nshe took her husband\\'s grey head in her hands and kissed it--\"Lay your\\npoor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect\\nus if He so will it in His good intent.\" The poor fellow groaned. There\\nwas no place for words in his sublime misery.\\n\\n\\nWe had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us\\nall up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry\\npeople--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense\\nof companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less\\nmiserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to\\nour promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and\\nalthough she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to\\nthreaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was\\nmanifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the\\npart where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to\\nher husband\\'s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could\\nprotect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,\\ntill the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up\\nto the present time. Then without letting go her husband\\'s hand she\\nstood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the\\nscene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty\\nof her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which\\nshe was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our\\nteeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against\\nour grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and\\nwe, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and\\npurity and faith, was outcast from God.\\n\\n\\n\"Jonathan,\" she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was\\nso full of love and tenderness, \"Jonathan dear, and you all my true,\\ntrue friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this\\ndreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as\\nyou destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;\\nbut it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this\\nmisery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when\\nhe, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have\\nspiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may\\nnot hold your hands from his destruction.\"\\n\\n\\nAs she spoke I could see her husband\\'s face darken and draw together, as\\nthough the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.\\nInstinctively the clasp on his wife\\'s hand grew closer, till his\\nknuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she\\nmust have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing\\nthan ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing\\nhis hand from hers as he spoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that\\nearthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send\\nhis soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don\\'t say such things,\\nJonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just\\nthink, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that\\n... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some\\nother like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,\\nmy husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought\\nhad there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured\\nyour wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and\\nsorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence\\nof what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom\\nso many sorrows have come.\"\\n\\n\\nWe men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept\\nopenly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.\\nHer husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms\\nround her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned\\nto us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone\\nwith their God.\\n\\n\\nBefore they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming\\nof the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.\\nShe tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her\\nhusband\\'s sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,\\nI think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at\\nhand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.\\nWhen they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should\\nsit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the\\npoor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us\\nshall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,\\nfor his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go\\nto bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end.\\nThere was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief\\nthat to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must\\nnow be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step\\nwas to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one\\nearth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he\\nchooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the\\nmeantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.\\nThis I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that\\none is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her\\nsweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster\\nseem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer\\nby the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting\\nreefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is\\nsleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be\\nlike, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so\\ncalm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came\\nover her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.\\nI thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her\\nface, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy\\nmyself, though I am weary--weary to death. However, I must try to sleep;\\nfor there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me\\nuntil....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was\\nsitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily,\\nfor we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning hand\\nover my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--\\n\\n\\n\"Hush! there is someone in the corridor!\" I got up softly, and crossing\\nthe room, gently opened the door.\\n\\n\\nJust outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He\\nraised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all\\nnight. We don\\'t mean to take any chances!\"\\n\\n\\nHis look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.\\nShe sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale\\nface as she put her arms round me and said softly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, thank God for good brave men!\" With a sigh she sank back again to\\nsleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_4 October, morning._--Once again during the night I was wakened by\\nMina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming\\ndawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was\\nlike a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Why?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n\"I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured\\nwithout my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I\\nshall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.\" I\\nwent to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing\\nme, he sprang to his feet.\\n\\n\\n\"Is anything wrong?\" he asked, in alarm.\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" I replied; \"but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I will go,\" he said, and hurried into the Professor\\'s room.\\n\\n\\nIn two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his\\ndressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at\\nthe door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile--a\\npositive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he\\nsaid:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,\\nwe have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!\" Then\\nturning to her, he said, cheerfully: \"And what am I do for you? For at\\nthis hour you do not want me for nothings.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I want you to hypnotise me!\" she said. \"Do it before the dawn, for I\\nfeel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is\\nshort!\" Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.\\n\\n\\nLooking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,\\nfrom over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina\\ngazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat\\nlike a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually\\nher eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of\\nher bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few\\nmore passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was\\ncovered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she\\ndid not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and\\nher voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to\\nimpose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.\\nThey came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the\\nfoot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The\\nstillness was broken by Van Helsing\\'s voice speaking in a low level tone\\nwhich would not break the current of her thoughts:--\\n\\n\\n\"Where are you?\" The answer came in a neutral way:--\\n\\n\\n\"I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.\" For several\\nminutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood\\nstaring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room\\nwas growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina\\'s face, Dr. Van\\nHelsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed\\njust upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse\\nitself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--\\n\\n\\n\"Where are you now?\" The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it\\nwere as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the\\nsame tone when reading her shorthand notes.\\n\\n\\n\"I do not know. It is all strange to me!\"\\n\\n\\n\"What do you see?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I can see nothing; it is all dark.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What do you hear?\" I could detect the strain in the Professor\\'s patient\\nvoice.\\n\\n\\n\"The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can\\nhear them on the outside.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Then you are on a ship?\" We all looked at each other, trying to glean\\nsomething each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came\\nquick:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\"\\n\\n\\n\"What else do you hear?\"\\n\\n\\n\"The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the\\ncreaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan\\nfalls into the rachet.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n\\n\"I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!\" The voice faded away into\\na deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.\\n\\n\\nBy this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of\\nday. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina\\'s shoulders, and laid her\\nhead down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few\\nmoments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see\\nus all around her. \"Have I been talking in my sleep?\" was all she said.\\nShe seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she\\nwas eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the\\nconversation, and she said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!\" Mr.\\nMorris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor\\'s calm\\nvoice called them back:--\\n\\n\\n\"Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor\\nwhilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in\\nyour so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be\\nthanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we\\nknow not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,\\nsince when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking\\nforward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but\\nthat sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the\\nCount\\'s mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan\\'s so fierce\\nknife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear\\nme, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men\\nfollowing like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He\\nhave take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He\\nthink to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would\\nsay when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and\\nwe must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a\\nlittle while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters\\nbetween us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he\\nwould--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or\\nslack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to\\nus. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,\\nand which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with\\nus.\" Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--\\n\\n\\n\"But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?\" He\\ntook her hand and patted it as he replied:--\\n\\n\\n\"Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all\\nquestions.\" He would say no more, and we separated to dress.\\n\\n\\nAfter breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for\\na minute and then said sorrowfully:--\\n\\n\\n\"Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him\\neven if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!\" She grew paler as\\nshe asked faintly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Because,\" he answered solemnly, \"he can live for centuries, and you are\\nbut mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded--since once he put that mark\\nupon your throat.\"\\n\\n\\nI was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\n\\nDR. SEWARD\\'S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis to Jonathan Harker.\\n\\n\\nYou are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make our\\nsearch--if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we\\nseek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-day.\\nThis is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find him\\nhere. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already,\\nfor I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back\\nto his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of\\nfire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and\\nthat last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the\\nmoney; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun\\ngo down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that\\nhe think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.\\nBut there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last\\nresource--his last earth-work I might say did I wish _double entente_.\\nHe is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; and\\nso he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came,\\nand he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;\\nwhen we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will\\ncomfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope\\nwhen you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we\\npursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in\\none day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is\\nfinite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.\\nBut we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong\\ntogether. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is\\nbut begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that God sits on high\\nto watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.\\n\\n\\nVAN HELSING.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_4 October._--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing\\'s message in the\\nphonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the\\ncertainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;\\nand comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible\\ndanger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to\\nbelieve in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem\\nlike a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright\\nsunlight----\\n\\n\\nAlas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on\\nthe red scar on my poor darling\\'s white forehead. Whilst that lasts,\\nthere can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will\\nkeep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been\\nover all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality\\nseems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is\\nsomething of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.\\nMina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It may\\nbe! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each other\\nyet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor and\\nthe others after their investigations.\\n\\n\\nThe day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run\\nfor me again. It is now three o\\'clock.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_5 October, 5 p. m._--Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van\\nHelsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan\\nHarker, Mina Harker.\\n\\n\\nDr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to\\ndiscover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--\\n\\n\\n\"As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that\\nhe must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since\\nby that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne\\nignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what\\nships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since\\nMadam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in\\nyour list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of\\nLord Godalming, to your Lloyd\\'s, where are note of all ships that sail,\\nhowever so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go\\nout with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from\\nDoolittle\\'s Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the\\nDanube. \\'Soh!\\' said I, \\'this is the ship whereon is the Count.\\' So off\\nwe go to Doolittle\\'s Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood\\nso small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire\\nof the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face\\nand loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey\\ngive him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and\\nput it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he\\nstill better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask\\nmany men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they\\nhave been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of\\nothers which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but\\nnevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.\\n\\n\\n\"They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five\\no\\'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose\\nand teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in\\nblack, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the\\ntime. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship\\nsails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and\\nthen to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of\\ngang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when\\ntold that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he\\nagree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse\\nand cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself\\ndriving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it\\ntake several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to\\ncaptain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like\\nit not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he\\ncan come and see where it shall be. But he say \\'no\\'; that he come not\\nyet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he\\nhad better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the\\nplace--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thin\\nman smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he\\nwill be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,\\npolyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he\\nwill so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the\\nsailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell\\nhim that he doesn\\'t want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also\\nwith blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking\\nwhere there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship\\nforms, he departed.\\n\\n\\n\"No one knew where he went \\'or bloomin\\' well cared,\\' as they said, for\\nthey had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon\\nbecame apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as\\nwas expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,\\nand grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.\\nThe captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and\\nblood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to\\nfear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,\\nwhen just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and\\nasked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied\\nthat he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and\\nblood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down\\nwith the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile\\non deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.\\nIndeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and\\nall was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was\\nof bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain\\'s swears\\nexceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of\\npicturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up\\nand down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any\\nof fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship\\nwent out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the\\nriver mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.\\n\\n\\n\"And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for\\nour enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the\\nDanube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when\\nwe start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope\\nis to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then\\nhe can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There\\nare days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about\\nwhere he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us\\ninvoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in\\nVarna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present\\nhis credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.\\nWhen he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and\\nhave inquiry made at Varna, we say \\'no\\'; for what is to be done is not\\nfor police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own\\nway.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain\\nthat the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: \"We have the\\nbest proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this\\nmorning.\" I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should\\npursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that\\nhe would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,\\nat first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more\\nforceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some\\nof that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst\\nmen:--\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,\\nand then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm\\nalready, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short\\ntime when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in\\ndarkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my\\ndear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or\\nin that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his\\nown barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life\\nof man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the\\nwork of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do\\nwhat he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have\\nbeen, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of\\nnature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in\\nsome wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for\\nall these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical\\nworld. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.\\nThere have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters\\nof strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,\\nthere is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of\\noccult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in\\nhimself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike\\ntime he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,\\nmore braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in\\nstrange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and\\nthrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which\\nis surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,\\nand are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have\\ninfect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for\\ngood of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do\\nno more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and\\nso in time, death, which is of man\\'s common lot and with God\\'s sanction,\\nshall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together\\nthat it must not. Thus are we ministers of God\\'s own wish: that the\\nworld, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,\\nwhose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one\\nsoul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem\\nmore. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if\\nwe fall, we fall in good cause.\" He paused and I said:--\\n\\n\\n\"But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven\\nfrom England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from\\nwhich he has been hunted?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Aha!\" he said, \"your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall\\nadopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once\\ntasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl\\nunceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a\\ntiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he\\nis not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go\\nover the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be\\nbeaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.\\nLook at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to\\nhim he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What\\ndoes he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for\\nhim. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He\\nfind in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He\\nstudy new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old\\nways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new\\nland and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that\\nhe have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help\\nhim to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at\\nthe first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a\\nruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater\\nworld of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know\\nhim; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole\\npeoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,\\nwhat a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we\\nare pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our\\nefforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not\\neven what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest\\nstrength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons\\nto destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls\\nfor the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the\\nhonour and glory of God.\"\\n\\n\\nAfter a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing\\nbe definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to\\nthink out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to\\nmeet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we\\nshall decide on some definite cause of action.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nI feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some haunting\\npresence were removed from me. Perhaps ...\\n\\n\\nMy surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the\\nmirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still\\nunclean.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for\\neach and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more\\ngeneral cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience\\nagain.\\n\\n\\nIt is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let\\nany obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by\\ndeath--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More\\nthan once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether\\nthe whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I\\ncaught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker\\'s forehead that I was\\nbrought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the\\nmatter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our\\ntrouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her\\ntrouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something\\nrecalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to\\nmeet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of\\naction. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct\\nrather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear\\nthat in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker\\'s tongue is tied. I _know_\\nthat she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can\\nguess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or\\ncannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and\\nhe and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of\\nthat horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The\\nCount had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called \"the\\nVampire\\'s baptism of blood.\" Well, there may be a poison that distils\\nitself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is\\na mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my\\ninstinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker\\'s silences, then there is a\\nterrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same\\npower that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think\\nfurther; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall\\ntry to open the subject with him.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of\\nthings. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to\\nsay, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating\\nabout the bush a little, he said suddenly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just\\nat the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our\\nconfidence\"; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.\" A cold shiver ran\\nthrough me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing\\ncontinued:--\\n\\n\\n\"With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned\\nbefore things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than\\never, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I\\ncan see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now\\nbut very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice\\nwithout to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes\\nare more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now\\noften; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she\\nwrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If\\nit be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and\\nhear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who\\nhave drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he\\nwill, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?\" I nodded\\nacquiescence; he went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of\\nour intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful\\ntask! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.\\nWhen to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not\\nto speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by\\nus.\" He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration\\nat the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor\\nsoul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort\\nto him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at\\nany rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the\\neffect was as I expected.\\n\\n\\nIt is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has\\ngone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I\\nreally believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was\\nexperienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a\\nmessage by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as\\nshe thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements\\nwithout her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each\\nother for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own\\npart, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was\\nmuch pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we\\nagreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to\\npreserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to\\nconfer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van\\nHelsing roughly put the facts before us first:--\\n\\n\\n\"The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take\\nher at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to\\nreach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.\\nNow, if we allow for two days less for the ship\\'s voyage, owing to such\\nweather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if\\nwe allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,\\nthen we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite\\nsafe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate\\nbe in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such\\npreparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed\\nagainst evil things, spiritual as well as physical.\" Here Quincey Morris\\nadded:--\\n\\n\\n\"I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be\\nthat he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to\\nour armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any\\ntrouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack\\nafter us at Tobolsk? What wouldn\\'t we have given then for a repeater\\napiece!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Good!\" said Van Helsing, \"Winchesters it shall be. Quincey\\'s head is\\nlevel at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more\\ndishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we\\ncan do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of\\nus, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.\\nTo-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we\\nfour can set out on our journey.\"\\n\\n\\n\"We four?\" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of\\nus.\\n\\n\\n\"Of course!\" answered the Professor quickly, \"you must remain to take\\ncare of your so sweet wife!\" Harker was silent for awhile and then said\\nin a hollow voice:--\\n\\n\\n\"Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with\\nMina.\" I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not\\nto disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him\\nsignificantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and\\nturned away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I\\ncould not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of\\nwonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina\\'s determination not\\nto take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not\\nargue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from\\na solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the\\nlast time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no\\nmore concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly\\nand sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams\\nwith happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina\\'s happy sleep, and\\ncame as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the\\nevening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking\\nlower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at\\nonce Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A\\npromise made to me, but made holily in God\\'s hearing, and not to be\\nbroken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter\\ntears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Mina,\" I said, \"a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have\\nno right to make it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But, dear one,\" she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes\\nwere like pole stars, \"it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.\\nYou can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may\\ndo as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved\\nfrom the promise.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I promise!\" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though\\nto me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.\\nShe said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for\\nthe campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or\\nimplication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!\" and she\\nsolemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said\\nsolemnly:--\\n\\n\\n\"I promise!\" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had\\nbeen shut between us.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.\\nSo much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected\\nsomewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall\\nof gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired\\nearly. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing\\nthat her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible\\ntrouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.\\nPerhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall\\ntry it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the\\nsame time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought\\nthat it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went\\nfor the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found\\nhim dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the\\nopening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the\\nroom, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" she said quite simply, \"it will not be necessary. You can tell\\nthem just as well. I must go with you on your journey.\"\\n\\n\\nDr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment\\'s pause he\\nasked:--\\n\\n\\n\"But why?\"\\n\\n\\n\"You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,\\ntoo.\"\\n\\n\\n\"But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest\\nduty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than\\nany of us from--from circumstances--things that have been.\" He paused,\\nembarrassed.\\n\\n\\nAs she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--\\n\\n\\n\"I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is\\ncoming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me\\nI must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by\\nwile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan.\" God saw the look that\\nshe turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel\\nthat look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her\\nhand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of\\ntears. She went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you\\ncan defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had\\nto guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me\\nand so learn that which even I myself do not know.\" Dr. Van Helsing said\\nvery gravely:--\\n\\n\\n\"Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and\\ntogether we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.\" When he had\\nspoken, Mina\\'s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen\\nback on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up\\nthe blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing\\nmotioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within\\na minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.\\nHe told them what Mina had said, and went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a\\nnew factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony\\nto tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are\\nwarned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be\\nready to act the instant when that ship arrives.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What shall we do exactly?\" asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor\\npaused before replying:--\\n\\n\\n\"We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified\\nthe box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall\\nfasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the\\nsuperstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was\\nman\\'s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,\\nwhen we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we\\nshall open the box, and--and all will be well.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I shall not wait for any opportunity,\" said Morris. \"When I see the box\\nI shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand\\nmen looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!\" I\\ngrasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.\\nI think he understood my look; I hope he did.\\n\\n\\n\"Good boy,\" said Dr. Van Helsing. \"Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God\\nbless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or\\npause from any fear. I do but say what we may do--what we must do. But,\\nindeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things\\nwhich may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that\\nuntil the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and\\nwhen the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now\\nlet us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch\\non others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us\\ncan tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own\\naffairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make\\narrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for\\nour journey.\"\\n\\n\\nThere was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle\\nup all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she\\nsurvive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who\\nhave been so good to us shall have remainder.\\n\\n\\nIt is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina\\'s uneasiness calls my\\nattention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the\\ntime of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing\\ntimes for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new\\ndanger--some new pain, which, however, may in God\\'s will be means to a\\ngood end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must\\nnot hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they\\nshall be ready.\\n\\n\\nShe is calling to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\n\\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he\\nsays he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.\\n\\n\\nI think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.\\nHarker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to\\nunderstand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;\\nwhen her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing\\nor restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition\\nbegins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts\\ntill either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with\\nthe rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of\\nnegative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute\\nfreedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the\\nchange-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of\\nwarning silence.\\n\\n\\nTo-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the\\nsigns of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a\\nviolent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few\\nminutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning\\nher husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,\\nshe made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband\\'s hand\\nin hers began:--\\n\\n\\n\"We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,\\ndear; I know that you will always be with me to the end.\" This was to\\nher husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. \"In\\nthe morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in\\nstore for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me\\nwith you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak\\nwoman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate\\nat stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.\\nThere is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which\\nmust destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you\\nknow as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there\\nis one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!\" She looked\\nappealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.\\n\\n\\n\"What is that way?\" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. \"What is that\\nway, which we must not--may not--take?\"\\n\\n\\n\"That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before\\nthe greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I\\nonce dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you\\ndid my poor Lucy\\'s. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing\\nthat stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the\\nfriends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die\\nin such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be\\ndone, is God\\'s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the\\ncertainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the\\nblackest things that the world or the nether world holds!\" We were all\\nsilent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The\\nfaces of the others were set and Harker\\'s grew ashen grey; perhaps he\\nguessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--\\n\\n\\n\"This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.\" I could not but note the\\nquaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all\\nseriousness. \"What will each of you give? Your lives I know,\" she went\\non quickly, \"that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God\\'s, and you\\ncan give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?\" She looked\\nagain questioningly, but this time avoided her husband\\'s face. Quincey\\nseemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. \"Then I shall tell\\nyou plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this\\nconnection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you,\\nmy beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What is that time?\" The voice was Quincey\\'s, but it was low and\\nstrained.\\n\\n\\n\"When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that\\nI die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,\\nwithout a moment\\'s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;\\nor do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!\"\\n\\n\\nQuincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her\\nand taking her hand in his said solemnly:--\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m only a rough fellow, who hasn\\'t, perhaps, lived as a man should to\\nwin such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and\\ndear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty\\nthat you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all\\ncertain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has\\ncome!\"\\n\\n\\n\"My true friend!\" was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,\\nbending over, she kissed his hand.\\n\\n\\n\"I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!\" said Van Helsing.\\n\\n\\n\"And I!\" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to\\ntake the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her\\nwan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of\\nhis hair, and asked:--\\n\\n\\n\"And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?\"\\n\\n\\n\"You too, my dearest,\" she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her\\nvoice and eyes. \"You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and\\nall the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all\\ntime. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed\\ntheir wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the\\nhands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because\\nthose that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men\\'s duty\\ntowards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my\\ndear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at\\nthe hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not\\nforgotten your mercy in poor Lucy\\'s case to him who loved\"--she stopped\\nwith a flying blush, and changed her phrase--\"to him who had best right\\nto give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make\\nit a happy memory of my husband\\'s life that it was his loving hand which\\nset me free from the awful thrall upon me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Again I swear!\" came the Professor\\'s resonant voice. Mrs. Harker\\nsmiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and\\nsaid:--\\n\\n\\n\"And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:\\nthis time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in\\nsuch case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a\\ntime I myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued\\nwith your enemy against you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"One more request;\" she became very solemn as she said this, \"it is not\\nvital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for\\nme, if you will.\" We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need\\nto speak:--\\n\\n\\n\"I want you to read the Burial Service.\" She was interrupted by a deep\\ngroan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her\\nheart, and continued: \"You must read it over me some day. Whatever may\\nbe the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet\\nthought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for\\nthen it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!\"\\n\\n\\n\"But oh, my dear one,\" he pleaded, \"death is afar off from you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Nay,\" she said, holding up a warning hand. \"I am deeper in death at\\nthis moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, my wife, must I read it?\" he said, before he began.\\n\\n\\n\"It would comfort me, my husband!\" was all she said; and he began to\\nread when she had got the book ready.\\n\\n\\n\"How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its\\nsolemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its\\nsweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter\\ntruth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart\\nhad he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling\\nround that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of\\nher husband\\'s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he\\nhad to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial\\nof the Dead. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!\"\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nShe was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may\\nhereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it\\ncomforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker\\'s coming\\nrelapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any\\nof us as we had dreaded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_15 October, Varna._--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,\\ngot to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the\\nOrient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five\\no\\'clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had\\narrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--\"the\\nOdessus.\" The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager\\nto get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into\\nport there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.\\nThank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is\\ncoming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept\\nnearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very\\nwakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to\\nhypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he\\nhad to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by\\nhabit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at\\nthese particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He\\nalways asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--\\n\\n\\n\"Nothing; all is dark.\" And to the second:--\\n\\n\\n\"I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing\\nby. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is\\nhigh--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.\"\\nIt is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on\\nher way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four\\ntelegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:\\nthat the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd\\'s from\\nanywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should\\nsend him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He\\nwas to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be\\nsure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.\\n\\n\\nWe had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the\\nVice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship\\nas soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get\\non the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the\\nform of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and\\nso cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man\\'s form without\\nsuspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the\\nbox. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;\\nfor we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,\\nbefore he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for\\nmuch. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the\\nseamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,\\nand we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the\\nship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being\\nwarned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I\\nthink!\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_16 October._--Mina\\'s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing\\nwater, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and\\nwhen we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready. As she must\\npass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome\\nthe Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that\\nhe fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from\\na friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own\\nrisk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every\\nfacility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a\\nsimilar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who\\nwas much impressed with Godalming\\'s kindly manner to him, and we are all\\nsatisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We\\nhave already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the\\nCount is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and\\ndrive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall\\nprevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall\\nhave ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count\\'s body,\\nit will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no\\nevidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But\\neven if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps\\nsome day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and\\na rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it\\nwere to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our\\nintent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the\\n_Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a special\\nmessenger.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_24 October._--A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming,\\nbut only the same story: \"Not yet reported.\" Mina\\'s morning and evening\\nhypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking\\nmasts.\\n\\n\\n_Telegram, October 24th._\\n\\n\\n_Rufus Smith, Lloyd\\'s, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.\\nVice-Consul, Varna._\\n\\n\\n\"_Czarina Catherine_ reported this morning from Dardanelles.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_25 October._--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is\\nirksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with\\nexcitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd\\'s. I\\nknow now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.\\nHarker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After\\nall, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to\\nlet her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any\\nexcitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am\\nsure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but\\nin this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The\\nlethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is\\ngetting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We\\ntalk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It\\nwould break poor Harker\\'s heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that we\\nhad even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,\\nher teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for\\nhe says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active\\ndanger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be\\nnecessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to\\nbe, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should\\nneither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.\\n\"Euthanasia\" is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to\\nwhoever invented it.\\n\\n\\nIt is only about 24 hours\\' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the\\nrate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London. She should therefore\\narrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in\\nbefore then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one\\no\\'clock, so as to be ready.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_25 October, Noon_.--No news yet of the ship\\'s arrival. Mrs. Harker\\'s\\nhypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible\\nthat we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of\\nexcitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and\\nan hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife\\nwhich he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the\\nCount if the edge of that \"Kukri\" ever touches his throat, driven by\\nthat stern, ice-cold hand!\\n\\n\\nVan Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About\\nnoon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we\\nkept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She\\nhad been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know\\nthat she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually\\nthat she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to\\nher room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so\\nwell and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than\\nanything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder\\nthat sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep\\nof some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had\\nbeen for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he\\nmay be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To\\nhis doom, I trust!\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_26 October._--Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_.\\nShe ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying _somewhere_ is\\napparent, for Mrs. Harker\\'s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the\\nsame. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;\\nsome of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog\\nboth to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as\\nthe ship may now be signalled any moment.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_27 October, Noon._--Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.\\nMrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: \"lapping\\nwaves and rushing water,\" though she added that \"the waves were very\\nfaint.\" The telegrams from London have been the same: \"no further\\nreport.\" Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he\\nfears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:--\\n\\n\\n\"I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina\\'s. Souls and memories can do\\nstrange things during trance.\" I was about to ask him more, but Harker\\njust then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night\\nat sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n     _28 October._--Telegram. _Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,\\n     care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna._\\n\\n\\n     \"_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o\\'clock\\n     to-day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_28 October._--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I\\ndo not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been\\nexpected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would\\ncome; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.\\nThe delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things\\nwould not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the\\nchange would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose\\nthat nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against\\nourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know\\nthat they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if\\nit be a will-o\\'-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all\\ntook it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a\\nmoment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a\\nword, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord\\nGodalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half\\nstunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris\\ntightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our\\nold wandering days it meant \"action.\" Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so\\nthat the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands\\nmeekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled--actually smiled--the\\ndark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his\\naction belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of\\nthe great Kukri knife and rested there. \"When does the next train start\\nfor Galatz?\" said Van Helsing to us generally.\\n\\n\\n\"At 6:30 to-morrow morning!\" We all started, for the answer came from\\nMrs. Harker.\\n\\n\\n\"How on earth do you know?\" said Art.\\n\\n\\n\"You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so\\ndoes Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I\\nalways used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my\\nhusband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of\\nthe time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle\\nDracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I\\nlearned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,\\nas the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Wonderful woman!\" murmured the Professor.\\n\\n\\n\"Can\\'t we get a special?\" asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his\\nhead: \"I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even\\nif we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our\\nregular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.\\nNow let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the\\ntickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do\\nyou, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him\\nletters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship\\njust as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get\\nhis aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way\\nsmooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay\\nwith Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you\\nmay be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here\\nwith Madam to make report.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And I,\" said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she\\nhad been for many a long day, \"shall try to be of use in all ways, and\\nshall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting\\nfrom me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!\"\\nThe three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to\\nrealise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to\\neach other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the\\ntime, however.\\n\\n\\nWhen the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.\\nHarker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of\\nHarker\\'s journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door\\nwas shut upon her he said to me:--\\n\\n\\n\"We mean the same! speak out!\"\\n\\n\\n\"There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may\\ndeceive us.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?\"\\n\\n\\n\"No!\" said I, \"unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.\"\\n\\n\\n\"You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell\\nyou something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;\\nbut I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those\\nwords that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In\\nthe trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her\\nmind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship\\nwith water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn\\nthen that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with\\neyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.\\nNow he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.\\n\\n\\n\"He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;\\nbut he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that\\nso she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that\\nhave been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will\\ncome higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,\\nthat grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and\\ntherefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!\\nShe know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when\\nwe want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great\\nbrain which is trained like man\\'s brain, but is of sweet woman and have\\na special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away\\naltogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall\\nlearn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never\\nfeared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!\"\\n\\n\\nI thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,\\njust as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled\\nhimself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into\\nthe room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly\\nforgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets\\nof typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face\\nbrightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and\\nthumb he said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,\\ndear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to\\nthink. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to\\nlet him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to\\nwhere that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought\\nat all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet\\nstrong to use his little wings. Nay, like the \"Ugly Duck\" of my friend\\nHans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that\\nsail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I\\nread here what Jonathan have written:--\\n\\n\\n\"That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought\\nhis forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was\\nbeaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come\\nalone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,\\nsince he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count\\'s child-thought see\\nnothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my\\nman-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word\\nfrom some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what\\nit mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,\\nyet when in nature\\'s course they move on their way and they touch--then\\npouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill\\nand destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and\\nleagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever\\nstudy the philosophy of crime? \\'Yes\\' and \\'No.\\' You, John, yes; for it is\\na study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not\\nbut once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad\\nuniversale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,\\nin all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much\\nfrom philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to\\nbe empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true\\ncriminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.\\nThis criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and\\nresourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of\\nchild-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime\\nalso; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he\\nhave done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not\\nby principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to\\nhim the ground to start from to do more. \\'_Dos pou sto_,\\' said\\nArchimedes. \\'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!\\' To do once,\\nis the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have\\nthe purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,\\njust as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are\\nopened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,\" for\\nMrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with\\nthose so bright eyes.\" He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.\\nHis finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and\\nunconsciously, as she spoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would\\nso classify him, and _quâ_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.\\nThus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a\\nclue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own\\nlips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a\\n\\'tight place,\\' he went back to his own country from the land he had\\ntried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself\\nfor a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.\\nSo he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all\\nhope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over\\nthe sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube\\nfrom Turkey Land.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!\" said Van Helsing,\\nenthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he\\nsaid to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room\\nconsultation:--\\n\\n\\n\"Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.\" Turning to\\nher again, he said with keen expectation:--\\n\\n\\n\"But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;\\nJohn and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.\\nSpeak, without fear!\"\\n\\n\\n\"I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small\\nand his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one\\npurpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,\\nleaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being\\nsafe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat\\nfrom the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful\\nnight. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul\\nis freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me\\nis a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for\\nhis ends.\" The Professor stood up:--\\n\\n\\n\"He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,\\nwhilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to\\nGalatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.\\nBut his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in\\nGod\\'s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for\\nhis selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken\\nin his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he\\nis free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so\\nmany hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to\\nsleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,\\nthere can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That\\nterrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him\\nin spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the\\nsun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;\\nand this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your\\nsuffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know\\nit not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his\\nknowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe\\nthat God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark\\nhours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril\\nourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great\\nhour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe\\nand write him all down, so that when the others return from their work\\nyou can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker\\nhas written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\n\\n\\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last\\nnight we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us\\nhad done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,\\nand opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and\\nfor our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.\\nHarker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and\\nmore serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually\\nnecessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but\\nthis time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty\\nresolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--\\n\\n\\n\"I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a\\nsteady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear\\nmen\\'s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in\\nthe rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.\\nThere is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged\\nalong. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air\\nblowing upon me.\"\\n\\n\\nHere she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay\\non the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a\\nweight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.\\nQuincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst\\nHarker\\'s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There\\nwas a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was\\npassing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she\\nsat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!\" We\\ncould only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get\\ntea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n\\n\"You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his\\nearth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie\\nhidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do\\nnot touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be\\nin the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did\\nat Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he\\nbe carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men\\nmay discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on\\nshore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.\\nWe may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come\\non him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his\\ntrue self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.\"\\n\\n\\nThere was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;\\nat which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.\\n\\n\\nEarly this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her\\nresponse in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming\\nthan before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was\\nso short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole\\nsoul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made\\nreply:--\\n\\n\\n\"All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as\\nof wood on wood.\" She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till\\nto-night.\\n\\n\\nAnd so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of\\nexpectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;\\nbut already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot\\npossibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more\\nhypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw\\nmore light on what is happening.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when\\nthere was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a\\nstation, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.\\nMrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than\\nthis morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count\\'s\\nsensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that\\nher imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance\\nhitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes\\non it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count\\'s power\\nover her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be\\na happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did\\nspeak, her words were enigmatical:--\\n\\n\\n\"Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can\\nhear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,\\nfierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.\" She stopped and a\\nshudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,\\ntill, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even\\nin answer to the Professor\\'s imperative questioning. When she woke from\\nthe trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was\\nall alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;\\nwhen she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in\\nsilence.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time\\nto write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.\\nKnowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,\\nVan Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no\\neffect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still\\ngreater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor\\nlost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--\\n\\n\\n\"All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the\\ncreaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a\\nqueer one like----\" She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.\\n\\n\\n\"Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!\" said Van Helsing in an agonised\\nvoice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun\\nwas reddening even Mrs. Harker\\'s pale face. She opened her eyes, and we\\nall started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost\\nunconcern:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can\\'t? I don\\'t remember\\nanything.\" Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,\\nturning from one to the other with a troubled look:--\\n\\n\\n\"What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was\\nlying here, half asleep, and heard you say go on! speak, I command you!\\'\\nIt seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad\\nchild!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said, sadly, \"it is proof, if proof be needed, of\\nhow I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more\\nearnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I\\nam proud to obey!\"\\n\\n\\nThe whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with\\nanxiety and eagerness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_30 October._--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been\\nordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since\\nhe does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed\\nmuch as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the\\nVice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some\\nsort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two\\ndoctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival\\nof the _Czarina Catherine_.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the\\nVice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.\\nHe was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_30 October._--At nine o\\'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called\\non Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of\\nHapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord\\nGodalming\\'s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in\\ntheir power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once\\non board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river\\nharbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his\\nvoyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a\\nrun.\\n\\n\\n\"Man!\" he said, \"but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should\\nhave to pay for it wi\\' some rare piece o\\' ill luck, so as to keep up the\\naverage. It\\'s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi\\' a wind\\nahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin\\' on yer sail for his\\nain purpose. An\\' a\\' the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh\\na ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi\\' us,\\ntill when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could\\nwe see. We ran by Gibraltar wi\\'oot bein\\' able to signal; an\\' till we\\ncame to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we\\nnever were within hail o\\' aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail\\nand beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the\\nDeil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it\\nwhether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our\\nmiscredit wi\\' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an\\' the Old Mon who\\nhad served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no\\nhinderin\\' him.\" This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition\\nand commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and\\nhe know when he meet his match!\" The skipper was not displeased with the\\ncompliment, and went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o\\' them,\\nthe Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had\\nbeen put on board by a queer lookin\\' old man just before we had started\\nfrae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa\\nfingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the\\nsupersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot\\ntheir business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I\\nfelt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn\\'t say it was\\nagin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn\\'t let up for\\nfive days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get\\nsomewheres--well, he would fetch it up a\\'reet. An\\' if he didn\\'t, well,\\nwe\\'d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and\\ndeep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin\\' sun came\\nthrough the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.\\nThe Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the\\nbox and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi\\' them aboot it wi\\' a\\nhandspike; an\\' when the last o\\' them rose off the deck wi\\' his head in\\nhis hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the\\nproperty and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the\\nriver Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to\\nfling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I\\'d let it\\nlie till we discharged in the port an\\' get rid o\\'t althegither. We\\ndidn\\'t do much clearin\\' that day, an\\' had to remain the nicht at anchor;\\nbut in the mornin\\', braw an\\' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came\\naboard wi\\' an order, written to him from England, to receive a box\\nmarked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to\\nhis hand. He had his papers a\\' reet, an\\' glad I was to be rid o\\' the\\ndam\\' thing, for I was beginnin\\' masel\\' to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil\\ndid have any luggage aboord the ship, I\\'m thinkin\\' it was nane ither\\nthan that same!\"\\n\\n\\n\"What was the name of the man who took it?\" asked Dr. Van Helsing with\\nrestrained eagerness.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be tellin\\' ye quick!\" he answered, and, stepping down to his\\ncabin, produced a receipt signed \"Immanuel Hildesheim.\" Burgen-strasse\\n16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so\\nwith thanks we came away.\\n\\n\\nWe found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi\\nTheatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were\\npointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little\\nbargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but\\nimportant. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling\\nhim to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box\\nwhich would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to\\ngive in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks\\nwho traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by\\nan English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube\\nInternational Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to\\nthe ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all\\nhe knew.\\n\\n\\nWe then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his\\nneighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had\\ngone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by\\nhis landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house\\ntogether with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten\\nand eleven o\\'clock last night. We were at a standstill again.\\n\\n\\nWhilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that\\nthe body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of\\nSt. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild\\nanimal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the\\nwomen crying out \"This is the work of a Slovak!\" We hurried away lest we\\nshould have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.\\n\\n\\nAs we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all\\nconvinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where\\nthat might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home\\nto the hotel to Mina.\\n\\n\\nWhen we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina\\nagain into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at\\nleast a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was\\nreleased from my promise to her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_30 October, evening._--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited\\nthat there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked\\nthem all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything\\nup to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the\\n\"Traveller\\'s\" typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for\\nme. I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write\\nwith a pen....\\n\\n\\nIt is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,\\nwhat must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to\\nbreathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his\\nface is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can\\nsee his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh!\\nif I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can.\\n\\n\\nI have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I\\nhave not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all\\ncarefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to\\nfollow the Professor\\'s example, and think without prejudice on the facts\\nbefore me....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nI do believe that under God\\'s providence I have made a discovery. I\\nshall get the maps and look over them....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nI am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready, so\\nI shall get our party together and read it. They can judge it; it is\\nwell to be accurate, and every minute is precious.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Memorandum._\\n\\n\\n(Entered in her Journal.)\\n\\n\\n_Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula\\'s problem is to get back to his own\\nplace.\\n\\n\\n(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had he\\npower to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf,\\nor bat, or in some other way.

This is his highest fear; and in order\\nto prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even\\nhis victim--me!\\n\\n\\n2. _By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to\\ntake its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies\\non the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if\\nleft in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not\\nwhat he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.\\n\\n\\n3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most\\ndanger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even\\nthen he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were\\nhe wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would\\nindeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were\\nunfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would\\nstill be desperate.\\n\\n\\nWe know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do\\nis to ascertain _what_ water.\\n\\n\\nThe first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,\\nthen, get a light on what his later task is to be.\\n\\n\\n_Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part\\nof his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had\\nto arrange as best he could.\\n\\n\\n_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we\\nknow of, what he has done here.\\n\\n\\nAs to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent\\ninvoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of\\nexit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.\\nThe proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel\\nHildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is\\nalso the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but\\nthere must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to\\nHildesheim.\\n\\n\\nThat, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_\\nmade a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson\\'s\\nsuspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness\\nplayed the Count\\'s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind\\nthrough fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the\\nCount\\'s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared\\nthe box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here\\nwe lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,\\nmoving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been\\navoided.\\n\\n\\nNow we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on\\nland_, at Galatz.\\n\\n\\nThe box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could\\nappear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to\\naid in the work? In my husband\\'s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing\\nwith the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man\\'s\\nremark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general\\nfeeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.\\n\\n\\nMy surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his\\ncastle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from\\nthe castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks\\nwho took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.\\nThus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this\\nservice. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he\\ncame out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to\\narranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and\\nhe knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,\\nby murdering his agent.\\n\\n\\nI have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the\\nSlovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in\\nthe typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling\\nlevel with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,\\nwas on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or\\npoles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There\\nwould be no such sound if floating down stream.\\n\\n\\nOf course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may\\npossibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more\\neasily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza\\nwhich runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as\\nclose to Dracula\\'s castle as can be got by water.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal--continued._\\n\\n\\nWhen I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The\\nothers kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where\\nwe were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we\\nmay succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on\\nhim by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he\\nis powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry\\nhim may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw\\nhim in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,\\nto our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all\\nshall do.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I shall get a steam launch and follow him,\" said Lord Godalming.\\n\\n\\n\"And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,\" said Mr.\\nMorris.\\n\\n\\n\"Good!\" said the Professor, \"both good. But neither must go alone. There\\nmust be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and\\nrough, and he carries rude arms.\" All the men smiled, for amongst them\\nthey carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--\\n\\n\\n\"I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and\\nthere may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other\\nprecautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could\\nnot quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.\" Dr.\\nSeward said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt\\ntogether, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come\\nalong. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the\\nSlovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don\\'t suppose these fellows carry\\nguns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we\\nshall not rest until the Count\\'s head and body have been separated, and\\nwe are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.\" He looked at Jonathan as he\\nspoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was\\ntorn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the\\nboat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...\\nthe ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was\\nsilent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you\\nare young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the\\nlast; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has\\nwrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she\\nwill be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as\\nonce; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to\\nfight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in\\nother way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let\\nme say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and\\nfriend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and\\nwhilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be\\nlanded, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy\\'s\\ncountry. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running\\nstream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid\\nof his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to\\nperish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz\\nover the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam\\nMina\\'s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all\\ndark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near\\nthat fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be\\nmade sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.\" Here\\nJonathan interrupted him hotly:--\\n\\n\\n\"Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,\\nin her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil\\'s illness, right\\ninto the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or\\nHell!\" He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--\\n\\n\\n\"Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish\\ninfamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every\\nspeck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?\\nHave you felt the Vampire\\'s lips upon your throat?\" Here he turned to\\nme, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:\\n\"Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!\" and he sank\\ndown on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor\\'s voice, as he\\nspoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed\\nus all:--\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful\\nplace that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that\\nplace. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not\\nsee. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what\\nis to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in\\nterrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and\\nsubtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then\\nin time our dear one\"--he took my hand--\"would come to him to keep him\\ncompany, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have\\ntold us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they\\nclutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and\\nwell may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is\\nnecessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,\\npossibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,\\nit is I who would have to go to keep them company.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Do as you will,\" said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, \"we\\nare in the hands of God!\"\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.\\nHow can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and\\nso brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!\\nWhat can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do\\nwhen basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and\\nthat both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing\\nto spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could\\nnot start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within\\nanother hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each\\nof us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam\\nlaunch, with steam up ready to start at a moment\\'s notice. Dr. Seward\\nand Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have\\nall the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor\\nVan Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti,\\nwhere we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are\\nbringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and\\nhorses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust\\nin the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages,\\nso we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a\\nlarge-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like\\nthe rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my\\nforehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me\\nthat I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting\\ncolder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as\\nwarnings.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We may\\nnever meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly;\\nhis look is a warning. There must be no tears now--unless it may be that\\nGod will let them fall in gladness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnace\\ndoor of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an\\nexperienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his\\nown on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our\\nplans, we finally decided that Mina\\'s guess was correct, and that if any\\nwaterway was chosen for the Count\\'s escape back to his Castle, the\\nSereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took\\nit, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the\\nplace chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the\\nCarpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at\\nnight; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to\\nmake steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to\\nsleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on\\nwatch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging\\nover my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only\\ncomfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would\\nbe easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.\\nMorris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;\\nthey are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher\\nlands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following\\nof its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead\\ntheir spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When\\nthey dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look\\nafter the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they\\ncan mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and\\ncan be easily adapted for Mina, if required.\\n\\n\\nIt is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through\\nthe darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike\\nus; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes\\nhome. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into\\na whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the\\nfurnace door....\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_31 October._--Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming is\\nsleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat\\nis grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only\\na few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of\\nanything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every\\ntime we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and\\nprayed.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_1 November, evening._--No news all day; we have found nothing of the\\nkind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong\\nin our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big\\nand little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,\\nand treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,\\nso at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a\\nRoumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we\\nhave over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every\\ndeference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose\\nto ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,\\ngoing at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This\\nwas before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the\\nboat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu\\nwe could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the\\nnight. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell\\nupon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he\\nshall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor\\ndear Mina and me.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_2 November, morning._--It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not\\nwake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and\\nwas forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept\\nso long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new\\nman this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do\\nall that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and\\nkeeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to\\nme. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to\\nVeresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the\\ncarriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they\\nwould be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am\\nafraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we\\ncannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how\\nDr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless\\nstreams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them\\nare very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible\\ndoubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have\\nmet much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see\\nthem; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be\\nnecessary to take counsel together what to do next.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_2 November._--Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it\\nif there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the\\nrest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.\\nThose adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on;\\nwe shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_3 November._--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the\\nBistritza. I wish it wasn\\'t so cold. There are signs of snow coming; and\\nif it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge and\\ngo on, Russian fashion.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_4 November._--To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an\\naccident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats get\\nup all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up\\nonly a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and\\nevidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got\\nup the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase\\nafresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the\\npeasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept\\nstopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push\\non harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_31 October._--Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me that\\nthis morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all I\\ncould say was: \"dark and quiet.\" He is off now buying a carriage and\\nhorses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so\\nthat we may be able to change them on the way. We have something more\\nthan 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; if\\nonly we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to\\nsee it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a\\npleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something of\\ntheir life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and\\npicturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint\\npeople! But, alas!--\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_Later._--Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and\\nhorses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The\\nlandlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough\\nfor a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to\\nme that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He has\\nbeen shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats\\nand wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance of\\nour being cold.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nWe shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are\\ntruly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him,\\nwith all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over\\nmy beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I\\nloved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and\\ntruest thought will be always for him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\n\\n\\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The\\nhorses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go\\nwillingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many\\nchanges and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to\\nthink that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;\\nhe tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well\\nto make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and\\noff we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable\\nkinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full\\nof nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first\\nhouse where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my\\nforehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to\\nkeep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an\\nextra amount of garlic into our food; and I can\\'t abide garlic. Ever\\nsince then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have\\nescaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no\\ndriver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay\\nthat fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The\\nProfessor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he\\nmade me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he\\nsays that I answered as usual \"darkness, lapping water and creaking\\nwood\"; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of\\nJonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write\\nthis whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.\\nVan Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and\\ngrey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror\\'s; even in his sleep\\nhe is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make\\nhim rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,\\nand we must not break down when most of all his strength will be\\nneeded.... All is ready; we are off shortly.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_2 November, morning._--I was successful, and we took turns driving all\\nnight; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange\\nheaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean\\nthat it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep\\nus comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered\\n\"darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,\" so the river is changing as\\nthey ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of\\ndanger--more than need be; but we are in God\\'s hands.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_2 November, night._--All day long driving. The country gets wilder as\\nwe go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed\\nso far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us\\nand tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an\\neffort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.\\nVan Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The\\nhouses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse\\nwe got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He\\ngot two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude\\nfour-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no\\ntrouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can\\ndrive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive\\nbefore. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what\\nwill to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor\\ndarling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and\\nthat He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,\\nand who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His\\nsight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign\\nto let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred\\nHis wrath.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing._\\n\\n\\n_4 November._--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of\\nPurfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is\\nmorning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept\\nalive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey\\nheavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all\\nwinter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have\\naffected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was\\nnot like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual\\nso alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost\\nher appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so\\nfaithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.\\nHowever, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh\\nand restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset\\nI try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown\\nless and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,\\nGod\\'s will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!\\n\\n\\nNow to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I\\nmust, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go\\nunrecorded.\\n\\n\\nWe got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I\\nsaw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our\\ncarriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a\\ncouch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but\\nmore slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As\\nbefore, came the answer: \"darkness and the swirling of water.\" Then she\\nwoke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.\\nAt this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new\\nguiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--\\n\\n\\n\"This is the way.\"\\n\\n\\n\"How know you it?\" I ask.\\n\\n\\n\"Of course I know it,\" she answer, and with a pause, add: \"Have not my\\nJonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?\"\\n\\n\\nAt first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one\\nsuch by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach\\nroad from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and\\nmore of use.\\n\\n\\nSo we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we\\nsure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow\\nhave fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and\\nthey go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan\\nhave note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long\\nhours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and\\nshe succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to\\nsuspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may\\nnot wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm\\nher; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be\\nall-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel\\nguilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the\\nreins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I\\nlook down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset\\ntime, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,\\nso that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.\\nFor we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though\\nit were the end of the world.\\n\\n\\nThen I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and\\nthen I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as\\nthough I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and\\nmyself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.\\nMadam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,\\nand look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we\\nfirst enter the Count\\'s house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she\\nis so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I\\nlight a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she\\nprepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,\\nto feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go\\nto help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that\\nshe was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have\\ngrave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She\\nhelp me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the\\nfire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all\\nof watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying\\nquiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice\\nmore the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I\\nwake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes\\nobedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then\\nsleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have\\nto lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have\\nharnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look\\nin her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it\\nnot. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even\\nto think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and\\ndeath, or more than these, and we must not flinch.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n_5 November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though you\\nand I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think\\nthat I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long\\nstrain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.\\n\\n\\nAll yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and\\nmoving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,\\nfrowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held\\nsometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I\\ndid have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. I\\nbegan to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as\\nshe is with that Vampire baptism. \"Well,\" said I to myself, \"if it be\\nthat she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at\\nnight.\" As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and\\nimperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked\\nwith a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still\\nsleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning\\nmountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a\\nsteep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell\\nof in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,\\nthe end was near.\\n\\n\\nI woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!\\nunavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for\\neven after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and\\nall was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed\\nthem in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make\\nMadam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid\\nher rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that\\nshe had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But\\nI myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the\\nfear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round\\nwhere Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and\\nI broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the\\ntime--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the\\nsnow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she\\nclung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to\\nfeet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when\\nshe had grown more quiet:--\\n\\n\\n\"Will you not come over to the fire?\" for I wished to make a test of\\nwhat she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she\\nstopped, and stood as one stricken.\\n\\n\\n\"Why not go on?\" I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat\\ndown in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked\\nfrom sleep, she said simply:--\\n\\n\\n\"I cannot!\" and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she\\ncould not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be\\ndanger to her body, yet her soul was safe!\\n\\n\\nPresently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I\\ncame to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they\\nwhinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a\\ntime. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to\\nthe cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was\\nwith quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was\\nabout stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying\\nsweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of\\nsome kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the\\nsnow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with\\ntrailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses\\nwhinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to\\nfear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that\\nring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of\\nthe night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and\\nall the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan\\'s\\nhorrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist\\nbegan to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy\\nglimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses\\ncowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even\\nthe madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I\\nfeared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and\\ncircled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when\\nI would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held\\nme back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low\\nit was:--\\n\\n\\n\"No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!\" I turned to her, and\\nlooking in her eyes, said:--\\n\\n\\n\"But you? It is for you that I fear!\" whereat she laughed--a laugh, low\\nand unreal, and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them\\nthan I am,\" and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of\\nwind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.\\nThen, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the\\nwheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without\\nthe Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not\\ntake away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me\\nin actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when\\nthey would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the\\nbright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous\\nlips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came\\nthrough the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to\\nher, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were\\nof the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--\\n\\n\\n\"Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!\" In fear I turned to my poor\\nMadam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the\\nterror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my\\nheart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I\\nseized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the\\nWafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and\\nlaughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for\\nI knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not\\napproach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within\\nthe ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The\\nhorses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on\\nthem softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor\\nbeasts no more of terror.\\n\\n\\nAnd so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the\\nsnow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but\\nwhen that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.\\nAt the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the\\nwhirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away\\ntowards the castle, and were lost.\\n\\n\\nInstinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending\\nto hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I\\ncould not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made\\nno response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have\\nmade my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have\\nmuch to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there\\nmay be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist\\nobscure it, will be to me a safety.\\n\\n\\nI will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible\\nwork. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her\\nsleep....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_4 November, evening._--The accident to the launch has been a terrible\\nthing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;\\nand by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,\\noff on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we\\nfollow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We\\nhave our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only\\nMorris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more\\nGood-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._\\n\\n\\n_5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing\\naway from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a\\ncluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly\\nand there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own\\nfeelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of\\nwolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are\\ndangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,\\nand we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,\\nor where, or what, or when, or how it may be....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dr. Van Helsing\\'s Memorandum._\\n\\n\\n_5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy\\nat all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left\\nMadam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.\\nThe blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was\\nuseful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty\\nhinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that\\nbeing entered I might not get out. Jonathan\\'s bitter experience served\\nme here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I\\nknew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if\\nthere was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either\\nthere was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.\\nThen I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.\\nThe dilemma had me between his horns.\\n\\n\\nHer, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the\\nVampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I\\nresolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must\\nsubmit, if it were God\\'s will. At any rate it was only death and\\nfreedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the\\nchoice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than\\nthe grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.\\n\\n\\nI knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are\\ninhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her\\nVampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as\\nthough I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when\\nsuch things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,\\nfound at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,\\nand delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the\\nwanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset\\ncome, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair\\nwoman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a\\nkiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire\\nfold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...\\n\\n\\nThere is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence\\nof such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and\\nheavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such\\nas the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,\\nwith all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a\\nyearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my\\nvery soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the\\nstrange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it\\nwas that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields\\nto a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a\\nlong, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound\\nof a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.\\n\\n\\nThen I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching\\naway tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not\\npause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should\\nbegin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in\\na high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister\\nwhich, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of\\nthe mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so\\nexquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls\\nsome of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl\\nwith new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam\\nMina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought\\nfurther upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had\\nsearched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as\\nthere had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the\\nnight, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.\\nThere was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and\\nnobly proportioned. On it was but one word\\n\\n\\n                                DRACULA.\\n\\n\\nThis then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more\\nwere due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.\\nBefore I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my\\nawful work, I laid in Dracula\\'s tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished\\nhim from it, Un-Dead, for ever.\\n\\n\\nThen began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it\\nhad been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had\\nbeen through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet\\nMiss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived\\nthrough centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the\\nyears; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....\\n\\n\\nOh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by\\nthoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of\\nfear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though\\ntill all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen\\nthe repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just\\nere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been\\nwon, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have\\nendured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of\\nwrithing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and\\nleft my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them\\nnow and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death\\nfor a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife\\nsevered the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and\\ncrumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come\\ncenturies agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud \"I\\nam here!\"\\n\\n\\nBefore I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can\\nthe Count enter there Un-Dead.\\n\\n\\nWhen I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her\\nsleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.\\n\\n\\n\"Come!\" she said, \"come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my\\nhusband who is, I know, coming towards us.\" She was looking thin and\\npale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was\\nglad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the\\nfresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.\\n\\n\\nAnd so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet\\nour friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are\\ncoming to meet us.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Mina Harker\\'s Journal._\\n\\n\\n_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I\\ntook our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did\\nnot go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take\\nheavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being\\nleft without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our\\nprovisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we\\ncould see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of\\nhabitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy\\nwalking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the\\nclear line of Dracula\\'s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under\\nthe hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the\\nCarpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,\\nperched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with\\nseemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain\\non any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We\\ncould hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the\\nsound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was\\nfull of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about\\nthat he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less\\nexposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we\\ncould trace it through the drifted snow.\\n\\n\\nIn a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined\\nhim. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,\\nwith an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the\\nhand and drew me in: \"See!\" he said, \"here you will be in shelter; and\\nif the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.\" He brought in our\\nfurs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and\\nforced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was\\nrepulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could\\nnot bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not\\nreproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top\\nof the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--\\n\\n\\n\"Look! Madam Mina, look! look!\" I sprang up and stood beside him on the\\nrock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling\\nmore heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning\\nto blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the\\nsnow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we\\nwere it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the\\nwhite waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in\\nkinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far\\noff--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a\\ngroup of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a\\nlong leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog\\'s tail\\nwagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the\\nsnow as they were, I could see from the men\\'s clothes that they were\\npeasants or gypsies of some kind.\\n\\n\\nOn the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I\\nfelt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and\\nwell I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned\\nthere, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all\\npursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,\\nhowever, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round\\nthe rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last\\nnight. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--\\n\\n\\n\"At least you shall be safe here from _him_!\" He took the glasses from\\nme, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.\\n\"See,\" he said, \"they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and\\ngalloping as hard as they can.\" He paused and went on in a hollow\\nvoice:--\\n\\n\\n\"They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God\\'s will be\\ndone!\" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole\\nlandscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his\\nglasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--\\n\\n\\n\"Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the\\nsouth. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow\\nblots it all out!\" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward\\nand Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.\\nAt the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around\\nI saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at\\nbreak-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,\\nof course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with\\nthe cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,\\nand, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he\\nlaid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the\\nopening of our shelter. \"They are all converging,\" he said. \"When the\\ntime comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.\" I got out my revolver\\nready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came\\nlouder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.\\nIt was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,\\nand beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down\\ntowards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could\\nsee here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger\\nnumbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.\\n\\n\\nEvery instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in\\nfierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in\\ncircling eddies. At times we could not see an arm\\'s length before us;\\nbut at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to\\nclear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of\\nlate been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew\\nwith fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the\\nsun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less\\nthan an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various\\nbodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer\\nand more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly\\nhad driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,\\nthe snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each\\nparty, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did\\nnot seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they\\nseemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower\\nand lower on the mountain tops.\\n\\n\\nCloser and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind\\nour rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined\\nthat they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our\\npresence.\\n\\n\\nAll at once two voices shouted out to: \"Halt!\" One was my Jonathan\\'s,\\nraised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris\\' strong resolute\\ntone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but\\nthere was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were\\nspoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming\\nand Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the\\nother. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his\\nhorse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his\\ncompanions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang\\nforward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an\\nunmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van\\nHelsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.\\nSeeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew\\nup. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the\\ngypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held\\nhimself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.\\n\\n\\nThe leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in\\nfront, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill\\ntops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.\\nFor answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses\\nand dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing\\nJonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been\\nupon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,\\nsurging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our\\nparties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly\\nformed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one\\nshouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the\\norder.\\n\\n\\nIn the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring\\nof men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was\\nevident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun\\nshould set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the\\nlevelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor\\nthe howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their\\nattention. Jonathan\\'s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his\\npurpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they\\ncowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the\\ncart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great\\nbox, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.\\nMorris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of\\nSzgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,\\nwith the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had\\nseen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and\\nthey cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first\\nI thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang\\nbeside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that\\nwith his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was\\nspurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for\\nas Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,\\nattempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked\\nthe other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the\\nlid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and\\nthe top of the box was thrown back.\\n\\n\\nBy this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,\\nand at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made\\nno resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the\\nshadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count\\nlying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from\\nthe cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen\\nimage, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I\\nknew too well.\\n\\n\\nAs I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them\\nturned to triumph.\\n\\n\\nBut, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan\\'s great knife.\\nI shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same\\nmoment Mr. Morris\\'s bowie knife plunged into the heart.\\n\\n\\nIt was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the\\ndrawing of a breath, the whole body crumble into dust and passed from\\nour sight.\\n\\n\\nI shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final\\ndissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never\\ncould have imagined might have rested there.\\n\\n\\nThe Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone\\nof its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the\\nsetting sun.\\n\\n\\nThe gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary\\ndisappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as\\nif for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the\\nleiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,\\nwhich had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving\\nus alone.\\n\\n\\nMr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his\\nhand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I\\nflew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the\\ntwo doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his\\nhead on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand\\nin that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of\\nmy heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--\\n\\n\\n\"I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!\" he cried\\nsuddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, \"It was\\nworth for this to die! Look! look!\"\\n\\n\\nThe sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams\\nfell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse\\nthe men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest \"Amen\" broke from all\\nas their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man\\nspoke:--\\n\\n\\n\"Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not\\nmore stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!\"\\n\\n\\nAnd, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a\\ngallant gentleman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  NOTE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSeven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of\\nsome of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It\\nis an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy\\'s birthday is the same\\nday as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the\\nsecret belief that some of our brave friend\\'s spirit has passed into\\nhim. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but\\nwe call him Quincey.\\n\\n\\nIn the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went\\nover the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and\\nterrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things\\nwhich we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were\\nliving truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The\\ncastle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.\\n\\n\\nWhen we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all\\nlook back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily\\nmarried. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since\\nour return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the\\nmass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one\\nauthentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later\\nnote-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing\\'s memorandum.\\nWe could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as\\nproofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with\\nour boy on his knee:--\\n\\n\\n\"We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day\\nknow what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her\\nsweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so\\nloved her, that they did dare much for her sake.\"']"
